        <h1>Adam Curry</h1>
        <p>Crackpot – Host of The No Agenda Show</p>
        <p>
          Adam’s nickname for the show is the Crackpot. That’s not just because he occasionally smokes some weed, it’s
          because Adam believes in his ideas and follows through on them, no matter how crazy they sound. With the radio
          skills that he developed during his younger years working as a Dutch radio host and an MTV VJ in the USA, all
          of his podcasts are professional produced while being live recorded on the internet.
        </p>
        <h2>The Podfather</h2>
        <p>
          Many people know Adam as
          the Podfather because he was the first one to publish a podcast, The Daily Source Code, on the internet
          after he worked with Dave Winer to create the podcast specification, based on RSS. This later became known as the
          <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/support/823-podcast-requirements">iTunes Podcast Specification</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interpretation of what a podcast is has changed dramatically over the years. Back then the term podcast
          was only used to refer to feed-based podcasts that implemented the podcast specification,
          but that’s generally not the case anymore. These days a podcast is just a series of video or audio shows published
          anywhere on the internet. You’d think that would make Adam happy, but he actually isn’t happy with it at all.
          You’re holding your podcast wrong, so he started the <a href="https://podcastindex.org/">PodcastIndex</a>
          initiative to change that. Making sure people can listen to podcasts published through the open podcasting
          ecosystem ensures free speech can thrive on the internet, and he’s teaching people more about it in his
          <a href="{{ podcasting20_podcast_url }}">Podcasting 2.0 podcast</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Personal Life</h2>
        <p>
          Together with Tina the Keeper, Adam lives in the beautiful
          Texas Hill Country, an area that reflects his beliefs in free speech and gun rights. His pronouns are him/his.
          Because the content Adam and his co-host <a href="{{ path('john') }}">John</a> produce isn’t welcome at
          advertising-supported media platforms run by big corporations, they have taken a vow to poverty by running No
          Agenda under the value-for-value model. This has paid off as the show has been running for 16 years and counting.
        </p>
