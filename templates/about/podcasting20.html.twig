  <h1>Podcasting 2.0</h1>
  <p>
    The podcasting ecosystem was built on open standard to make it easy for anyone to share their
    podcast with the world without intervention. Throughout the years, apps and services from big tech corporations
    have added podcasts to their portfolio, but use those podcasts to further increase their hold on the podcasting
    ecosystem. This is especially dangerous in a time when people get deplatformed for not conforming to the
    mainstream narrative. To combat these trends, <a href="{{ path('adam') }}">Adam</a> and his buddy
    <a href="{{ davejones_url }}">Dave Jones</a> bootstrapped the Podcasting 2.0 movement by creating
    <a href="{{ podcastindex_url }}">PodcastIndex</a>, a searchable directory of podcasts published on the internet,
    supported by the value-for-value model.
  </p>

    board meeting in the <a href="{{ podcasting20_podcast_url }}">Podcasting 2.0 podcast</a>.

  <h2>New Podcast Features</h2>
  <p>
    Taking back control from big tech isn't our only goal. Podcasts are here to stay, but even though the
    popularity of podcasts has skyrocketed, there has been little innovation in the open podcasting ecosystem
    in the years since Adam <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFOQk5pz2fo">helped develop the original
      podcast specification</a>. So he's taken it upon himself to do it again by bringing new features to podcasts
    through a new <a href="{{ podcast_namespace_url }}">podcast specification</a>, detailing features that
    podcasters and developers can implement in their projects. Some of these features are listed below.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not all podcast apps support these features, that's why we've curated <a href="{{ podcastindex_apps_url }}">a list of apps</a>
    you can try to experience the future of podcasting right now!

  <h3>Payments</h3>
  <p>
    Thanks to Lightning, monetary value can be exchanged instantly without friction. Integrating payments into
    the podcasting ecosystem is part of the <a href="{{ value4value_url }}">value-for-value model</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>Live Items</h3>
  <p>
    Podcasts that are recorded live on the internet used to resort to social media to let their listeners know
    when they are going live. With live items integrated right into the podcast feed, podcast apps can notify
    their users when their favorite show is going live, so you never miss a live show again.
  </p>
  <h3>Chapters</h3>
  <p>
    Podcasts can create a chapter list for their episodes with custom art associated to each chapter. Don't just
    tell your listeners, show them what you're talking about.
  </p>
  <h3>Transcripts</h3>
  <p>
    Transcripts offer many advantages to listeners. They might be non-native speakers or simply experiencing
    hearing problems. Being able to read along with a podcast helps your listeners understand and focus
    on the content.
  </p>
  <h2>Let's Get Social</h2>
  <p>
    To change the future of podcasting we need input from podcasters, developers and listeners to come up with
    the right solutions. Join us to help us make podcasting better for everyone.

  <h2>No Agenda Website</h2>
  <p>
    The No Agenda website supports and even pioneered many of the features provided by Podcasting 2.0. This is
    possible thanks to support of our producers under the value-for-value model.
