  <h1>No Agenda Website</h1>
  <p>
    The website of The No Agenda Show was created by <a href="https://www.codedmonkey.com">Tim</a> under the
    value-for-value model (completely voluntarily). Originally designed as an archive of the show, the website
    is now a full custom-built podcast app for our show, complete with
    <a href="{{ path('about_podcasting20') }}">Podcasting 2.0</a> integration.

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <p>
    The No Agenda website is custom-built for listeners of No Agenda. While most podcast websites are just a list
    of episodes, our website integrates transcripts, chapters and shownotes with an integrated player that remembers
    where you stopped listening. You can also subscribe to notifications for new episodes and the bat signal (when we
    go live).

  <h3>Not Receiving Push Notifications</h3>
  <p>
    In case you've subscribed to push notifications but haven't received any, your browser might not support push notifications.
    Try enabling push notifications in a different browser, like <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Firefox</a>.
    If you have an iPhone or iPad, push notifications can't be enabled until Apple adds support to Safari (this is also the
    case for Safari users on Mac).

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    When I started listening to No Agenda in 2014, the No Agenda website <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150214010631/http://www.noagendashow.com/">wasn't anything to write home about</a>.
    Like many other podcast websites, it simply republished the podcast feed as a website. It didn't include
    all past episodes (the archive was hosted separately), it also didn't include shownotes since those are hosted directly
    on Adam's website. But Adam publishes everything for free, and has gone the extra length to make the data from his projects
    machine-readable so websites and apps can use the data from No Agenda. He actively encourages producers
    to use this data for themselves, and <a href="{{ path('producers', {'_fragment': 'projects'}) }}">lots of producers do</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a <a href="{{ path('about_dudesnamedben') }}">dude named Ben</a>, I immediately wanted to build an archive for
    No Agenda. Another producer built noagendaplayer.com, which allowed you to play No Agenda from the browser, and
    even started hinting at support for transcripts, when producer Clogwog started publishing transcripts of the show
    he generated online on noagendatranscripts.tr and linking the transcripts to a YouTube-video. Adam heavily started
    promoting these websites, but unfortunately noagendaplayer.com often didn't update correctly.
  </p>
  <h3>No Agenda Experience</h3>
  <p>
    My dream to create a full archive of No Agenda started by building a website that combined the shownotes, the
    automatically generated transcripts and an archive of the troll room during recordings into a single page. Additionaly,
    I created a system for producers to create their own chapters, so producers could help divide the show into topics
    for a potential archive.
  </p>
  <p>
    The name of my project became <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200521082046/https://www.noagendaexperience.com/">No Agenda Experience</a>.
    A parody on <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em>, which in turn is a reference to <em>The Jimi Hendrix Experience</em>.
    No Agenda Social just launched, so I started publishing links to new episodes under the pseudonym <em>Woodstock</em>,
    allowing the project to spread in the community.
  </p>
  <p>
    One day, Adam was talking in the show about new projects and how he saw potential for a renaissance in the podcasting
    community (a precursor to <a href="{{ path('about_podcasting20') }}">Podcasting 2.0</a>). I've emailed him about my
    project, and he immediately asked me if I wanted it to become the official No Agenda website, and we never had a fight.
  </p>
  <p>
    Multiple rewrites of the website later, my plans to turn this website into a No Agenda archive have turned into making
    a general purpose podcasting player on the web. Maintaining an archive of the troll room during recordings and a
    database of producer-contributed chapters proved difficult for many reasons and Podcasting 2.0 increased the bar
    for how a podcasting website should work. I still want to build a full No Agenda archive, but I don't have the time or treasure
    to do both (yet) so <a href="{{ codedmonkey_donate_url }}">please donate</a> if you want to see this come to life.
