        More than 1500 episodes have been recorded over the 15 years that the show is running, and they're all
        available in this archive for you to enjoy! Throughout the years, we've added more elements to the show's
        formula including unique artwork for every show, shownotes with reference material and auto-generated
        transcripts.
