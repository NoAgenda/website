        <h1>No Agenda Shownotes</h1>
        <p>
          The shownotes of No Agenda offer a unique perspective into the current events of every episode, with articles,
          videos, boots-on-the-ground reports and important documents collected by our producers and curated by Adam
          before the show starts. They're used by teachers, students and researchers all around the world
          as a source of information for their work. If you think a piece of media or report needs to be mentioned in
          the shownotes, send it to <a href="{{ path('adam') }}">Adam</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the show's lifetime, No Agenda has evolved from being a simple podcast with
          no ads, no jingles and no agenda, into a community-supported platform for media deconstruction. No Agenda
          doesn't rely on fancy creator tools like the millennials you see on social media, however, we do rely on
          <a href="{{ dudenamedben_team_url }}">a team of tech experts</a> who've created unique tools to make our show
          possible. One of these tools is the Freedom Controller.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Freedom Controller was created by <a href="{{ davejones_url }}">Dave Jones</a> at Adam's
          request as a way to collect and publish the shownotes alongside an episode as an OPML-file. This makes the
          shownotes not only readable by human resources, but also by machines. Publishing the shownotes in a
          machine-readable format is an important aspect of our formula as it allows apps to read and use our shownotes
          for their own experiences, like this website and the search engines made specifically for our shownotes:
          <a href="https://noagendaquery.com/">No Agenda Query</a>, <a href="https://noagendaquest.com/">No Agenda Quest</a>
          and <a href="http://noagendle.com/">Noagendle</a>. These tools have replaced the Freedom Controller as the
          primary way to access the shownotes, but have made it an even more important part of our technology stack.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first episode with shownotes, <a href="{{ path('podcast_episode', {code: '577'}) }}">show 577</a>,
          was published in December 2013. A full list of shownotes, as published by the Freedom Controller, is available
          at <a href="http://archive.noagendanotes.com/">archive.noagendanotes.com</a>.
