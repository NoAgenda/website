Early in her tenure, she made multiple diplomatic visits with western leaders to promote her vision of peace in the region. The outbreak of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 caught Israel off guard and inflicted severe early losses on the army. The resulting public anger damaged Meir's reputation and led to an inquiry into the failings. Her Alignment coalition was denied a majority in the subsequent legislative election; she resigned the following year and was succeeded as prime minister by Yitzhak Rabin. Meir died in 1978 of lymphoma and was buried on Mount Herzl."/>

						<outline text="Belgian Psychotherapist and Author (born 1958)"/>
						<outline text="Esther Perel (born 1958) is a Belgian-American psychotherapist, known for her work on human relationships.[1]"/>
						<outline text="Perel promoted the concept of &quot;erotic intelligence&quot; in her book Mating in Captivity: Unlocking Erotic Intelligence (2006), which has been translated into 24 languages.[2] After publishing the book, she became an international advisor on sex and relationships.[3] She has given two TED talks, hosts two podcasts, runs a series of therapy training / supervision events,[4] and launched a card game.[5][6][7]"/>
						<outline text="In 2016, Perel was added to Oprah Winfrey's Supersoul 100 list of visionaries and influential leaders.[8]"/>
						<outline text="Early life and education   [ edit ]  Perel was born and raised in Antwerp, Belgium, the daughter of Sala Ferlegier and Icek Perel,[9] two Polish, Jewish, Holocaust survivors.[10] She has one brother, Leon.[9]"/>
						<outline text="Perel attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel,[11] where she earned a B.A. in educational psychology and French literature, and subsequently earned a master's degree in expressive art therapy from Lesley University in Cambridge, Massachusetts in the United States.[9]"/>
						<outline text="Perel grew up amongst Holocaust survivors in Antwerp, later categorising them into two groups: &quot;those who didn't die, and those who came back to life&quot;.[5] She asserts that &quot;those who came back to life were those who understood eroticism as an antidote to death.&quot;[5][12]"/>
						<outline text="Career   [ edit ]  Perel subsequently trained in psychodynamic psychotherapy before finding a professional home in family systems theory.[13] She initially worked as a cross-cultural psychotherapist with couples and families. For 13 years she was a clinical instructor at the New York University School of Medicine.[14]"/>
						<outline text="Perel has also worked as an actress (appearing in the 2017 film, Newness, as herself) and run a clothing boutique in Antwerp.[11]"/>
						<outline text="Perel in Boston in 2017Personal life   [ edit ]  Perel is Jewish, and says of it, &quot;You can't know me without it.&quot;[9]"/>
						<outline text="Perel is married to Jack Saul, Assistant Professor of Clinical Population and Family Health at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.[15] They met  at Lesley University[9] when she was 22[16][17] or 23[18] and he was 7 years her senior.[17] After 2 years of being close friends, they became a couple.[17][18] She says she &quot;swallowed the romantic ideal quite a bit&quot; in her youth.[16]"/>
						<outline text="Ideas   [ edit ]  Perel argues that, due to trends such as the secularization of Western society, the rise of individualism, and the societal &quot;mandate&quot; for personal happiness, the expectations for romantic relationships are higher than ever:[19]"/>
						<outline text="Never before have our expectations of marriage taken on such epic proportions. We still want everything the traditional family was meant to provide'--security, children, property, and respectability'--but now we also want our partner to love us, to desire us, to be interested in us. We should be best friends, trusted confidants, and passionate lovers to boot.[20]"/>
						<outline text="She also notes the ideals of modern marriage are often contradictory: &quot;We want our chosen one to offer stability, safety, predictability, and dependability'--all the anchoring experiences. And we want that very same person to supply awe, mystery, adventure, and risk.&quot;[20] Perel calls for a more open and honest discussion of monogamy to reconcile this conflict between the erotic and the domestic."/>
						<outline text="Podcasts   [ edit ]  Perel is the host of two podcasts: Where Should We Begin? and How's Work?"/>
						<outline text="Where Should We Begin? brings the listeners inside Perel's therapist's office as she sees anonymous couples in search of insight on everything from infidelity to sexlessness to grief. The unique format combines live recordings of the therapy session, with Perel's reflections on what she heard, and what techniques she tried.[21][22] The New York Times writes: &quot;it feels more like an unraveling mystery story than a relationship advice show.&quot;[23] The couples include both heterosexual and same-sex couples. The first episode aired on Audible in May 2017, and became publicly available on iTunes on October 9, 2017.[24] Three seasons have been released as of December 2019[update]. &quot;Where Should We Begin?&quot; received a 2018 Gracie Award.[25]How's Work? is Perel's second podcast. It follows a format similar to the couples therapy session in &quot;Where Should We Begin?&quot;, but this time the couple seeking Perel's advice are cofounders or colleagues, navigating the challenges that play out in work relationships.[26][27] HuffPost describes each episode as a &quot;one-time therapy session between Perel and various co-founders, members of family businesses and partners with a thriving operation but deteriorating relations on the job.&quot;[28] As described in one review: &quot;The podcast aims to shine light on the things that form us as individuals and how those things relate to life in the workplace. Because, honestly, a lot of people hold their careers and workplace relationships as dearly and tightly as they do their romantic relationships.&quot;[29] &quot;How's Work?&quot; was created by Gimlet Media, and was available exclusively on Spotify.[30] The show first aired in November 2019.[31] In March 2023, Bloomberg announced that &quot;How's Work?&quot; was acquired by Vox Media's Podcast Network.[32]Publications   [ edit ]  Mating in Captivity: Unlocking Erotic Intelligence (2006, Harper, ISBN 978-0060753634)The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity (2017, Harper, ISBN 978-0062322586)Recognition   [ edit ]  2016: Named to Oprah Winfrey's Supersoul 100 list of visionaries and influential leaders.[33]Perel was selected for the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50; made up of entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists and creators who are over the age of 50.[34]References   [ edit ]   ^   Perel, Esther. &quot;Erotic Intelligence: Reconciling Sensuality and Domesticity&quot;  (PDF) .

						<outline text="Prime Minister of Israel from 1969 to 1974"/>
						<outline text="Golda Meir[nb 1] (n(C)e Mabovitch ; 3 May 1898 '' 8 December 1978) was an Israeli politician who served as the fourth prime minister of Israel from 1969 to 1974. She was Israel's first and only female head of government, the first female head of government in the Middle East, and the fourth elected female head of government or state in the world.[5]"/>
						<outline text="Born in Kiev in the Russian Empire to Jewish parents, Meir immigrated as a child with her family to the United States in 1906. She graduated from the Milwaukee State Normal School and found work as a teacher. While in Milwaukee, she embraced the Labor Zionist movement. In 1921, Meir and her husband emigrated to Mandatory Palestine, settling in Merhavia, later becoming the kibbutz's representative to the Histadrut. In 1934, she was elevated to the executive committee of the trade union. Meir held several key roles in the Jewish Agency during and after World War II. She was a signatory of the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948. Meir was elected to the Knesset in 1949 and served as Labor Minister until 1956, when she was appointed Foreign Minister by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. She retired from the ministry in 1966 due to ill health."/>
						<outline text="In 1969, Meir assumed the role of prime minister following the death of Levi Eshkol. Early in her tenure, she made multiple diplomatic visits with western leaders to promote her vision of peace in the region. The outbreak of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 caught Israel off guard and inflicted severe early losses on the army. The resulting public anger damaged Meir's reputation and led to an inquiry into the failings. Her Alignment coalition was denied a majority in the subsequent legislative election; she resigned the following year and was succeeded as prime minister by Yitzhak Rabin. Meir died in 1978 of lymphoma and was buried on Mount Herzl."/>
						<outline text="A controversial figure in Israel, Meir has been lionized as a founder of the state and described as the &quot;Iron Lady&quot; of Israeli politics, but also widely blamed for the country being caught by surprise during the war of 1973. In addition, her dismissive statements towards the Palestinians were widely scorned.[6] Most historians believe Meir was more successful as Secretary of Labor and Housing than as Premier.[7]"/>
						<outline text="Early life Golda Mabovitch, before 1910Golda Mabovitch was born to a Ukrainian Jewish family[8] in downtown Kiev,[9] Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine) on May 3, 1898, to Blume Neiditch (died 1951) and Moshe Mabovitch (died 1944), a carpenter. Meir wrote in her autobiography that her earliest memories were of her father boarding up the front door in response to rumours of an imminent pogrom. She had two sisters, Sheyna (born 1889) and Tzipke (born 1902), as well as five other siblings who died in childhood."/>
						<outline text="Meir's father, Moshe, left the country to find work in New York City in 1903.[10] In his absence, the rest of the family moved to Pinsk (present-day Belarus) to join her mother's family. In 1905, Moshe moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in search of higher-paying work, and found employment in the workshops of the local railroad yard. The following year, he had saved up enough money to bring his family to the United States. Golda along with her mother and sisters landed in Quebec and traveled to Milwaukee by train.[11]"/>
						<outline text="Meir's mother ran a grocery store on Milwaukee's north side. By age eight, Meir was often put in charge of watching the store when her mother went to buy supplies. She attended the Fourth Street Grade School (now Golda Meir School) from 1906 to 1912. A leader early on, she and a close friend, Regina Hamburger, organized the American Young Sisters Society, a fundraiser to pay for her classmates' textbooks in 1908. As part of the organization's activities, she rented a hall and scheduled a public meeting for the event. Despite frequent tardiness due to having to work in her mother's store, she graduated as valedictorian of her class.[11]"/>
						<outline text="In 1912, she began studying at North Division High School and worked part-time. Her employers included Schuster's department store and the Milwaukee Public Library.[12][13] Her mother wanted Golda to leave school and marry, but she declined."/>
						<outline text="On 17 February 1913, Meir took a train to live with her married sister, Sheyna Korngold, in Denver, Colorado.[14] There, Meir attended North High School.[11] The Korngolds held intellectual evenings at their home, where Meir was exposed to debates on Zionism, literature, women's suffrage, trade unionism, and more. In her autobiography, she wrote: &quot;To the extent that my own future convictions were shaped and given form  ... those talk-filled nights in Denver played a considerable role.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Around 1913, she began dating her future husband Morris Meyerson, a sign painter and socialist.[15][16]"/>
						<outline text="Return to Milwaukee, Zionist activism, and teaching Golda Mabovitch in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 1914In 1914, after disagreements with her sister, Golda left North High School, moved out of her sister's home, and found work. After reconciling with her parents, she returned to Milwaukee and resumed studies at North Division High, graduating in 1915. While there, she became an active member of Young Poale Zion, which later became Habonim, the Labor Zionist youth movement. She spoke at public meetings and embraced Socialist Zionism.[17][11]"/>
						<outline text="She attended the teachers college Milwaukee State Normal School (now University of Wisconsin''Milwaukee) in 1916, and likely part of 1917. In 1917, she took a position at a Yiddish-speaking Folks Schule in Milwaukee. There, she further embraced Labor Zionism."/>
						<outline text="On 9 July 1917, Golda became a naturalized US citizen, as her father had naturalized, and at that time children of naturalized citizens under the age of 21 received citizenship by descent.[11]"/>
						<outline text="On 24 December 1917, Meir and Meyerson married. However, Meir's precondition for marriage was to settle in Palestine.[18] She had intended to make aliyah (immigration to Israel) straight away, but her plans were disrupted when all transatlantic passenger services were canceled due to the entry of the United States into the First World War.[19] She then threw her energies into Poale Zion activities. A short time after their wedding, she embarked on a fund-raising campaign for Poale Zion that took her across the United States.[18]"/>
						<outline text="Immigration to Mandatory Palestine Golda Meir in the fields at Kibbutz Merhavia (1920s)In 1921, after the conclusion of the war, the couple moved to Palestine, then part of the British Mandate, along with Meir's sister Sheyna, Sheyna's daughter, and Meir's childhood friend Regina. They sailed on the SS Pocahontas, from New York to Naples, then from there to Tel Aviv by train. Meir's parents subsequently moved to Palestine in 1926.[16][11]"/>
						<outline text="They were eventually accepted into kibbutz Merhavia in the Jezreel Valley after an initial rejected application. Her duties included picking almonds, planting trees, working in the chicken coops, and running the kitchen. Recognizing her leadership abilities, the kibbutz chose her as its representative to the Histadrut, the General Federation of Labour."/>
						<outline text="In 1924, the couple left the kibbutz and lived briefly in Tel Aviv before settling in Jerusalem. There, they had two children: a son Menachem in 1924, and a daughter Sarah in 1926.[21] Meir returned to Merhavia for a brief period in 1925.[11]"/>
						<outline text="Early political career In 1928, Meir was elected secretary of Moetzet HaPoalot (Working Women's Council). She spent two years (1932''34) in the United States as an emissary for the organization and to get expert medical treatment for her daughter's kidney illness.[22][11]"/>
						<outline text="In 1934, when Meir returned from the United States, she joined the Executive Committee of the Histadrut and moved up the ranks to become the head of its Political Department. This appointment was important training for her future role in Israeli leadership.[23]"/>
						<outline text="In July 1938, Meir was the Jewish observer from Palestine at the vian Conference, called by President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States to discuss the question of Jewish refugees' fleeing Nazi persecution. Delegates from the 32 invited countries repeatedly expressed their sorrow for the plight of the European Jews, but refused to admit the refugees.[24] The only exception was the Dominican Republic, which pledged to accept 100,000 refugees on generous terms.[25] Meir was disappointed at the outcome and she remarked to the press, &quot;There is only one thing I hope to see before I die and that is that my people should not need expressions of sympathy anymore.&quot;[15]"/>
						<outline text="Throughout World War II, Meir served several key roles in the Jewish Agency, which functioned as the government of British Palestine.[26]"/>
						<outline text="In June 1946, Meir became acting head of the Political Department of the Jewish Agency after the British arrested Moshe Sharett and other leaders of the Yishuv as part of Operation Agatha. This was a critical moment in her career: she became the principal negotiator between the Jews in Palestine and the British Mandatory authorities. After his release, Sharett went to the United States to attend talks on the UN Partition Plan, leaving Meir to head the Political Department until the establishment of the state in 1948.[23]"/>
						<outline text="In 1947, she traveled to Cyprus to meet Jewish detainees of the Cyprus internment camps, who had been interned by the British after being caught trying to illegally enter Palestine, and persuade them to give priority to families with children to fill the small quota of detainees allowed into Palestine. She was largely successful in this task.[11][citation needed ]"/>
						<outline text="Role in the Palestine War and the establishment of Israel On 17 November 1947, shortly before the outbreak of the 1947-1949 Palestine war, Meir met with King Abdullah I of Jordan. Abdullah I was seen as the only Arab leader willing to ally with a future Israeli state, as he also opposed the Mufti of Jerusalem and was rivals with other Arab countries. The meeting was cordial and confirmed that Abdullah was uninterested in invading and quietly willing to cooperate in future.[27]"/>
						<outline text="First phase of the war Golda Meir in Haifa, 1947For most of the war, Meir reluctantly played what she felt was a minor role in Israel's activities. An article published by the Golda Meir institute said &quot;she felt she was being pushed aside to a secondary arena&quot;.[26]"/>
						<outline text="However, she played a critical role in fundraising. In January 1948, the Jewish agency needed to raise funds for the continuing war and the coming Israeli state. The treasurer of the Jewish Agency was convinced that they would not be able to raise more than $7 to $8 million from the American Jewish community. Meir raised over $30 million.[26] Key to her success was an emotional speech she first delivered in Chicago on 22 January.[28] She toured dozens of cities in the United States and returned to Israel on 18 March.[27]"/>
						<outline text="The funds were critical to the success of the war effort and the establishment of Israel; by comparison, the opposing Arab Higher Committee's annual budget was around $2.25 million, similar to Haganah's annual budget before the war.[29] Ben-Gurion wrote that Meir's role as the &quot;Jewish woman who got the money which made the state possible&quot; would go down in history.[18]"/>
						<outline text="However, upon returning home, she suffered a political setback. The Jewish Agency and National Council Executives excluded her from the 13-member cabinet of the provisional government of Israel, and only included her in the 37-member People's Council. Ben-Gurion protested this, saying &quot;It is inconceivable that there shall be no adequate woman'...it is a moral and political necessity, for the Yishuv, the Jewish world and the Arab world.&quot; At one point, he even considered offering her his spot on the cabinet.[27]"/>
						<outline text="On 13 April, she was hospitalized in Tel Aviv due to a suspected heart attack. Ben-Gurion and the political department heads urged her to guard her health and come to Jerusalem as soon as she could. They asked her to be &quot;the mother of this city&quot;, and that her &quot;words to 100,000 residents will be a source of blessing and encouragement&quot;.[27] However, she felt it was a secondary and temporary role."/>
						<outline text="Instead, on 6 May, she visited Haifa after its 22 April occupation by Hagannah. This trip had a significant impact on her. There, she witnessed an elderly Arab woman emerging from a destroyed house, clutching to her few remaining belongings. When the two women made eye contact, they burst into tears. Meir went on to call the mass expulsion and flight of Arabs before the 1948 Palestine war &quot;dreadful&quot;, and likened it to what befall the Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe.[30] She returned to Tel Aviv, and eventually to Jerusalem two weeks before the end of the mandate.[27]"/>
						<outline text="On 10 May, Meir had a second meeting with Abdullah I. She travelled to Amman in secret, disguised as an Arab woman. He proposed that Palestine be absorbed into Jordan, with autonomy granted to majority-Jewish areas. Golda rejected the proposal. It then seemed likely that Abdullah I would invade.[27]"/>
						<outline text="Second phase of the war and appointment to Minister Plenipotentiary On 14 May 1948, Meir became one of 24 signatories (including two women) of the Israeli Declaration of Independence. She later recalled, &quot;After I signed, I cried. When I studied American history as a schoolgirl and I read about those who signed the U.S. Declaration of Independence, I couldn't imagine these were real people doing something real. And there I was sitting down and signing a declaration of establishment.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="A day after independence, the second phase of the war began. Meir also suddenly lost her job and administrative responsibilities, as the Political Department became the provisional Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and her leadership role in Jerusalem was taken over by Dov Yosef."/>
						<outline text="On 18 May, she embarked on a second and even more successful fundraising tour in which she raised around $50 million. In total, her fundraising efforts raised around $90 million, around a third of the cost of the war ($275 million).[26] During preparations for this trip, she was issued the first Israeli passport.[27][31][32] Over the ten weeks that she was gone, Israel was battered by the war and changed drastically."/>
						<outline text="On 25 June, while still in the United States, Meir was appointed by Sharett, then the Minister of Foreign Affairs, as the minister plenipotentiary to the Soviet Union, which recently recognized Israel."/>
						<outline text="Meir was displeased by the offer. She spoke no Russian and feared being lonely in Moscow. She said &quot;At last we have a state. I want to be there. I don't want to go thousands of miles away. Why do I always have to go away?&quot;[27]"/>
						<outline text="Her return to Israel was delayed due to a car crash in which she tore a ligament and fractured a bone.[27] Soviet officials refused to believe she was in hospital and wanted an Israeli envoy as soon as possible. Thus she ignored doctor's orders to rest and returned to Israel on 29 July. Years later, her leg would frequently pain her."/>
						<outline text="Government career before premiereship  Minister Plenipotentiary to the Soviet Union (1948''1949) Meir surrounded by crowd of 50,000 Jews near Moscow Choral Synagogue on the first day of Rosh Hashanah in 1948. This image later appeared on the 1984 10,000-shekel banknote.Meir served as minister plenipotentiary to the Soviet Union from 2 September 1948 to 10 March 1949.[33]"/>
						<outline text="She was reportedly impatient with diplomatic niceties and using interpreters. She did not drink or ballroom dance and had little interest in gossip and fashion. According to her interpreter, when asked by a Russian ambassador how she traveled to Moscow, she responded &quot;tell His Excellency the Ambassador that we arrived riding on donkeys&quot;.[27]"/>
						<outline text="This was an important and difficult role. Good relations with the Soviet Union impacted Israel's ability to secure arms from Eastern European countries. In turn, Joseph Stalin and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov saw its relationship with Israel as a means of furthering the Soviet position in the Middle East.[34] However, Soviet''Israeli relations were complicated by Soviet policies against religious institutions and nationalist movements, made manifest in actions to shut down Jewish religious institutions as well as the ban on Hebrew language study and the prohibition of promoting emigration to Israel.[35]"/>
						<outline text="Just 20 days after her term began, antisemitic crackdowns began in response to an article by Soviet Jewish writer Ilya Ehrenburg.[36] Meir and the other Israeli representatives responded by making a point of visiting Russian Jewish businesses, synagogues, and performances.[33]"/>
						<outline text="On 3 October, during Rosh Hashanah celebrations at the Moscow Choral Synagogue, she was mobbed by thousands of Russian Jews chanting in Russian &quot;Nasha Golda&quot;, meaning &quot;Our Golda&quot;. In her autobiography she said &quot;I felt as though I had been caught up in a torrent of love so strong that it had literally taken my breath away and slowed down my heart.&quot; This event was commemorated by the Israeli 10,000-shekel banknote issued in November 1984. It bore a portrait of Meir on one side and the image of the crowd greeting her in Moscow on the other.[37]"/>
						<outline text="To her close friends, she admitted she had little to do in Moscow and felt isolated from Israeli politics.[27] Despite being a socialist that was born in Ukraine, her Jewish side caused friction with the Soviets that made progress difficult. By the end of her term, she felt she had accomplished little. She reportedly felt guilty for not achieving more for the Russian Jews, as she would have been in their situation if her father had not moved to the United States."/>
						<outline text="She planned to run for the first Knesset elections on 25 January 1949. The month before the elections, she returned to Israel and campaigned for Mapai. Mapai won 35% of the votes and formed a coalition, and Ben-Gurion invited her into the cabinet. She was sworn in on 8 March, and continued to serve in the Knesset until 1974."/>
						<outline text="Labor Minister (1949''1956) Golda Meir and Eva Per&quot;n in Argentina, 1951.Golda Meir at first session of the third government (1951)Ben-Gurion initially offered Meir the position of &quot;deputy prime minister&quot;, which she rejected. She found the title and responsibilities vague, and disliked the idea of needing to coordinate with so many government departments.[27]"/>
						<outline text="Instead, she took the role of Labor Minister, which she held from 10 March 1949 to 19 June 1956.[27] Meir enjoyed this role much more than her previous, calling it her &quot;seven beautiful years&quot;. In particular, she enjoyed the ability to act quickly and with little friction from others. She was also one of the most powerful Israeli politicians at the time."/>
						<outline text="The main source of friction in the role was funding, especially to deal with the millions of immigrants arriving in the new state. In October 1950, Meir announced in Washington a three-year-plan for Israel's development and stated a price tag of $15 billion over the next 15 years. The Israeli government managed to secure a loan from the United States government and American Jews that secured 40% of the budget. The newly-created Israel Bonds only provided a small amount, although years later they would contribute billions to the Israeli economy.[27]"/>
						<outline text="Meir assisted in building over a hundred ma'abarot (Hebrew: ×Ö·×Ö°×Ö¸Ö¼×¨×Ö¹×ª ), temporary immigrant camps with crude tin-roofed huts and tents for housing. She drew criticism from many new immigrants and contemporary politicians due to this, but responded by pointing to her limited budget and the time needed to construct proper housing. In 1953, she assisted in an effort to eliminite the ma'abarot. By 1956, two-thirds were eliminated, and 120,000 families moved to permanent housing.[38][27]"/>
						<outline text="Meir considered herself highly productive during this period.[27] She carried out welfare state policies, orchestrated the integration of immigrants into Israel's workforce,[39] and introduced major housing and road construction projects.[40] From 1949 to 1956, 200,000 apartments and 30,000 houses were built, large industrial and agricultural developments were initiated, and new hospitals, schools, and roads were built.[38] Despite the complaints of her colleagues in the Finance Ministry, Meir worked to establish social security, maternity benefits, work-related accident insurance, benefits to widows and orphans, and even burial costs.[41]"/>
						<outline text="In 1954, she sided with Ben-Gurion against Pinhas Lavon in the Lavon Affair.[27]"/>
						<outline text="In the summer of 1955, Meir reluctantly ran for the position of mayor of Tel Aviv on request of her party. At the time, mayors were elected by the city council and not directly. She lost by the two votes of the religious bloc who withheld their support on the grounds that she was a woman.[42][43] While angered by the sexism she encountered, she was happy to rejoin her colleagues in the cabinet.[27]"/>
						<outline text="On 3 August 1955, she was again hospitalized after complaining of chest pains, and was diagnosed with arrhythmia.[27]"/>
						<outline text="Foreign Minister (1956''1966) Meir with U.S. President John F. Kennedy, 27 December 1962.In October 1955, Ben-Gurion appointed Meir as foreign minister, replacing Sharett. The occasional disagreements between Ben-Gurion and Sharett had escalated to snubbing in meetings and refusals to speak face-to-face. Meir, while less experienced in foreign affairs than Sharett, had a consistently loyal and friendly relationship with Ben-Gurion. While Meir eventually came to enjoy her new job, she disliked the lingering pro-Sharett colleagues in her department.[27]"/>
						<outline text="Meir served as foreign minister from 18 June 1956 to 12 January 1966. Her first months as Foreign Minister coincided with the 1956 Suez Crisis, in which Israel, Britain, and France invaded Egypt to regain Western control over the Suez Canal, remove the President of Egypt Gamal Abdel Nasser, and secure freedom of navigation through the Straits of Tiran for Israel.[44] Meir planned and coordinated with the French government and military prior to the start of the invasion.[45] During United Nations debates about the crisis, Meir took charge of the Israeli delegation.[46] After the fighting started, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Nations forced the three invaders to withdraw."/>
						<outline text="As foreign minister, Meir promoted ties with the newly established states in Africa in an effort to gain allies in the international community.[40] She also believed that Israel had experience in nation-building that could be a model for the Africans. In her autobiography, she wrote:"/>
						<outline text="Like them, we had shaken off foreign rule; like them, we had to learn for ourselves how to reclaim the land, how to increase the yields of our crops, how to irrigate, how to raise poultry, how to live together, and how to defend ourselves. Israel could be a role model because it had been forced to find solutions to the kinds of problems that large, wealthy, powerful states had never encountered.[47]"/>
						<outline text="She also devoted much effort to convincing the United States to sell Israel weaponry. One success in this area came in 1962, when the White House quietly agreed to sell Hawk missiles to Israel.[27] Israel's relationship with the Soviet Union remained frosty during her tenure."/>
						<outline text="On 29 October 1957, Meir's foot was slightly injured when a Mills bomb was thrown into the debating chamber of the Knesset. David Ben-Gurion and Moshe Carmel were more seriously injured. The attack was carried out by 25-year-old Moshe Dwek. Born in Aleppo, his motives were attributed to a dispute with the Jewish Agency, but he was described as being &quot;mentally unbalanced&quot;.[48]"/>
						<outline text="In 1958, Meir praised Pope Pius XII's assistance of the Jewish people shortly after his death. The pontiff's legacy as a wartime pope has continued to be controversial into the 21st century.[49]"/>
						<outline text="The same year, during the wave of Jewish migration from Poland to Israel, Meir sought to prevent disabled and sick Polish Jews from immigrating to Israel. In a letter sent to Israel's ambassador in Warsaw, Katriel Katz, she wrote:"/>
						<outline text="A proposal was raised in the coordination committee to inform the Polish government that we want to institute selection in aliyah, because we cannot continue accepting sick and handicapped people. Please give your opinion as to whether this can be explained to the Poles without hurting immigration.&quot;[50]"/>
						<outline text="In late 1965, 67-year-old Meir was diagnosed with lymphoma.[27] In January 1966, she retired from her role as Foreign Minister, citing exhaustion and ill health, although she continued to serve in the Knesset and as secretary-general of Mapai.[40]"/>
						<outline text="Premiership (1969''1974) PM Golda Meir in Tel Aviv, July, 1969Prime Minister Levi Eshkol died suddenly on 26 February 1969, leading to the appointment of Yigal Allon as interim prime minister and an election to replace him.[51][52] Before the vote, most suspected that Meir would be elected. On 7 March 1969, the party's central committee voted Meir as the new party leader. 71-year-old Meir had mixed feelings, due to her health concerns, but eventually agreed, saying that she would honor the party's decision, just as she had honored all of the party's past decisions.[52][53][54]"/>
						<outline text="Meir served as prime minister from 17 March 1969 to 3 June 1974. She maintained the national unity government formed in 1967 after the Six-Day War, in which Mapai merged with two other parties (Rafi and Ahdut HaAvoda) to form the Israeli Labor Party.[40]"/>
						<outline text="Six months after taking office, Meir led the reconfigured Alignment, comprising Labor and Mapam, into the 1969 general election. The Alignment managed what is still the best showing for a single party or faction in Israeli history, winning 56 seats. This is the only time that a party or faction has approached winning an outright majority in an election. The national unity government was retained."/>
						<outline text="In 1969 and the early 1970s, Meir met with many world leaders to promote her peace settlement idea, including Richard Nixon (1969), Nicolae CeauÈescu (1972) and Pope Paul VI (1973). In 1973, she hosted the chancellor of West Germany, Willy Brandt, in Israel.[40]"/>
						<outline text="In August 1970, Meir accepted a U.S. peace initiative that called for an end to the War of Attrition and an Israeli pledge to withdraw to &quot;secure and recognized boundaries&quot; in the framework of a comprehensive peace settlement. The Gahal party quit the national unity government in protest, but Meir continued to lead the remaining coalition.[55]"/>
						<outline text="On February 28, 1973, during a visit in Washington, D.C., Meir agreed with Henry Kissinger's peace proposal based on &quot;security versus sovereignty&quot;: Israel would accept Egyptian sovereignty over all Sinai, while Egypt would accept Israeli presence in some of Sinai's strategic positions.[56][57][58][59][60]"/>
						<outline text="&quot;There was no such thing as Palestinians&quot; In June 1969, on the two-year anniversary of the Six-Day War, Meir stated in an interview that there was no such thing as Palestinians, a comment later described by Al Jazeera as &quot;one of her defining '' and most damning '' legacies.&quot;[61] [62] This phrase is considered to be the most famous example of Israeli denial of Palestinian identity.[63]"/>
						<outline text="The interview entitled Who can blame Israel was published in The Sunday Times on June 15, 1969, and included the following exchange:"/>
						<outline text="Frank Giles: Do you think the emergence of the Palestinian fighting forces, the Fedayeen, is an important new factor in the Middle East?Golda Meir: Important, no. A new factor, yes. There was no such thing as Palestinians. When was there an independent Palestinian people with a Palestinian state? It was either southern Syria before the First World War and then it was a Palestine including Jordan. It was not as though there was a Palestinian people in Palestine considering itself as a Palestinian people and we came and threw them out and took their country from them. They did not exist.[64] Munich Olympics (1972) Meir (center) with Pat and President Richard Nixon in Washington, DC, in 1973.In the wake of the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics, Meir appealed to the world to &quot;save our citizens and condemn the unspeakable criminal acts committed&quot;.[65] Outraged at the perceived lack of global action, she ordered the Mossad to hunt down and assassinate suspected leaders and operatives of Black September and the PFLP.[66]"/>
						<outline text="Dispute with Austria (1973) During the 1970s, about 200,000 Soviet Jewish emigrants were allowed to leave the Soviet Union for Israel by way of Austria. When seven of these emigrants were taken hostage at the Austria''Czechoslovakia border by Palestinian militants in September 1973, the Chancellor of Austria, Bruno Kreisky, closed the Jewish Agency's transit facility in Sch¶nau, Austria. A few days later in Vienna, Meir tried to convince Kreisky to reopen the facility by appealing to his own Jewish origin, and described his position as &quot;succumbing to terrorist blackmail&quot;. Kreisky did not change his position, so Meir returned to Israel, infuriated. A few months later, Austria opened a new transition camp.[68]"/>
						<outline text="Yom Kippur War (1973) US President Richard Nixon and Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir meeting on March 1, 1973, in the Oval Office. Nixon's National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger is to the right of Nixon.A common criticism of Meir is that she could have avoided the Yom Kippur War in 1973. For months preceding the attack, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat made repeated overtures for peace in exchange for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai, but these gestures were rebuffed by Meir, who had offered previously to discuss ceding &quot;most of the Sinai&quot;, but was not willing to restore the pre-1967 borders, and Egypt had no interest in peace talks under Meir's conditions.[6] As the nation's leader during this short war, her main goal was deciding on the timing of preliminary operations, and providing the IDF with the necessary time and munitions to pull off a victory.[69]"/>
						<outline text="In the days leading up to the Yom Kippur War, Israeli intelligence could not conclusively determine that an attack was imminent. However, on 5 October 1973, Meir received information that Syrian forces were massing on the Golan Heights. She was alarmed by the reports, and believed that the situation was similar to what preceded the Six-Day War. However, her advisers counseled her not to worry, saying they would have adequate notice before any war broke out. This made sense at the time; after the Six Day War, most in the Israeli intelligence community considered the Arabs unprepared to launch another attack.[70] Consequently, although the Knesset passed a resolution granting her power to demand a full-scale call-up of the military (instead of the typical cabinet decision), Meir did not mobilize Israel's forces early. Soon, though, the threat of war became very clear. Six hours before the outbreak of hostilities, Meir met with Minister of Defense Moshe Dayan and General David Elazar. While Dayan continued to argue that war was unlikely and favored calling up the air force and only two divisions, Elazar advocated full-scale army mobilization and the launch of a full-scale preemptive strike on Syrian forces.[71]"/>
						<outline text="On October 6, Meir approved full-scale mobilizing but rejected a preemptive strike, citing concerns that Israel might be perceived as initiating hostilities, which would hurt Israel's access to crucial foreign aid and military support, in particular from the United States, in the resulting conflict. She made it a priority to inform Washington of her decision. U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger later confirmed Meir's assessment by stating that if Israel had launched a preemptive strike, Israel would not have received the backing of the United States.[72][73]"/>
						<outline text="Resignation (1974) Golda Meir Memorial Plaque on the building where she was born (5-A Baseina Street, Kyiv)Following the Yom Kippur War, Meir's government was plagued by infighting and questions over Israel's lack of preparation for the war. The Agranat Commission appointed to investigate the war cleared Meir of &quot;direct responsibility&quot;. It said about her actions on Yom Kippur morning:"/>
						<outline text="She decided wisely, with common sense and speedily, in favour of the full mobilization of the reserves, as recommended by the chief-of-staff, despite weighty political considerations, thereby performing a most important service for the defence of the state.[72]"/>
						<outline text="Her party won the elections in December 1973, but the coalition lost seats and was unable to form a majority. Meir resigned as prime minister on 11 April 1974, and gave up her Knesset seat on 7 June 1974. She never held office again. She believed that was the &quot;will of the people&quot; and that she had served enough time as premier. She believed the government needed to form a coalition. She said, &quot;Five years are sufficient  ... It is beyond my strength to continue carrying this burden.&quot;[72][74] Yitzhak Rabin succeeded her on June 3, 1974."/>
						<outline text="After premiereship and death (1974''1978) In 1975, Meir published her autobiography, My Life, which became a New York Times Best Seller.[72][75]"/>
						<outline text="On 21 November 1977, Meir spoke at the Knesset on behalf of the Labor Party to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat during his historic trip as the first Arab leader to visit Israel. She said his visit was important for the sake of the next generations' avoiding war, praised Sadat for his courage and vision, and expressed the hope that while many differences remained to be resolved, that vision would be achieved in a spirit of mutual understanding.[76][77]"/>
						<outline text="On 8 December 1978, Meir died of lymphatic cancer (lymphoma) in Jerusalem at the age of 80. She was buried on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.[78][79]"/>

Despite never divorcing, the couple grew apart over the course of the marriage.[18] When Meir took her children with her to the United States in the 1930s, Morris stayed behind in Jerusalem."/>
						<outline text="Meir had two children.[21] Her son, Menachem, was born on 1924 in Jerusalem and died on 14 December 2014 in Tel Aviv.

						<outline text="She was a heavy smoker and coffee drinker, and did not exercise often, which may have contributed to her recurring heart problems.[27]"/>
						<outline text="Of her Jewish identity, Meir said in the 1975 edition of her autobiography My Life that:"/>
						<outline text="It is not only a matter, I believe, of religious observance and practice. To me, being Jewish means and has always meant being proud to be part of a people that has maintained its distinct identity for more than 2,000 years, with all the pain and torment that has been inflicted upon it.[82]"/>
						<outline text="She strongly identified with Judaism culturally, but was an atheist in religious belief.[83][84][85] She is famously reported to have stated: &quot;I believe in the Jewish people, and the Jewish people believe in God.&quot;[86]"/>
						<outline text="Awards and recognition In 1974, Meir was awarded the honor of World Mother by American Mothers.[87]In 1974 Meir was awarded the James Madison Award for Distinguished Public Service by Princeton University's American Whig''Cliosophic Society.[88]"/>

						<outline text="In 1985, Meir was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame.[90]"/>
						<outline text="Legacy Biographer Meron Medzini argues that a perspective of forty years makes possible an appreciation of her deep nationalism and Zionism. Historians find her main legacy includes effective leadership of the Labor Movement, and building good relationships with Third World nations. Medzini states, &quot;Apart from laying the foundations for Israel's presence in Africa, she was never taken with the routine and often dull diplomatic work in the Foreign Ministry and abhorred its outer manifestations of ceremonies and rites.&quot;[91] Most historians agree she was a success as Secretary of Labor and Housing, but a failure as prime minister.[7]"/>
						<outline text="A controversial figure in Israel, she has been lionized as a founder of the state and described as the &quot;Iron Lady&quot; of Israeli politics, but also widely blamed for the country being caught by surprise during the 1973 Yom Kippur War.

Actress Colleen Dewhurst portrayed Meir in the 1986 TV movie Sword of Gideon.[92]"/>
						<outline text="In 2003, American Jewish actress Tovah Feldshuh portrayed her on Broadway in Golda's Balcony, Gibson's second play about Meir's life. The play was controversial for implying that Meir considered using nuclear weapons during the Yom Kippur War.[citation needed ] Valerie Harper portrayed Meir in the touring company production and in the film version of Golda's Balcony.[93] In 2005, actress Lynn Cohen portrayed Meir in Steven Spielberg's film Munich."/>

						<outline text="A statement from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) about semaglutide and, more generally, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists recently caused a stir. Could these medicines lead to patients taking their own lives?"/>
						<outline text="Medical Authorities Alert The EMA published a press release in early July 2023 to announce that a review is underway after reports from the Icelandic Medicines Agency about two cases of patients who developed suicidal thoughts while taking liraglutide (Saxenda) and semaglutide (Ozempic). There was also a report of self-injury in a patient taking liraglutide."/>
						<outline text="Clearly, a few cases aren't enough to call an entire therapeutic class into question or to establish contraindications. Further investigation is needed, and the European authorities who collected the data are analyzing the approximately 150 reports concerning possible cases of self-injury and suicidal thoughts in patients taking these drugs. We should have some results and answers by November 2023."/>
						<outline text="This alert comes at a time when GLP-1 agonists, especially semaglutide, are being misused, particularly in France. The French health authorities (ANSM) have published a press release and reiterated that these medicinal products should be used only as indicated."/>
						<outline text="Despite these warnings, alerts, and suspicions, the risk profile of GLP-1 agonists appears to clinicians to be very good. Although nausea and vomiting occasionally lead patients to stop treatment, there are no obvious major side effects. A risk for acute pancreatitis (though not yet fully confirmed) has been mentioned, as has a risk for thyroid cancer that has not fully been proven in humans. Do we now have to worry about suicide risk?"/>
						<outline text="Another Rimonabant Fiasco? This situation is reminiscent of what happened with rimonabant (Acomplia), which was studied and marketed in the early 2000s. Relatively soon after it reached the market, it was withdrawn, mainly because of a risk for depression and suicide. Is this a case of history repeating itself? Have we found ourselves in the same situation? Frankly, as it stands, I don't think so."/>
						<outline text="It's true that with rimonabant, we had some worrying data that had already been observed in randomized clinical trials. There were already signs of mood disturbances in patients taking the drug vs placebo. With GLP-1 agonists, to my knowledge, there have been no reports of this kind in the clinical trials conducted. Of course, this doesn't rule out a rare risk. That's why we need to continue with the investigations."/>
						<outline text="We also know that there are GLP-1 receptors in the central nervous system. We often talk about them as being located in the hypothalamus, which largely explains the effect of these drugs on appetite. But the mechanisms of action of GLP-1 agonists and medicines conventionally used to reduce appetite (anorectics or even rimonabant) are very different. This is why we don't really expect there to be any psychological side effects with GLP-1 agonists."/>
						<outline text="What's the Explanation? Why do we have these suspicious observations of suicidal ideation or self-injury? What are the possible explanations?"/>
						<outline text="In my opinion, we must first confirm that the incidence of these psychiatric disturbances is greater in patients taking GLP-1 agonists than in a similar matched general population group. We should also question whether these mood disturbances are not simply linked to patients with obesity who have easy access to GLP-1 agonists. We know that obesity is associated with an increased risk for suicidal ideation and self-injury."/>
						<outline text="There is another little-known observation: Weight loss is associated with a risk for suicide. It has been spoken about in relation to bariatric surgery. We know that after bariatric surgery (bypass or sleeve gastrectomy) the risk for suicidal ideation is double that of the preoperative period in the same population. And this risk is multiplied by close to four when comparing the population with a control group. But be careful because these data come from observational studies. Although the analysis I'm referring to when I'm speaking in relation to a control population is a control group, it isn't from a randomized trial."/>
						<outline text="There is another interesting piece of data, which is that weight loss, regardless of the method used, is associated with an increased risk for suicide. This is what I found in two prospective studies involving this association, and there is no obvious explanation for it at this stage. Of course, there are lots of types of methodologic bias possible, but this poses the question of why there is a greater risk for suicide and self-injury in people taking a certain treatment and losing weight."/>
						<outline text="In Practice Should we change our attitude towards prescribing GLP-1 agonists? For the moment, there are no recommendations in this regard. I don't think that it's reasonable to upend everything. Of course, the important thing is to adhere strictly to the treatment indications, and in a few weeks' time, we'll see the results from the analyses conducted by the French Health Authorities regarding the causal link between suicide risk and taking a GLP-1 agonist."/>
						<outline text="With our current knowledge, I think we can all agree that losing weight is never a walk in the park. It's a change, for which individual physical and psychological consequences must be measured."/>

						<outline text="The case in favor of homeschooling is growing by the day.  Multiple public school districts in the state of Wisconsin officially added gender fluid ideology as a part if their controversial &quot;Human Growth and Development&quot; curriculum that earned heat from critics in 2022.  While Wisconsin allows districts to tailor their own sex education programs and not all districts are the same, basic lessons in many districts include teaching &quot;gender role stereotypes&quot; to second graders, third graders are urged to investigate their gender identity and sixth graders are instructed to refer to girls as &quot;a person with a vulva.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="For 4th and 5th graders in the Superior School District of Wisconsin, the 2023-2024 required resource list includes a cartoon produced by the Canadian Public Broadcasting Service (CBC) called 'Gender Explained.'  This is what they are now teaching to 9-year-olds in WI:"/>
						<outline text="Below is the the portion of the Superior District required curriculum resources list that includes the CBC cartoon:"/>
						<outline text="Gender ideology was initially taught covertly to children by activist teachers across the US, with teacher unions and organizations quietly encouraging the practice while also pushing for secrecy from parents.  Progressives denied the practice for years, claiming that accusations were &quot;paranoia and conspiracy theory&quot; despite ample evidence to the contrary, including teacher's own confessions on social media. "/>
						<outline text="After exposure became widespread and parents realized that their children were being indoctrinated into the far-left fold instead of being taught reading, writing and arithmetic, the uproar did not lead to a change in momentum or an apology from schools.  Rather, Democrat states and school districts doubled down, admitted that they were teaching gender fluidity to kids and started officially adding the lessons to the curriculum.  This has been the case in Wisconsin."/>
						<outline text="Gender identity started as a fringe movement attached to LGBT organizations, but it has quickly mutated into a sweeping sociopolitical movement with the help of the entertainment industry, social media, corporate propaganda and most of all, public school teachers.  Studies show a huge spike in trans identifying children from 2017-2021, right as gender curriculum was being secretly introduced in classrooms. "/>
						<outline text="Trends among young people often die as quickly as they are adopted; the problem is that schools and government organizations are institutionalizing the trans fantasy as if it is proven science."/>
						<outline text="Keep in mind, there is no concrete scientific evidence supporting the notion that &quot;gender&quot; exists separate from biological sex, or that gender identity is fluid outside of an extremely rare mental illness known as gender dysphoria.  In fact, trans activists have organized in an attempt to have studies disproving gender theory removed from major scientific journals. "/>
						<outline text="For example, in March, activists were able to force a retraction on technical grounds of a paper on gender dysphoria by one of the world's largest academic publishers, Springer Nature, which publishes Nature magazine and Scientific American.  The paper found a large number of parents of gender dysphoric children said that their children suffered from long standing preexisting mental health issues.  The study also reported a large number of parents surveyed thought their children's gender dysphoria resulted from social contagion.  In other words, kids are jumping on the bandwagon because it is seen as trendy, or because they are being brainwashed.      "/>

						<outline text="Amaryllis Hope Fox (born Amaryllis Damerell Thornber; September 22, 1980)[1][2] is an American writer, television host, public speaker, and former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer. She departed from her role at the CIA in 2010.[3] Subsequently, Fox authored a memoir about her time in the CIA, entitled Life Undercover: Coming of Age in the CIA, published by Knopf Doubleday in October 2019.[4] She is the host of the six-episode Netflix documentary series The Business of Drugs, released in July 2020.[5]"/>
						<outline text="Early life and education         Edit  Fox was born Amaryllis Damerell Thornber in New York City. Her mother, Lalage Damerell, is an English retired actress.[6] Her father was an economist. Fox's mother has since married billionaire businessman Steven Rales.[1] When Fox was eight years old, she suffered the loss of her friend Laura in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.[7] She said of the event in an interview with the CBC News, &quot;I remember being very, very overwhelmed by the loss and my dad intervened and said, you have to understand the forces that took her or they will drown you.&quot;[7] Fox describes the moment as pivotal for catalyzing increased awareness of current events and geopolitical conditions.[7]"/>
						<outline text="Growing up in Washington, D.C. and London, Fox attended the National Cathedral School beginning in eighth grade and graduated in 1998; she attended The American School in London during tenth grade.[8] She completed undergraduate studies at the University of Oxford in 2002.[9] Fox stated that while at Oxford, she rebuffed approaches from the Secret Intelligence Service.[7][9] Prior to Fox's final year at Oxford, the September 11 attacks took place while she was visiting family in Washington, D.C.; subsequently, she decided to pursue a master's degree in conflict and terrorism at the Walsh School of Foreign Service.[10] For her master's thesis, Fox developed an algorithm intended to identify local terrorist safe havens, which attracted attention from the CIA.[10]"/>
						<outline text="Career         Edit  Interview with Aung Sang Suu Kyi         Edit  In 1999, at age 18, Fox clandestinely recorded an interview for the BBC with the Burmese leader Aung Sang Suu Kyi, then under house arrest. To arrange the meeting, Fox worked with a local dissident journalist with whom she communicated via taped messages inside the water tank of a toilet at a caf(C) in Rangoon.[9] Her intent in the trip had been to make a secret recording of planned pro-democracy protests on September 9.[11] A book, called &quot;In the Quiet Land&quot; was set to be published in 2002, with film rights optioned to Golden Square Pictures and screenplay by Nick Thomas.[11]"/>
						<outline text="Central Intelligence Agency         Edit  Fox became one of the youngest female officers in the CIA at the age of 22, assigned to &quot;non-official cover,&quot; entailing living abroad with a fake identity and no diplomatic protections.[12] Fox states her work focused on preventing terror organizations from acquiring weapons of mass destruction, assuming the cover of an art dealer.[3] After eight years at the agency, Fox left the CIA in 2010.[3]"/>
						<outline text="Memoir and controversy         Edit  Fox's memoir, entitled Life Undercover: Coming of Age in the CIA described her experiences as an officer. Prior to the book's release, numerous journalists and former CIA officers pointed out that her memoir's manuscript had been submitted to publisher Knopf Doubleday without first receiving approval from the CIA's Publication Review Board, a potential violation of nondisclosure agreements signed by CIA staff.[4] Fox was represented in that process by attorney Mark Zaid.[13] Some former CIA case officers have expressed skepticism about elements of Fox's accounts of events or raised questions regarding the circumvention of the CIA's lengthy approval process.[4] Fox responded by stating that she had taken care not to reveal potentially sensitive details, and that some characters were composites.[4]"/>
						<outline text="Television and public speaking         Edit  Fox is the host of the Netflix documentary series The Business of Drugs, for which she traveled to several countries while in the third trimester of pregnancy.[3] The show investigates the supply chains, social effects, and legal issues specific to six types of drugs: cocaine, synthetics, heroin, meth, opioids, and cannabis.[14] She speaks at events around the world on dialogue and peacekeeping.[9] Apple is reportedly developing a TV series based on Fox's memoir that will star American actress Brie Larson, with Fox serving as an executive producer on the series.[10]"/>
						<outline text="Personal life         Edit  Fox's first marriage was to a British man named Anthony, which was annulled.[10] She has a daughter named Zo with her second husband, Dean Fox, a CIA officer who had previously served in Afghanistan. Before their divorce, she lived undercover with him in Shanghai.[4][10] Fox is currently married to Robert F. Kennedy III, a grandson of Robert F. Kennedy. The couple has a daughter named Bobby and a son named Cassius.[15][16] Fox and Kennedy were introduced via a mutual friend at Burning Man, and married in Cape Cod in 2018.[10]"/>

						<outline text="The environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist significantly added to his campaign trail schedule this summer and early fall, making stops in New Hampshire and South Carolina in addition to general election swing states. The campaign also opened field offices in New Hampshire and South Carolina as well as a campaign headquarters in New Jersey."/>
						<outline text="The single biggest expense over the last quarter was more than $916,000 for security services paid to the firm of Gavin de Becker, a security specialist who also gave $4.5 million to a super PAC backing Kennedy's candidacy earlier this year."/>
						<outline text="In July, the Kennedy's campaign asked for secret service protection. But Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas determined that providing security was ''not warranted at this time.'' Most presidential candidates do not receive secret service protection during a primary."/>
						<outline text="The request and subsequent private security expense come after numerous comments Kennedy has made around the political assassinations in his own family. In a cable news appearance earlier this year, Kennedy claimed that the CIA was involved in killing his uncle, President John F. Kennedy."/>
						<outline text="The campaign also reported spending more than $260,000 on travel and also purchased a campaign vehicle from Land and Sea Specialty, an RV dealer in Florida, for almost $200,000."/>
						<outline text="Kennedy also continued a series of documentary-style videos, including one focused on a trip to the U.S.-Mexico border, and increased his digital media presence during the reporting period, and the campaign said it spent $218,000 on media production expenses across several different vendors."/>
						<outline text="And nearly $180,000 went to the consulting company of former congressman Dennis Kucinich, who had served as Kennedy's campaign manager since the spring. Kennedy's campaign announced on Friday that Amaryllis Kennedy, his daughter-in-law and a former undercover CIA agent, would be taking over as campaign manager."/>
						<outline text="''He is now handing off the baton to the team he did so much to cultivate,'' Kennedy said in a statement. ''Amaryllis is a woman of extraordinary intelligence and drive who I am confident will take this campaign to the next level.''"/>
						<outline text="Amaryllis Kennedy has been with the campaign since the spring and was the highest-paid campaign staffer in the third quarter, making $49,000. The Kennedy campaign spent $720,000 in total staff salaries from July through September."/>
						<outline text="More than two-thirds of Kennedy's third-quarter fundraising came from donors who gave at least $200. Just over $3 million came from donors who have given at least $3,300 to his campaign, while $2.7 million came from small-dollar donors who gave less than $200 apiece."/>
						<outline text="Kennedy relaunched his campaign for president earlier this week as an independent candidate, quitting the party that his family helped define in the 20th century."/>
						<outline text="That Oct. 9 announcement occurred after this reporting period and would not have impacted his third quarter fundraising. But it will be reflected in the next reporting period deadline at the end of January."/>

						<outline text="WISHFUL THINKING: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses world leaders during the United Nations General Assembly last month in New York City. / Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images. Decades ago I spent three years writing  The Samson Option  (1991), an expos(C) of the unstated policy of American presidents going back to Dwight Eisenhower to look the other way as Israel began the process of building an atomic bomb. The right or wrong for Israel, in the aftermath of the Holocaust, was not the point of the book. My point was that what America was doing was known throughout the Third World, as it was then called, and our duplicity made our worries about the spread of nuclear weapons another example of American hypocrisy. Since then others have undertaken far more comprehensive studies, as some of the most highly classified Israeli and US documents have become public."/>

But I found Israelis living abroad who had worked on the secret project and were willing to talk to me once I indicated I had information from American intelligence files.

They have also remained in close touch with former colleagues who stayed in Israel."/>

						<outline text="This week, two stories came out that placed the left's anti-government riots in a new light."/>
						<outline text="First, in a podcast with Haaretz reporter Amir Oren, Gilead Sher'--one of the leaders of the ''Resistance'' against the Netanyahu government'--explained that he and his colleagues put together the organizational and financial structure for the mass rioting that Israel has experienced since January, before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his colleagues formed the government. In other words, the riots, protests, acts of political violence and intimidation that have swamped Israel since January were not spontaneous responses to the government's legal reform proposals. They were planned and financed weeks before Justice Minister Yariv Levin was appointed to his position and well before the government took any position on anything."/>
						<outline text="Sher served as Ehud Barak's chief of staff during Barak's brief tenure as prime minister from 1999-2001. He was Barak's chief negotiator with the PLO at the failed Camp David Peace Summit and has remained close to Barak ever since."/>
						<outline text="Speaking to Oren, Sher revealed that the plot to light the country on fire was hatched in mid-December, three weeks before the government was formed. In a meeting hosted by Yossi Kutchik, who served as the director general of the Prime Minister's Office during Barak's premiership, Sher and Kutchik met with former IDF Chief of General Staff Dan Halutz and high-tech billionaire and far-left political activist Orni Petruschka."/>
						<outline text="In Sher's telling, ''The four of us met and very quickly, maybe a week or two, we were joined by a number of other people.''"/>
						<outline text="Among others, Sher mentioned former deputy attorney general Dina Zilber and Shikma Bressler. In 2020, Bressler burst into the public consciousness as head of the ''Black Flags'' group of anti-Netanyahu protesters. As Israel's Channel 13 revealed in January 2020, Bressler's group was funded by Ehud Barak."/>
						<outline text="Barele Crombly, who organized several of the right's major pro-judicial reform protests, claimed in a recent interview that Barak is one of the largest funders of the ''Resistance.'' Crombly claimed that ''Ehud Barak is funding the protest with millions if not tens of millions of shekels.''"/>
						<outline text="Sher's claims were later expanded by former leftist activist Eldad Yaniv. Yaniv, who was a senior adviser to Barak during his 1999 campaign against Netanyahu and maintained close ties to the former premier in the intervening years, organized the 2017 protests outside then-Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit's home demanding that he indict Netanyahu. After the Nov. 1 elections, Yaniv broke with his political colleagues because he felt that the public had spoken and that Netanyahu and his government had the right to lead the country."/>
						<outline text="After Sher gave his interview, Yaniv explained on Channel 11 said that the same people Sher mentioned in his interview approached him before the elections. Convinced by their polling data that Netanyahu and the religious right would win the elections, they asked Yaniv to begin planning the campaign Sher claims he initiated last December."/>
						<outline text="The first thing that we learn from these revelations again is that the impetus for the protests and direct actions against Netanyahu, his government and the majority of the Israeli public that voted for Netanyahu's government was not the government's judicial reform agenda, nor any other policy the government has launched. Rather, the protests were a preconceived program to paralyze and destabilize the government with the plan to overthrow it. The anti-judicial reform banner was attached to the protests because it was the new government's first major initiative."/>
						<outline text="The other aspect that is notable is the apparent centrality of Ehud Barak in everything that has happened. "/>
						<outline text="Barak has been one of the most outspoken and radical critics of Netanyahu and his government. And now we learn that while he wasn't present at the meeting Sher described, Sher and Kutchik'--like many of the dozens of retired generals, colonels and high-tech tycoons running the protest and riot campaigns'--are closely associated with Barak. These are the people who initiated the hi-tech sector's anti-government campaign and who organized retired generals to take a leading role in calling for active duty reservists to refuse to serve in reserves."/>
						<outline text="'Deliberately destroying' an industry to placate Washington"/>
						<outline text="The second major story this week was an expose by the Financial Times regarding Israeli cyber security firm Paragon. Barak sits on the firm's board of directors."/>
						<outline text="Israel was arguably the first country to recognize the centrality of cyber security for 21st-century intelligence operations. In recent decades, former soldiers and officers from the IDF's cyber intelligence unit 8200 formed private companies that developed cyber espionage tools used by Israel's intelligence agencies, and, under the strict supervision of the Defense Ministry, exported those tools to friendly nations. Cyber tools are vital to today's counterterror operations. Untold numbers of lives in Israel and around the world have been saved through the penetration of the electronic communications of terrorists."/>
						<outline text="Beginning in 2018, an NGO called Citizen Lab which operates out of the University of Toronto began publishing a series of reports claiming that one Israeli cyber firm, NSO Group, was being used by authoritarian regimes to harm journalists and human-rights activists. That report, together with several follow-up reports with additional allegations, most of which were debunked, formed the basis of the Biden administration's decision in November 2021 to blacklist NSO Group and Candiru, another Israeli cybersecurity firm. Notably, The New York Times reported last year that days after the United States blacklisted NSO Group, it signed a secret contract with the group to purchase NSO's geolocation tool that can covertly track mobile phones around the world without the owner's knowledge."/>
						<outline text="Last July, two weeks after the Bennett-Lapid-Gantz government lost its parliamentary majority and new elections were called, Channel 13's military correspondent Alon Ben David reported that the Biden administration and the U.S. intelligence agencies had decided to destroy Israel's cybersecurity industry and force Israel's cybersecurity firms to transfer their ownership, operations'--and allegiance'--to the United States."/>
						<outline text="The Bennett-Lapid-Gantz government was beholden to the Biden administration as no previous Israeli government had ever felt beholden to any U.S. administration. Rather than defend Israel's industry, according to Ben David, the government was ''deliberately destroying'' the industry to placate Washington. ''The Defense Ministry has already frozen most of the export licenses and the Americans have simply decided to shut down our offensive cyber industry and transfer it to them,'' Ben David explained."/>
						<outline text="The heads of Israel's intelligence agencies were up in arms. They told Ben David that shuttering the industry would cause massive harm to Israel's capacity to defend itself. But in short order, Israel's cybersecurity firms folded, sold their shares or closed their offensive cyber divisions."/>
						<outline text="Not all Israeli firms were upset about what was happening. As Ben David put it: ''Unfortunately, there were Israeli companies that, in their greed for sales, gave the Americans the excuse to act.''"/>
						<outline text="Ben David didn't provide any details about which Israeli firms were benefiting from the U.S.'s bare-knuckled assault on Israel's cyber industry. This week, the Financial Times appears to have provided the backstory. According to a news report, as Citizen Lab was going after NSO Group, NSO Group's competitor with a cyber weapon of its own called Graphite, decided to take advantage of the situation. The competitor's name was Paragon."/>
						<outline text="According to the report, ''In 2019, even before work on Graphite had been completed'..., Paragon hired DC-based WestExec Advisors, the influential advisory group staffed by ex-Obama White House officials including Michele Flournoy, Avril Haines and Antony Blinken. Ex-U.S. ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, was also consulted.''"/>
						<outline text="After Biden's election, Haines was appointed director of national intelligence and Blinken became secretary of state."/>
						<outline text="The Financial Times' report continues, ''WestExec said it 'advised Paragon on its strategic approach to the U.S. and European markets, as well as the formulation of its industry-leading ethical commitments designed to ensure the appropriate use of its technology.'''"/>
						<outline text="The report explained, ''American approval, even if indirect, has been at the heart of Paragon's strategy. The company sought a list of allied nations that the US wouldn't object to seeing deploy Graphite.''"/>
						<outline text="Last year, Paragon won a contract to provide cyber security tools to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. As the Financial Times' story explains, while Paragon built its marketing strategy on subordinating its activities to U.S. approval, NSO Group worked with the government of Israel which provided it with export licenses to countries that Israel wished to assist. Israel's cybersecurity prowess is one of the foundations of its strategic ties with Saudi Arabia and other Arab states. And as Ben David hinted, the sale of NSO's Pegasus spyware to these countries was one of the reasons that the Abraham Accords were achieved."/>
						<outline text="Barak's position in the United States is strong but precarious. On the one hand, he enjoys close relations with senior U.S. political and national security officials. On the other hand, Barak's name has come up as one of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's associates. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that according to Epstein's diary, Epstein met Barak 30 times between 2013 and 2017. Barak also flew several times with Epstein on Epstein's private jet. Epstein was convicted of child sex solicitation in 2009."/>
						<outline text="Barak told the Journal that his wife and security detail accompanied him on all of his flights."/>
						<outline text="In 2020, court documents revealed that in a sworn deposition, Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre claimed that Epstein forced her to have sex with Barak. Barak flatly rejected the allegation, and others have challenged Giuffre's credibility."/>
						<outline text="In July 2019, while Epstein was jailed in Manhattan pending trial on child sex trafficking charges, the Daily Mail published a photo of Barak taken in January 2016. The photograph showed Barak wearing a facemask and standing outside Epstein's New York townhouse. In the four hours that followed, four young women were photographed entering Epstein's home."/>
						<outline text="Barak admitted that it was him in the photograph but insisted that his meeting that day with Epstein was innocent. ''I was there for lunch or a chat, nothing else. So what? I never attended a party with him. I never met Epstein in the company of women or young girls.'' Barak said in a comment to The Daily Beast. Barak also admitted to flying on Epstein's plane to his island residence in the Caribbean where Epstein allegedly held illicit sex parties with underage girls."/>
						<outline text="Also in July 2019, Haaretz reported that in 2015, Epstein invested millions of dollars in Barak's company Carbyne, which develops geolocation software for emergency services."/>
						<outline text="Several men whose names were associated with Epstein, including Prince Andrew, and senior Morgan Stanley executive Jes Staley were forced to resign their positions and withdraw from public life. Barak's close ties to Epstein, in contrast, have been downplayed by the Israeli media and ignored by the state prosecution. Obviously, the situation would change immediately if U.S. officials decided to investigate Barak's close ties to Epstein."/>
						<outline text="Barak's Twitter feed is filled with enraged, threatening posts against Netanyahu and his coalition partners. In recent weeks, it has focused its ire at opposition leaders Yair Lapid and Benny Gantz, whom Barak has been trying to intimidate into rejecting all efforts to negotiate an agreed program for judicial reform with the government, under the auspices of President Isaac Herzog."/>
						<outline text="It is impossible to know whether Barak's ties with senior U.S. officials are related to his multiyear efforts to oust Netanyahu from power. But from this week's revelations we learned that Barak's associates organized the continuous campaign to destabilize and paralyze the Netanyahu government, and that they began their efforts before the government was formed. We also learned that Barak benefited personally from the U.S. move to seize Israel's cybertechnology industry."/>
						<outline text="Beyond that, we know that Netanyahu is the Israeli leader who transformed Israel into an independent, regional power and did so despite the fervent opposition of Barak, his associates and key members of the Biden administration."/>

						<outline text="     By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:       Section   1 .   Policy .  Technology is central to the future of our national security, economy, and democracy.  The United States has fundamental national security and foreign policy interests in (1) ensuring that technology is developed, deployed, and governed in accordance with universal human rights; the rule of law; and appropriate legal authorization, safeguards, and oversight, such that it supports, and does not undermine, democracy, civil rights and civil liberties, and public safety; and (2) mitigating, to the greatest extent possible, the risk emerging technologies may pose to United States Government institutions, personnel, information, and information systems."/>
						<outline text="     To advance these interests, the United States supports the development of an international technology ecosystem that protects the integrity of international standards development; enables and promotes the free flow of data and ideas with trust; protects our security, privacy, and human rights; and enhances our economic competitiveness.  The growing exploitation of Americans' sensitive data and improper use of surveillance technology, including commercial spyware, threatens the development of this ecosystem.  Foreign governments and persons have deployed commercial spyware against United States Government institutions, personnel, information, and information systems, presenting significant counterintelligence and security risks to the United States Government.  Foreign governments and persons have also used commercial spyware for improper purposes, such as to target and intimidate perceived opponents; curb dissent; limit freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, or association; enable other human rights abuses or suppression of civil liberties; and track or target United States persons without proper legal authorization, safeguards, or oversight. "/>
						<outline text="     The United States has a fundamental national security and foreign policy interest in countering and preventing the proliferation of commercial spyware that has been or risks being misused for such purposes, in light of the core interests of the United States in protecting United States Government personnel and United States citizens around the world; upholding and advancing democracy; promoting respect for human rights; and defending activists, dissidents, and journalists against threats to their freedom and dignity.  To advance these interests and promote responsible use of commercial spyware, the United States must establish robust protections and procedures to ensure that any United States Government use of commercial spyware helps protect its information systems and intelligence and law enforcement activities against significant counterintelligence or security risks; aligns with its core interests in promoting democracy and democratic values around the world; and ensures that the United States Government does not contribute, directly or indirectly, to the proliferation of commercial spyware that has been misused by foreign governments or facilitate such misuse."/>
						<outline text="     Therefore, I hereby establish as the policy of the United States Government that it shall not make operational use of commercial spyware that poses significant counterintelligence or security risks to the United States Government or significant risks of improper use by a foreign government or foreign person.  In furtherance of the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States, this order accordingly directs steps to implement that policy and protect the safety and security of United States Government institutions, personnel, information, and information systems; discourage the improper use of commercial spyware; and encourage the development and implementation of responsible norms regarding the use of commercial spyware that are consistent with respect for the rule of law, human rights, and democratic norms and values.  The actions directed in this order are consistent with the policy objectives set forth in section 6318 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (NDAA FY 2023) (Public Law 117-263) and section 5502 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (NDAA FY 2022) (Public Law 117-81).

						<outline text="Fri, 13 Oct 2023 23:29"/>
						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="A new investigation by The Washington Post and a consortium of 16 international news outlets reveals that software from an Israeli company named NSO Group has spied on hundreds of journalists, activists, executives, and government officials. Its infamous product Pegasus can crack into encrypted phones without a trace and is used by autocrats. The findings are part of the Pegasus Project, which has already presented evidence of the spyware being used to hack the slain Mexican journalist Cecilio Pineda Birto as well as two people close to the journalist Jamal Khashoggi."/>
						<outline text="But NSO Group has been deflecting from its relationship with authoritarian governments for years. After its surveillance tech was caught being used to target dissidents, the notorious Israeli company sought the assistance of WestExec Advisors, the consultancy founded by now''Secretary of State Tony Blinken and staffed by prominent national-security experts from the Obama administration."/>
						<outline text="More from Jonathan Guyer"/>
						<outline text="WestExec turned the company down, but NSO was persistent. It was investing heavily in a revamp of its global reputation in response to accusations of its spyware's abuse, especially in the hands of Saudi Arabia. NSO must have sensed just how influential Blinken's tight-knit group of former policymakers was, though the client didn't align with WestExec's stated principles."/>
						<outline text="The consulting group stood firm, but NSO had actually already recruited one of its members. Dan Shapiro, a WestExec consultant based in Israel and Obama's former ambassador to the country, had already been working for NSO."/>
						<outline text="Shapiro began independently advising NSO in mid-2017, months before WestExec was established. He counseled NSO on how to prevent the misuse of its technology and advised the company to stop selling its hacking tools to Saudi Arabia, according to The New York Times. Initially, NSO heeded. But then, under new ownership'--and with the encouragement of the Israeli government and the Trump administration'--NSO once again sold its powerful software to Saudi Arabia."/>
						<outline text="Many Washington operators were willing to do lucrative business for the NSO Group, and it hasn't necessarily hurt their careers. "/>
						<outline text="Shapiro advised NSO through the end of 2018 and participated in Biden campaign strategy calls in 2020. He is now under consideration to be President Biden's special envoy to the Middle East."/>
						<outline text="That a consulting firm specializing in national-security tech like WestExec Advisors rejected NSO Group's entreaties, while advising other defense contractors and tech companies, shows just how beyond the pale NSO's products are. Working for Israeli hackers, WestExec consultants may have thought, would hurt their chances of re-entering government. (It's a decision validated by Biden appointing more than 15 members of the boutique firm to the administration.)"/>
						<outline text="Still, many Washington operators were willing to do lucrative business for the NSO Group, and it hasn't necessarily hurt their careers. Shapiro has been floated for a State Department appointment to continue Trump's policy of securing accords between Israel and Arab states. Shapiro declined to comment on the record."/>
						<outline text="The list of Washington operators who have benefited directly from working with NSO is long, and they don't want to talk about it. The consultancy Beacon Global Strategies'--founded by longtime Hillary Clinton adviser Andrew Shapiro, former CIA and Pentagon official Jeremy Bash, and former House aide Michael Allen'--quietly provided advice to NSO until mid-2019. Attorney Dan Jacobson provided legal services to NSO's parent company and joined the Biden administration this spring as general counsel for the Office of Administration. Rod Rosenstein, after two years as deputy attorney general, advised NSO in a lawsuit the Facebook affiliate WhatsApp had brought against it. Jeh Johnson, Obama's homeland security secretary who was in the running to be Biden's defense secretary, signed off on NSO's human rights policy. Obama homeland security official Juliette Kayyem advised the hacking group."/>
						<outline text="The company's PR is currently being done by Mercury Public Affairs, where retired Sen. Barbara Boxer is a co-chair and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is a partner. Mercury, which receives $120,000 monthly to represent NSO, did not respond to a request for comment."/>
						<outline text="The list possibly includes one current White House official. Anita Dunn took a leave of absence from her consulting firm SKDKnickerbocker and joined the Biden White House in January as a senior adviser. Her firm advised NSO Group in 2019. It's unclear whether she personally worked for the company. Dunn has circumvented federal ethics rules that require disclosures of income, assets, and clients by serving as a temporary employee in the executive branch and taking a salary just below a threshold that would require public filings. She says she plans to leave the White House soon."/>
						<outline text="Dunn's firm defended NSO on the record. Even if she may have not been directly working for NSO, Dunn was willing to lend her name'--hers is the D in SKDK'--to repair the company's image. ''What sets NSO apart from many other cyber technology firms is its commitment to an ethical business framework that relies on the expertise of people with national security and intelligence backgrounds from around the world to evaluate potential customers and review current customers,'' Dunn's firm told The Intercept in 2019. SKDK declined to comment to the Prospect."/>
						<outline text="The experts counseling NSO have hardly helped bring it closer toward ethical behavior; in fact, as the Pegasus Project trickles out new reporting, what's clear is that Washington consultants have lent a veneer of principle to a company whose malicious software has hacked more than 180 journalists and 14 world leaders."/>
						<outline text="The NSO Group's co-founder says that its spyware is designed to target ''bad guys,'' and is only sold to states that comply with its protocol. But its first annual Transparency and Responsibility Report, released last month, is not all that transparent about its clients. There's much more insight into the company'--its high regard for itself, its Silicon Valley vibes'--on NSO's active LinkedIn page, with posts celebrating Pride Month or Earth Day, and photos of ''a rave in the desert it hosted for employees to toast the end of Israel's coronavirus lockdown."/>
						<outline text="Without any irony, the company celebrated World Data Privacy Day in January on social media. ''At NSO Group, we have committed ourselves to high ethical business standards by embedding human rights protections throughout all aspects of our work,'' it posted, above an image of a padlock set against neon-colored zeroes and ones. Amid damning revelations about its spyware, not even the best consultants can rebrand NSO."/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="They had been public servants their whole careers. But when Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election, two departing Obama officials were anxious for work. Trump's win had caught them by surprise."/>
						<outline text="Sergio Aguirre and Nitin Chadda had reached the most elite quarters of U.S. foreign policy. Aguirre had started out of school as a fellow in the White House and a decade later had become chief of staff to U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power. Chadda, who joined the Pentagon out of college as a speechwriter, had become a key adviser to Secretary of Defense Ash Carter in even less time. Now, Chadda had a long-shot idea."/>
						<outline text="They turned to an industry of power-brokering little known outside the capital: strategic consultancies. Retiring leaders often open firms bearing their names: Madeleine Albright has one, as do Condoleezza Rice and former Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen. Their strategic consultancies tend to blur corporate and governmental roles. This obscure corner of Washington is critical to understanding how a President Joe Biden would conduct foreign policy. He has been picking top advisers from this shadowy world."/>
						<outline text="More from Jonathan Guyer"/>
						<outline text="At the outset of a new administration, high-ranking officials often join one of a dozen such firms, which are surprisingly bipartisan in their makeup, to help companies navigate the areas where their relationships give them power. The model was pioneered by Henry Kissinger, who through Kissinger Associates represented American Express and Coca-Cola, among other banks and transnationals. In Beijing, Washington, and developing countries, strategic consultants help corporations manage tricky regulations, potential crises, and new markets. Their behind-the-scenes work in world capitals can look a lot like lobbying."/>
						<outline text="The problem for Aguirre and Chadda was that neither young man was a marquee name. Chadda realized that the latest crop of senior officials hadn't yet started their own named consultancies. ''The thought for us was to build a living and breathing platform, with those who are enthusiastic about serving again,'' he said. Staying up late one night, they drafted a plan and came up with the first target they would pitch."/>
						<outline text="Mich¨le Flournoy had served as undersecretary of defense for policy from 2009 to 2012. Both Aguirre and Chadda had known her well in the Obama administration. Since leaving office, she'd spent several years in consulting and was hitting her stride. With Flournoy as senior adviser, Boston Consulting Group's defense contracts grew from $1.6 million in 2013 to $32 million in 2016. Before she joined, according to public records, BCG had not signed any contracts with the Defense Department."/>
						<outline text="Flournoy, while consulting, joining corporate boards, and serving as a senior fellow at Harvard's Belfer Center, had also become CEO of the Center for a New American Security in 2014. The think tank had an annual budget of about $9 million, and defense contractors donated at least $3.8 million while she was CEO. By 2017, she was making $452,000 a year."/>
						<outline text="If a Democrat were to win office, she would likely become the first woman defense secretary. She had considered an offer to serve as deputy to Trump's first secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, but ultimately withdrew from the vetting process and stuck to consulting. ''That's more of a labor of love,'' she told me. ''Building bridges between Silicon Valley and the U.S. government is really, really important.''"/>
						<outline text="Intrigued by Aguirre and Chadda's idea of starting her own shop, she had one condition: find another big name, so it wouldn't just be Flournoy and Associates."/>
						<outline text="They needed another co-founder. Establishing a new firm was an investment and a risk, and many Obama officials were already spoken for, some headhunted by corporations or consultancies, others returning to academic appointments or finding respite in research institutions'--many wearing all those hats at once."/>
						<outline text="Flournoy could carry her own private practice, but she didn't want a firm with her name on it alone. The trio reached out to defense and intelligence honchos, but with no luck. Then a particular Washington fixture came to light."/>
						<outline text="He had been Vice President Joe Biden's right-hand man for almost two decades and finished out the Obama administration as deputy secretary of state. He was known for his unimpeachable ethics. Having written Biden's speeches for years, he had started to enunciate with the vice president's drawl when he appeared on CNN. He had never cashed in on his international connections, years of face time with Saudi, Israeli, and Chinese leaders."/>
						<outline text="His name was Tony Blinken. With his commitment to join Flournoy as founding partner, a new strategic consultancy was born. They called it WestExec Advisors."/>
						<outline text="WEST EXECUTIVE AVENUE runs along the West Wing of the White House, the connection between presidential power and the offices where aides sit and do the real work. The name WestExec Advisors trades on its founders' recent knowledge of the highest echelons of decision-making. It also suggests they'll be walking down WestExec toward 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue some day soon."/>
						<outline text="The Obama campaign in 2008 made a pledge to exclude lobbyists from policy deliberations and, once in office, policymaking. ''Lobbyists are not bad people,'' then-Sen. Joe Biden said. ''Special interest groups are not bad people. But they are corrosive.'' Biden was the most modest vice president in recent history, coming into office with a net worth of less than $150,000. But afterward, he made big money, profiting from a multimillion-dollar book deal and earning $540,000 annually from a University of Pennsylvania center named for him that doesn't involve any teaching. He nevertheless promoted himself as Middle-Class Joe. ''I work for you'--not any industry,'' he tweeted last year."/>
						<outline text="But many of the people who work closely with Biden are enmeshed in the opaque world of strategic consultancies and by extension a network of the world's biggest businesses. If they've been consulting for corporations with offshore interests, this spells potential conflicts. ''One of the biggest gaps in ethics laws is that we don't require strategic consultants to register as lobbyists,'' said Mandy Smithberger of the Project on Government Oversight."/>
						<outline text="When it comes to foreign affairs, Biden and his advisers are nonideological and mainly transactional. In Obama's situation room, he sometimes urged restraint, according to people who were there, and sometimes was hawkish. Rather than being associated with a particular school of statecraft or a signature policy accomplishment, Biden is known for his intimacy with world leaders."/>
						<outline text="Tasked by Obama to end the Iraq War, Biden supported Nouri El-Maliki, the leader he knew, and rescued the Iraqi prime minister's career even though it ended up fracturing the country. When Maliki narrowly lost in 2010, Biden didn't give Iraqi political parties time to broker a new coalition. With Biden's endorsement, Maliki gained a second term; he grew more authoritarian, which is now widely believed to have led to the rise of ISIS. Biden ignored experts who were skeptical of Maliki and preferred to glad-hand. ''He came to deal with Iraqi politicians like local political kingpins in Delaware or Pennsylvania,'' said Robert Ford, who was deputy ambassador in Baghdad from 2008 to 2010."/>
						<outline text="Biden's foreign policy is a blank slate, onto which often-conflicted advisers from the national-security establishment will project actual policies."/>
						<outline text="There is no Biden Doctrine. ''He's not a guy who knows history. He's not a guy who is intellectually curious,'' said Emma Sky, who advised the U.S. military in Iraq. ''It's all about personal relationships.'' Those close bonds may cloud his judgment. He has expressed ''love'' for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu even after he had defied the Obama administration and stood by the late Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak as he assaulted protesters. In effect, Biden's foreign policy is a blank slate, onto which often-conflicted advisers from the traditional national-security establishment will project actual policies."/>
						<outline text="If ''personnel is policy,'' as Sen. Elizabeth Warren likes to say, we can learn a lot about Biden from his team. In addition to Blinken, advisers include Nicholas Burns (The Cohen Group), Kurt Campbell (The Asia Group), Tom Donilon (BlackRock Investment Institute), Wendy Sherman (Albright Stonebridge Group), Julianne Smith (WestExec Advisors), and Jake Sullivan (Macro Advisory Partners). They rarely discuss their connections to corporate power, defense contactors, private equity, and hedge funds, let alone disclose them."/>
						<outline text="I asked a Biden spokesperson if the campaign would commit to more transparency and expand the Obama-era pledge to strategic consultants. ''There's a difference between consulting and lobbying,'' he told me. ''There's a pretty strong line there '... So, presumably we don't have a ban on people who were consultants at one time or another, since I'm one myself.''"/>
						<outline text="AGUIRRE AND CHADDA RENTED an office suite three blocks from the White House. The newly hired operations director drove over card tables, folding chairs, and a Wi-Fi router in the trunk of her car. But this was hardly a scrappy startup."/>
						<outline text="WestExec promised to be more boutique than conventional consultancies like Albright Stonebridge Group or RiceHadleyGates. Most clients would have direct access to either Blinken or Flournoy. They also recruited an assortment of former colleagues as contractors to chip in, among them Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work, Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro, and Deputy CIA Director Avril Haines, who had helped design Obama's program of using drones for extrajudicial killings."/>
						<outline text="Now, they needed clients. The first step was hosting a party."/>
						<outline text="At their April 2018 launch, Aguirre and Chadda stood with drinks across the hall from WestExec's now furnished suite. It had a clubby feel thanks to purple lights and concrete walls. It must have been heartening to look across the room at Susan Rice, Tom Donilon, and Denis McDonough eating canap(C)s as a DJ spun."/>
						<outline text="The next day, they were back to reaching out to venture capitalists and corporate leaders. Their whole approach was based on word of mouth and the power of their founders' reputations. Initially, WestExec's website, with its cool black-and-white portraits in dark suits, simply listed Blinken by his role in the firm. By April, a boldfaced title had been added under his name: ''Former Deputy Secretary of State and Former Deputy National Security Advisor to the President.'' It must have appealed to clients."/>
						<outline text="To look more established, WestExec found partners in a private equity group and a Google affiliate."/>
						<outline text="The private equity firm Pine Island Capital Partners was incorporated a year earlier by John Thain. Blinken and Flournoy joined a startlingly high-profile roster of former policymakers, including four retired senators and the former chair of the Joint Chiefs. (Pine Island declined to comment.) Thain, an investment banker, had tanked Merrill Lynch, sold it off to Bank of America, and paid himself several bonuses along the way. At the height of the subprime mess, he spent $1.2 million remodeling his office, installing a $35,000 golden toilet. He seemed like a less-than-ideal partner for public servants."/>
						<outline text="Another partnership was with Google's in-house think tank, Jigsaw. WestExec's Robert Work, during his time at the Pentagon, collaborated with the tech company in an artificial-intelligence venture, as first reported by The Intercept. That AI initiative, known as Project Maven, led to an insurrection among Google staff upset about collaborating with the military. (''WestExec has done no work on Project Maven. Period,'' said Flournoy.) Though Jigsaw has since been removed from WestExec's list of partners, the Prospect has learned that Blinken and Flournoy have continued to work quietly and informally with Google engineers and executives, spitballing potential geopolitical threats. Schmidt Futures, Google founder and billionaire Eric Schmidt's philanthropy, has also hired WestExec."/>
						<outline text="The founders told executives they would share their ''passion'' for helping new companies navigate the complex bureaucracy of winning Pentagon contracts. They told giant defense contractors how to explain cutting-edge technologies to visitors from Congress. Their approach worked, and clients began to sign up."/>
						<outline text="One was an airline, another a global transportation company, a third a company that makes drones that can almost instantly scan an entire building's interior. WestExec would only divulge that it began working with ''Fortune 100 types,'' including large U.S. tech; financial services, including global-asset managers; aerospace and defense; emerging U.S. tech; and nonprofits."/>
						<outline text="The Prospect can confirm that one of those clients is the Israeli artificial-intelligence company Windward. With surveillance software that tracks ships in real time, two former Israeli naval intelligence officers established the company in 2010. Gabi Ashkenazi, former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, serves on its board. Windward also claims former CIA director David Petraeus as an investor, as well as a Hong Kong billionaire (most U.S. military-tech companies avoid money from China, experts told me, so they turn to investing in Israel)."/>
						<outline text="Strategic consultants' behind-the-scenes work in world capitals can look a lot like lobbying."/>
						<outline text="WestExec says they do not lobby. ''We'll tell you who to go talk to, but we're not going to go in there for you, and we're not going to facilitate the introduction,'' said one staffer. One of their offerings that attracted corporations, the same staffer told me, is an ''on-call National Security Council.''"/>
						<outline text="It wasn't until companies renewed contracts in December 2018 that Aguirre and Chadda felt that their strategic consultancy was in place. The plan was paying off. WestExec didn't need to do any marketing. CEOs had recommended them to other CEOs."/>
						<outline text="LAST YEAR, WESTEXEC'S corporate interests and their policymaking at last collided. On January 7, 2019, Tony Blinken and Mich¨le Flournoy chaired the biannual meeting of the liberal organization Foreign Policy for America. Over 50 representatives of national-security groups gathered in a boardroom at the Madison hotel in Washington. Blinken and Flournoy's roles with WestExec were not listed on the invitation or on the FP4A website."/>
						<outline text="The group worked through 24 agenda items, and the last one was ''The War in Yemen.'' Many Obama diplomats had expressed remorse for enabling Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's destructive campaign in the Arab world's poorest country. In 2015, Obama had dispatched Blinken to tell Mohammed bin Salman that the U.S. supported Saudi Arabia's right to defend itself and nothing more. But four years later, the U.S., through its arms sales, was party to an ongoing war. The death toll was over 100,000 in an asymmetric conflict, and the defense contractor Raytheon had sold Saudi Arabia more than $3 billion worth of bombs."/>
						<outline text="Four hours into the marathon policy discussion, many former officials joined progressive advocates in urging an end to weapons sales. The starting point, per FP4A's agenda, was to ''ask Congress to halt U.S. military involvement in the conflict.'' Most participants supported cutting all weapons sales, but one person stood apart: Flournoy tried to persuade the group that an outright ban on arms sales to Saudi Arabia wouldn't be a good idea. Putting conditions on their use was a better compromise, she said, one that defense contractors wouldn't lobby against, according to two attendees. Flournoy told me she had made a distinction between offensive and defensive weapons, saying that Saudi Arabia needed advanced Patriot missiles to protect itself."/>
						<outline text="It was an argument she had been making around the capital, but it didn't resonate among the left-leaning room and didn't affect the group's recommendation. To two people present, it sounded like Flournoy was working for Raytheon, which produces Patriot missiles."/>
						<outline text="Flournoy would not confirm whether WestExec currently works for them. ''Raytheon was not being considered as a client at that point,'' she said. ''When I take a policy position, I do so because I think it is in U.S. interests, and the views I express are solely my own, no one else's.''"/>
						<outline text="Another WestExec staffer wouldn't comment on whether the consultancy has Raytheon as a client but would only say the defense contractor is ''in the ballpark,'' noting they work for a ''defense prime,'' meaning one of the top five defense firms among which Raytheon ranks. (WestExec's own Robert Work has served on Raytheon's board since 2017.)"/>
						<outline text="WestExec is only one of Blinken and Flournoy's overlapping roles, which keep them updated on trends that others lack access to. Flournoy, for instance, previously served on the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board, the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, and the CIA director's External Advisory Board; each of these positions gives members access to sensitive information, which in turn provides insights useful to attracting and serving corporate clients. Membership requires ethics disclosures, though none of those documents are publicly available, adding another layer of opacity."/>
						<outline text="Flournoy also joined the board of Booz Allen Hamilton in October 2018, and it has signed 61 contracts with the Defense Department since. Last year, the role earned her $192,474 ($76,986 as cash, $115,488 in equity). She previously was a board member of the nonprofit Mitre Corporation, the IT company CSRA, and Rolls-Royce North America. She now serves on the board of Amida Technology Solutions and is a senior adviser to SparkCognition Government Systems, a new subsidiary that feeds the company's AI to government agencies."/>
						<outline text="''When we do take on a defense firm, we're careful and just thoughtful about the nature of the work that we do,'' Flournoy told me. ''There's work we would do, and there's work we wouldn't do.''"/>
						<outline text="AGUIRRE AND CHADDA FELT their strategic consultancy had far surpassed their hopes. As Joe Biden launched his presidential campaign in spring 2019, they were committed to the firm they had built. If Democrats took the White House, they won't close up WestExec."/>
						<outline text="''Think about it: If Biden were to win, we do think that companies will start coming to WestExec, for 'Hey, what is the commerce secretary thinking?''' one of the firm's members said. ''Because we likely have a history with that person or that staffer in our network somewhere. That will be something we can provide that we just don't provide right now.''"/>
						<outline text="Blinken is back to consulting for the vice president. In a video on Biden's Twitter feed this April, he was introduced as senior foreign-policy adviser, explaining the candidate's China policy. At the same time, WestExec advertises on its website that it will ''develop a strategy for expanding market access in China'' for clients. And a recent post on WestExec's LinkedIn page displays Obama and Blinken chatting at the end of the board table."/>
						<outline text="Chadda denied that Blinken was having it both ways. ''Volunteering for a political campaign, much like any other private pursuit, is done outside of formal employment and should never be implicated,'' he told me."/>
						<outline text="Despite multiple requests, neither the firm nor the Biden campaign would provide WestExec Advisors' client list. ''Transparency is very important to us,'' said a Biden spokesperson. Blinken had recused himself from work at WestExec, according to the campaign, yet his profile remains on the consultancy's website as well as on Pine Island Capital Partners'. Unmentioned on either page is his role in the campaign. After requests for comment from the Prospect, a Biden campaign official responded that Blinken will take a leave of absence from WestExec effective August 1. He is also in the process of leaving Pine Island Capital Partners, the campaign official added."/>
						<outline text="Such representational juggling is likely to influence how decisions are made. ''Registered lobbyist is a bullshit distinction,'' a former Obama official said. ''For me it's: Are you making a living based on monetizing a set of relationships or a policy domain with personal interest?''"/>
						<outline text="At the end of June, the campaign announced who would oversee foreign policy for Biden's transition team. It was Avril Haines, another former security chief whom Aguirre and Chadda had hired, now aiming to return with her WestExec colleagues back to West Executive Avenue."/>
						<outline text="An earlier version of this story said that the think tank CNAS had $48 million on hand when that figure represented contributions received from 2013 to 2017. The story has also been updated to reflect the boards Flournoy currently serves on and to clarify the relationship between WestExec, Robert Work, and Google. "/>

						<outline text="Shikma Schwartzman-Bressler (Hebrew: ×(C)×§××-- ××¨××'×¨ ; born July 10, 1980) is an Israeli physicist. A researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science, she is among those taking part in research at the CERN particle accelerator in Switzerland as a member of the ATLAS collaboration.[1] She is also a social activist and leading figure in the &quot;Black Flags&quot; protests against Benjamin Netanyahu.[2][3][4]"/>
						<outline text="Biography   [ edit ]  Bressler was born in Haifa, the second child of four, to a doctor mother and a father who was a senior worker at Elbit systems. She grew up in Kibbutz Gvat and Timrat. When she was younger she played basketball in the Hapoel Galil Elyon basketball team and in Israel's youth national team. After her army service, Bressler moved on to play for &quot;Ha'poel Haifa&quot;.[citation needed ] She retired from basketball after she was injured and began her studies at the Technion. She married and had two children. She later divorced and remarried and has five daughters.[5]"/>
						<outline text="Scientific career   [ edit ]  Bressler is a physicist at the Weizmann Institute of Science. She completed her bachelor's degree, with distinction, in physics and mathematics at the Technion, where she also completed her master's degree in physics in 2006 and a Ph.D. in 2011. In 2012, she joined the faculty at the Weizmann Institute.[3]"/>
						<outline text="In 2013, Bressler formed a team at the Weizmann Institute entrusted with the development of detectors and particle physics. This team deals with the development of advanced concepts in the field of radiation detectors. She is an active researcher at the CERN particle accelerator in Switzerland, where she deals with gathering data from the ATLAS experiment in search of physics beyond the standard model of particle physics.[3]"/>

						<outline text="[ edit ]   2020 &quot;Black Flag&quot; protests   [ edit ]  Shikma Bressler at a demonstration in Kiryat Bialik March 23, 2023In March 2020, Bressler founded and led the &quot;Black Flag Protests&quot;, along with two of her brothers, Yarden and Eyal, and two family friends.[4][1] Following the 2020 Israeli legislative elections, President Reuven Rivlin laid the task of forming a government on the chairman of the Blue and White party. Outgoing Knesset chairman, Yuli Edelstein, refused to give up his position for the new chairman in an attempt to prevent the establishment of a committee which would convene to deliberate on removing parliamentary immunity of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[6] Bressler and two of her brothers initiated protest convoys to the Knesset and protests near the homes of Knesset members and members of the Israel Resilience Party headed by Benny Gantz.[7] The protestors began with three demands.[8] The first, the election of a new chairman for the Knesset after the 3rd elections in a year, while Benny Gantz and the block of parties opposed to the continuation of Netanyahu's rule should be entrusted with the task of forming a government. Their second demand was the establishment of Knesset committees with parliamentary supervision, and the third demand was the legislation of an amendment to the basic law pertaining to the formation of a government and regulating government powers so that in the future, a person indicted on criminal charges would not be able to run for Prime Minister.[9][10][11] The protest movement spread throughout the country and came to be known as &quot;The Black Flag Protest&quot;.[12][13][4]"/>
						<outline text="2023 judicial reforms protest   [ edit ]  Arrest of Shikma Bressler at a demonstration in Kiryat Bialik March 23, 2023Leaders of the protest march to Jerusalem (from left to right: Ran Harnevo, Shikma Bressler, Moshe Radman, Ami Dror)On March 23, 2023, Bressler was detained by police during one of the many &quot;Day of Disruption&quot; protests held across Israel as part of the 2023 Israeli anti-judicial reform protests. She was later released. Former Prime Minister and protest leader, Ehud Barak, tweeted that Bressler's arrest was &quot;dictatorship in action&quot;. Knesset Member and Labor party leader, Merav Michaeli, stated that &quot;in a normal country Shikma Bressler would be given the Israel Prize. In the state of Netanyahu and  Ben-Gvir she is arrested as a common criminal.&quot;[14][15]In July 2023, Bressler announced they would march from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.[16]The march from Kaplan Street in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem was a protest against the law proposal to reduce the reasonableness clause.[17][18]"/>
						<outline text="In September 2023 it was claimed that Bressler was charging 20,000 USD for a meeting in person (or a personal Zoom meeting) with her while in New York City which caused a vocal outrage amongst her supporters and opponents alike.[19][20][21] The protest movement Kaplan Force said however the event was an uncoordinated private initiative, that Bressler didn't engage in paid meetings and wasn't expected to be in the United States.[21]"/>
						<outline text="Awards and recognition   [ edit ]  In 2016, Bressler received the Charles Clore award for research.[22]"/>
						<outline text="In 2020, Bressler appeared in TheMarker ' s list of 100 most influential people in Israel and in Forbes magazine's list of 50 most influential women in Israel.[23][24]"/>

						<outline text="Shikma Bressler, a mother of five who says her passion is life in the lab, has emerged as a symbol of the struggle against the government's divisive judicial overhaul."/>
						<outline text="''It's rare that you recognize you are in a real-time historical moment,'' Shikma Bressler said.   Credit...  Jack Guez/Agence France-Presse '-- Getty Images   The particle physicist was sitting at a cafe in Tel Aviv when a young waitress rushed over, gushing at her in admiration. An older couple, a husband and wife, at the next table looked over at her with tears in their eyes."/>
						<outline text="''You are our hope,'' the wife said. Later, the physicist stopped to chat with the couple on her way out, and hugged the woman."/>
						<outline text="''She's an honest, brave and genuine leader,'' said the husband, Natan Sitner, a retiree. ''She didn't come to this out of personal interest,'' Mr. Sitner said. ''When she gets up onstage, everyone listens and believes what she says.''"/>
						<outline text="For years, the physicist, Shikma Bressler, devoted herself to the lab she runs at a science institute near Tel Aviv, a job she describes as her passion, and to the raising of her five daughters in a small village in northern Israel, staying far away from politics."/>
						<outline text="But she has also become the face of the protests that have rocked Israel for months, marching on the streets of Tel Aviv on Saturday nights, exhorting crowds of protesters with speeches echoing with revolutionary ardor, and amplifying her message in a steady stream of social media posts. She was arrested, briefly, in March after she encouraged protesters to block a highway."/>
						<outline text="Dr. Bressler sealed her status as a symbol of the protest movement last month when she led a miles-long column of demonstrators on a multiday march to the hills of Jerusalem from coastal Tel Aviv. It evoked a biblical pilgrimage, and they picked up tens of thousands of supporters during the journey."/>
						<outline text="The march, Dr. Bressler said, was ''almost a spiritual experience,'' attracting Israelis angered by the government's contentious plans to reduce the influence of the Supreme Court, a move that prompted perhaps the deepest internal crisis since the foundation of the state 75 years ago. People along the way contributed huge quantities of food for the marchers. Somebody noticed that one of Dr. Bressler's shoes was torn and asked for her shoe size. She soon had seven pairs to choose from."/>
						<outline text="''It's rare that you recognize you are in a real-time historical moment,'' Dr. Bressler said during an interview in the cafe, reflecting on the events of the past few months. ''It's amazing to be living it as it happens and to be taking on some responsibility for this story.''"/>
						<outline text="After the march from Tel Aviv, many of the demonstrators camped out near Parliament until lawmakers passed the first law last week in a package of legislation intended to rein in the Supreme Court and give more power to the government."/>
						<outline text="While the far-right and religiously conservative governing coalition that campaigned for the changes argues that they are a much-needed move to bolster the authority of elected governments, critics like Dr. Bressler see them as an effort to erode Israel's democracy and worry that they could lead to a dictatorship."/>
						<outline text="''We are at a historical crossroads,'' Dr. Bressler said in the interview, which was conducted a few days after the vote. ''From here, there is no going back; we can only take one of two ways forward,'' she added."/>
						<outline text="''We can either fall into a very dark, extreme, racist place where the Israel that we know, in all its social and economic aspects, will be destroyed,'' she said, touching on another issue that has struck a nerve with liberal Israelis '-- the presence of ultranationalist ministers in the government with a history of anti-Arab incitement and homophobia. ''Or we can build a new stronger, better democracy for the good of all the people.''"/>
						<outline text="Dr. Bressler is a professor and runs a lab at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv. She is an active member of an international team experimenting with particle detectors at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, near Geneva '-- an effort, she said, to understand ''the other 95 percent of the universe beyond what we already know.''"/>
						<outline text="She said she never planned to become a leader of the protests, and had no political ambitions."/>
						<outline text="''If I had wanted to be a politician, I'd have gone into politics,'' she said."/>
						<outline text="Image A convoy of vehicles heading to Jerusalem in a protest against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2020.   Credit...  Abir Sultan/EPA, via Shutterstock  Dr. Bressler said she first became concerned about where Israel was headed in March 2020, when Benjamin Netanyahu, then the prime minister, as he is now, ordered a shutdown of the courts at the start of a coronavirus-related lockdown. Mr. Netanyahu cited health concerns for the move, but it also postponed the opening of his corruption trial, angering many Israelis."/>
						<outline text="Dr. Bressler said she and two of her three brothers decided they had to do something."/>
						<outline text="They devised a plan to lead a convoy of cars driving to Parliament in Jerusalem, and made video clips calling on people to join them. Dr. Bressler's clip circulated widely online, and scores of people turned up with their cars for the protest."/>
						<outline text="Encouraged by their success, Dr. Bressler and her siblings founded a group called Black Flags, one of the early anti-Netanyahu protest groups, and became actively involved in later protests that sought to oust the prime minister."/>
						<outline text="During the subsequent period when Mr. Netanyahu was out of office, from June 2021 until the end of 2022, Dr. Bressler settled back into her routine at the lab and at home '-- her eldest daughter is now 17; the youngest, age 5, is still in kindergarten."/>
						<outline text="But she returned to the streets for a huge protest in Tel Aviv on Jan. 14, days after the justice minister, Yariv Levin, introduced his plan to overhaul the country's judiciary."/>
						<outline text="The next Saturday night, the coordinating committee for a protest in Tel Aviv was seeking a presenter to go onstage and, after failing to recruit an actor or prominent journalist in time, decided to ask Dr. Bressler."/>
						<outline text="''Things evolved from week to week. It evolved until she became the face of the struggle,'' Nadav Galon, a spokesman for the committee, said of Dr. Bressler."/>
						<outline text="She stays on message in her speeches and frequent appearances in the Israeli news media, using plain language to convey what she calls the urgent mission to ''save the country.''"/>
						<outline text="Today, Dr. Bressler is not associated with any particular protest group."/>
						<outline text="The antigovernment protest camp embraces a broad section of mainstream Israelis who want to preserve a more pluralist and liberal society. It has no hierarchical or formal leadership; a highly organized coordinating committee is made up mostly of volunteers. Financing comes from contributions from Israel's business and tech communities and from crowdfunding."/>
						<outline text="Dr. Bressler said it was the nature of Israelis to respond when ''called to the flag,'' echoing the views of many Israelis that the protests are a patriotic struggle to protect a democracy at risk. A former basketball player, she spent her period of obligatory military service in a special track for outstanding athletes and lost several high school peers in the war between the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israel in 2006. Now, she said, it was her turn on the front lines."/>
						<outline text="As well as celebrity, her activism has put her in the cross hairs of Mr. Netanyahu's loyalists, who have branded the protesters as anarchists."/>

Menahem Kahana/Agence France-Presse '-- Getty Images  May Golan, the conservative minister for the advancement of the status of women, described Dr. Bressler as an agent of chaos. Tally Gotliv, an outspoken lawmaker from Mr. Netanyahu's Likud party, said Dr. Bressler enjoyed ''delusional fame based on lies.'' She added that protest organizers who disrupt the lives of lawmakers ''should be investigated by the police on suspicion of incitement.''"/>
						<outline text="A self-described political centrist, Dr. Bressler acknowledges that the protest movement cannot solve all of Israel's problems."/>
						<outline text="After the setback in Parliament last week, the organizing committee is focused on trying to maintain the momentum of the main Saturday night protests while Parliament is in a recess until October. Dr. Bressler said she found it ''magical'' that so many people kept showing up."/>

						<outline text="In the summer of 2019, as Paragon Solutions was building one the world's most potent cyberweapons, the company made a prescient decision: before courting a single customer, best get the Americans on side."/>
						<outline text="The Israeli start-up had watched local rival NSO Group, makers of the controversial Pegasus spyware, fall foul of the Biden administration and be blacklisted in the US. So Paragon sought guidance from top American advisers, secured funding from US venture capital groups and eventually scored a marquee client that eludes its competition: the US government."/>
						<outline text="Interviews with half a dozen industry figures about the divergent paths of the two companies underline how the shadowy spyware industry is being reshaped around those friendly to American interests."/>
						<outline text="According to four of those people, the US Drug Enforcement and Administration Agency is among the top customers for Paragon's signature product nicknamed Graphite. The DEA's use of Graphite was first reported by the New York Times."/>
						<outline text="The malware surreptitiously pierces the protections of modern smartphones and evades the encryption of messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp, sometimes harvesting the data from cloud backups '-- much like Pegasus does."/>
						<outline text="Paragon was set up by Ehud Schneorson, the retired commander of Unit 8200, the Israeli army's elite signals intelligence arm. According to people familiar with the company, which includes ex-Prime Minister Ehud Barak on its board, has secured investment from two US-based venture capital firms, Battery Ventures and Red Dot."/>
						<outline text="Paragon, Barak, Battery Ventures and Red Dot declined to comment."/>
						<outline text="In 2019, even before work on Graphite had been completed, on advice from a retired senior Mossad official, Paragon hired DC-based WestExec Advisors, the influential advisory group staffed by ex-Obama White House officials including Michele Flournoy, Avril Haines and Antony Blinken. Ex-US ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, was also consulted, people with knowledge of the advisory effort said. Shapiro declined to comment."/>
						<outline text="WestExec said it ''advised Paragon on its strategic approach to the US and European markets, as well as the formulation of its industry-leading ethical commitments designed to ensure the appropriate use of its technology,'' adding it was ''proud of our contributions in these critical areas.''"/>
						<outline text="After the election of Democratic president Joe Biden in 2021, Blinken was appointed secretary of state, while Haines is now director of national intelligence. Both had departed WestExec by the time of the Paragon contract, the lobbying firm said. Flournoy '-- once considered in the running to lead the defence department '-- remains an influential US voice on foreign affairs."/>
						<outline text="American approval, even if indirect, has been at the heart of Paragon's strategy. The company sought a list of allied nations that the US wouldn't object to seeing deploy Graphite. People with knowledge of the matter suggested 35 countries are on that list, though the exact nations involved could not be determined. Most were in the EU and some in Asia, the people said."/>
						<outline text="''Everything they did was with the strategy that at the end of the day, the US should see them as the good guys,'' said one person familiar with the decisions."/>
						<outline text="That contrasts with NSO's recent troubles. By 2019, assisted by the regional diplomacy of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, NSO was a $1bn company selling its wares to Saudi Arabia, Mexico and dozens of other countries."/>
						<outline text="By the time the Biden administration came into office, NSO's lucrative customers were proving to be its Achilles heel, as many of those regimes continued to deploy the multimillion-dollar weapon against journalists, dissidents and opposition leaders."/>
						<outline text="As evidence of abuse spread, such as the targeting of US diplomats in Uganda in 2021, NSO has found itself in the crosshairs both of the American government and the world's largest tech companies. Apple and WhatsApp owner Meta are suing it."/>
						<outline text="''There is a growing sense that this particular type of malware is so invasive, so surreptitious that its proliferation poses both a human rights risk and a counter-intelligence risk to the US,'' said Stephen Feldstein, who has studied the spread of spyware such as Pegasus and Graphite for the Carnegie Endowment."/>
						<outline text="For nearly a decade, the only restraint on some of the biggest spyware manufacturers was Israeli export controls, which regulate malware like Pegasus as weapons. Feldstein said that Israeli officials ''make decisions on geopolitical solutions, not on human rights abuses.''"/>
						<outline text="Paragon's founders, however, were more sensitive to the increasingly dim view the US was taking of the proliferation of cyberweapons."/>
						<outline text="After NSO's malware was tracked to the phones of associates of murdered Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Paragon declined Israeli government requests to replace Pegasus with Graphite in the Saudi armoury, according to two people familiar with the issue."/>
						<outline text="Paragon's decision to eschew a valuable Saudi contract eventually paid off. Two other Israeli firms, Quadream and Candiru, which sold similar hacking capabilities to the Saudi government, were outed by Microsoft and rights group Citizen Lab after their malware was used on journalists and dissidents. Candiru was blacklisted alongside NSO in Nov 2021. Quadream recently shut down operations, the Israeli paper Calcalist reported."/>
						<outline text="The US has stepped in further to reshape the spyware market to favour those who sell cyberweapons to the US and its allies, while curbing those who chase lucrative contracts with authoritarian regimes."/>
						<outline text="President Joe Biden signed an executive order in March barring any US agency from purchasing spyware that ''poses risks to national security or has been misused by foreign actors to enable human rights abuses around the world.''"/>
						<outline text="The wording of the executive order is seen by experts as targeting NSO, while carving out a space for companies like Paragon to continue selling similar spyware, but only to the closest of US allies. The American expectation '-- still unproven '-- is that friendly nations are less likely to abuse such a weapon on civil society, or to spy on US government officials deployed abroad."/>
						<outline text="''It's really making the case that the US believes that many of these kinds of tools are unlawful,'' said David Kaye, who as the UN's Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression spent years trying to hold the NSO Group accountable for its customers' abuse of its spyware. ''And if the proliferation of these tools is a national security problem, then that really changes the conversation from it being a human rights problem.''"/>
						<outline text="NSO said it ''does not believe that its placement on the [US Commerce Department blacklist] has ever been warranted,'' adding: ''ironically, other cyber intelligence companies who are not subject to the list sell to countries without any regulatory structure and that NSO refuses to make sales [to].''"/>
						<outline text="However, the DEA's purchase of Graphite, reportedly only for use by its partners in Mexico to help fight drug cartels, has begun to draw scrutiny. The DEA said it uses: ''every lawful investigative tool available to pursue the foreign-based cartels and individuals operating around the world responsible for the drug poisoning deaths of 107,735 Americans last year.''"/>
						<outline text="Congressman Adam Schiff, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, wrote to the DEA in December asking for more details on the purchase. Mexico is among the worst abusers of NSO's Pegasus which it bought nearly a decade ago."/>
						<outline text="Schiff wrote: ''such use [of spyware] could have potential implications for US national security, as well as run contrary to efforts to deter the broad proliferation of powerful surveillance capabilities to autocratic regimes and others who may misuse them.''"/>
						<outline text="This article has been updated to reflect that the DEA's use of graphite was first reported by the New York Times."/>

						<outline text="Fear Not, No WWIII Yet '' Bo Polny"/>
						<outline text="By Greg Hunter's USAWatchdog.com (Special presentation of Weekly News Wrap-Up WNW 603 for 10/13/23)"/>
						<outline text="Biblical cycle timing expert and geopolitical/financial analyst Bo Polny predicted last month on USAWatchdog.com that ''chaos was coming in early October.''  The Hamas/Israel war that started on October 6th proved him right.  The situation seems to be intensifying and spinning out of control by the hour.  Israel has called up 300,000 troops in the war with Hamas terrorists that murdered, wounded or kidnapped thousands of Israelis in a surprise attack last Friday.  Hamas is calling for a ''global Jihad, invasion of Israel and to attack Jews worldwide on Oct. 13.''  Even though this is already a bloody conflict that will, no doubt, get much worse, Polny predicts this is not going to be WWIII, at least not just yet.  Polny explains, ''If you truly understand the times we are living in today, do not fear World War III.  It is not the time for it.  That time point is Revelation 16, verse 12.  It says the Euphrates River dries up, and armies prepare for Armageddon.  I repeat, we are not at Revelation 16.''"/>
						<outline text="Polny is quick to point out that just because this is not Armageddon, it does not mean there will not be blood and financial meltdowns.  Polny thinks gold and silver go way up in price from here, and a lot of other things go way down in value, including the U.S. dollar.  Polny explains, ''God is going to intervene and destroy Mystery Babylon.  How does he do that?  Destroy the dollar.  You are going to see the U.S. dollar lose its status as the world's reserve currency.  It's going to collapse starting this year.  It has topped right now, and it will start collapsing in November.  There will be a huge collapse in the first quarter of 2024.  That's going to cause the bond markets to collapse.  That's going to cause the banking institutions to collapse.  That's going to cause the financial system to collapse.  That's going to cause real estate to take a 50% to 90% haircut.  Everything that Babylon has built gets destroyed.  We are going to get fulfillment.  What is the third seal of Revelation?  It is a financial rebalancing.  The wealth of the sinner, Babylon, is stored up for the righteous.''"/>
						<outline text="Polny says you can sum up what is coming as ''blessings and vindications.''  Polny still thinks President Donald Trump will be back in office sooner than later."/>

						<outline text="Last week, Rep. Alexandrio Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) hopped on a livestream to give a 'very fine people on both sides' damage control speech regarding the situation in Israel, after the Democratic Socialists of America came out for Hamas following last weekend's brutal attack on Israelis."/>
						<outline text="She did anything but clear the air... as Twitter followers couldn't help but notice that during the 45-second livestreamed social-media broadcast, the socialist lawmaker unmistakably appeared to break wind around the 38 second mark."/>
						<outline text="It came at a particularly awkward moment, during which ''AOC'' happened to be accusing Israel of genocidal war crimes after it struck back for the slaughter of more than a thousand innocent civilians'--including the rape and torture of many'--and the kidnapping of roughly 150 others whose fate remains unknown."/>
						<outline text="''[T]he United States has a responsibility to ensure accountability to human rights to prevent the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, and to ensure that horrors do not happen in the names of victims who do not want their [fart] tragedy used to justify further violence and injustice,'' she said."/>

						<outline text="'-- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@RepAOC) October 12, 2023But while few would have predicted it to be the next development in a story that has shocked the world and fueled global anxieties like never before about the outbreak of World War III, it is not the first time farts have become an unwanted diversion for AOC."/>
						<outline text="One of her first acts as a freshman lawmaker was to draft the ''Green New Deal,'' a multi-trillion-dollar framework for revamping the entire U.S. economy in order to achieve net-zero carbon emissions."/>
						<outline text="Unfortunately, the plan was widely ridiculed for its outlandish proposals'--not the least of which was its fixation on regulating cow farts."/>
						<outline text="Despite the popular rejection of it at the time, leftists and globalists have continued to push the Green New Deal agenda under different labels, including President Joe Biden's ''Build Back Better'' plan and the ''smart city'' initiatives being coordinated by the World Economic Forum."/>
						<outline text="And at least one nation'--New Zealand'--has attempted to impose a tax on cow farts'--although it is unclear how they are assessed."/>
						<outline text="In all likelihood, Ocasio''Cortez, who let the video remain up on her Twitter site as of Friday morning, felt no sense of shame over her own methane emission."/>
						<outline text="She has performed other acts of public humiliation before, including dancing to bongos while enraged citizens jeered her at a town-hall meeting."/>

						<outline text="At least two past Democratic presidential candidates who have publicly cut the cheese went on to bomb in the ballot box."/>
						<outline text="Hillary Clinton left the normally loquacious Sens. John Edwards and Barack Obama practically speechless after a burst during a November 2007 CNN debate ahead of the Democratic primary."/>
						<outline text="Although Clinton was by far the better known name and widely considered to be the frontrunner at the time, Obama wound up closing the gap and going on to win the election'--and two terms in office'--while Clinton would go on to win the nomination in 2016 only to lose the general election."/>
						<outline text="In 2019, while conducting an on-camera interview with then Hardball! host Chris Matthews, Rep. Eric Swalwell, considered to be a serious political upstart with a bright future and a formidable political adversary for then-President Donald Trump, appeared to shift a bit in his seat."/>
						<outline text="Shortly thereafter, Swalwell let out a ripper that reared back his shoulders, but continued to make his point without missing a beat."/>
						<outline text="At that point Swalwell already had launched and failed a short-lived presidential campaign, which lasted only about three months. However, the fart'--and subsequent news of an affair with a Chinese honeytrap spy named Fang Fang'--not only raised serious concerns about Swalwell's judgment and integrity, but also made it hard to take him seriously."/>
						<outline text="In January, Swalwell was one of three Democrat lawmakers who was stripped of his committee assignments due to concerns that he was unfit to serve on the House Intelligence Committee since he was potentially a compromised Chinese asset."/>

						<outline text="When the debate with his friend across the table became too tiresome, Dechert shut it down with a ''loud, prolonged fart,'' wrote Page Six reporter Mara Siegler, ''while yelling, as if to underscore his point, 'I'm farting!'''"/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) suggested that the United States consider bombing Iranian oil refineries if the Iranian-funded terror group Hamas follows through on its promise to start executing hostages in the Gaza Strip."/>
						<outline text="In addition to murdering and raping hundreds of Israeli civilians over the weekend, terrorists took hostages, including Americans back to Gaza as hostages. Since then, they've threatened to execute those held captive every time Israel launches a retaliatory airstrike that kills civilians."/>
						<outline text="On Fox News, Graham reacted to that threat by issuing one of his own to the Iranian government."/>
						<outline text="''Well, for every Israeli or American hostage executed by Hamas, we should take down an Iranian oil refinery. The only way you're going to keep this war from escalating is to hold Iran accountable,'' began the famously-hawkish Graham."/>
						<outline text="He continued:"/>
						<outline text="How much more death and destruction do we have to take from the Iranian regime? I am confident this was planned and funded by the Iranians. Hamas is a bunch of animals who deserve to be treated like animals. So if I was Israel, I would go in on the ground. There is no truce to be had here. I would dismantle Hamas. This is the best opportunity Israel has to destroy Hamas. Take it to the Iranians. If you harm one American in Syria by using your Iranian militia against us in Syria, if you escalate the war by urging Hezbollah to attack Israel in the north, if Hamas kills one American Israeli hostage, we're going to blow up your oil refineries and put you out of business. It is now time to take the war to the Ayatollah's backyard."/>
						<outline text="At least 9 Americans have been confirmed to have died in the attack, which was characterized by the intentional killing of civilians as well as mass rape. An unknown number of Americans are missing and have been taken hostage."/>

						<outline text="Marina Machete became the first transgender woman to win Miss Portugal last week, making her one of two trans contestants so far to compete for Miss Universe later this year."/>
						<outline text="Machete, a 28-year-old flight attendant, thanked her supporters for the ''positive and empowering'' messages she has received since being crowned Thursday. "/>
						<outline text="''To all of you watching, I just want to say that, just like the universe, your possibilities in life are limitless,'' she said in a video shared on Instagram over the weekend. ''So don't limit yourself to any dream that you have.''"/>
						<outline text="She added that she is excited to meet the other delegates at the 72nd Miss Universe pageant in El Salvador in November. "/>
						<outline text="In July, Rikkie Valerie Kolle, 22, became the first trans woman to be crowned Miss Netherlands."/>
						<outline text="''Yes I'm trans and I want to share my story but I'm also Rikkie and that's what matters to me,'' she wrote in an Instagram post at the time. ''I did this on my own strength and enjoyed every moment.''"/>
						<outline text="Shortly after she was crowned, she revealed that she became the target of hate speech online. "/>
						<outline text="''I thought we were really accepting ... in the Netherlands, but the hate comments show the other side of our society. I hope that's a wake-up call,'' she told Reuters at the time. ''For now, I fully ignore it. I focus on the good things coming my way.''"/>
						<outline text="It appears that Machete and Kolle will be the only transgender contestants among the 90 women who will compete for the crown on Nov. 18. There are two more qualifying pageants '-- in Mongolia and China '-- before the Miss Universe pageant next month, and no local reporting has identified any trans contestants."/>
						<outline text="Miss Universe began allowing trans women to compete in 2012 and, in 2018, Angela Ponce became the first trans woman to do so after she was crowned Miss Spain. "/>
						<outline text="In 2021, Kataluna Enriquez became the first trans woman to compete in the Miss USA pageant after she was crowned Miss Nevada, though she did not go on to compete in that year's Miss Universe pageant. In February, Daniela Arroyo Gonzlez became the first trans woman to compete in Miss Universe Puerto Rico, where she finished within the top 10 finalists, according to her Instagram."/>
						<outline text="However, not all pageants have been open to including trans women. In July, more than 100 transgender men entered the Miss Italy pageant after the pageant's organizer said Miss Italy wouldn't allow trans women to compete."/>
						<outline text="Anne Jakkapong Jakrajutatip, a Thai businesswoman and transgender advocate, bought the Miss Universe Organization for $20 million last year, making her the first woman to own the pageant."/>

						<outline text="Arnold Schwarzenegger told Rob Lowe that ''ruining'' cities is what Democrats are all about, and he has ''no idea'' why they are like that, in a new podcast interview out on Thursday."/>
						<outline text="The movie star and former California governor was a recent guest on SiriusXM's Literally! With Rob Lowe podcast, and spoke about what it is that being a Republican is all about, and what Democrats would say they are about."/>
						<outline text="In addition to all the big name celebrities, host and Hollywood star Lowe has had political guests on his podcast before, such as George Stephanopoulos and Jen Psaki. Schwarzenegger, of course, is in both categories and Lowe asked about what it means to be a Republican."/>
						<outline text="Lowe gave an example, saying that former GOP Congressman from California David Dreier said being Republican is about, ''in no particular order, strong military, low taxes, less government, more personal freedoms.''"/>
						<outline text="''Strong law enforcement,'' said Schwarzenegger."/>
						<outline text="Lowe then asked what a Democrat would say it means to be a Democrat, and Schwarzenegger offered an answer."/>
						<outline text="''Ruin your cities,'' he said."/>
						<outline text="Lowe asked for more explanation and Schwarzenegger said, ''That's what the Democrats would say. We are about ruining the cities. We want to f*ck up every city in America. That seems to be the theme right now.''"/>
						<outline text="As for why that's what they're about, he had ''no idea.''"/>
						<outline text="The full episode will be available on Thursday from SiriusXM."/>
						<outline text="LOWE: Okay, let me ask you this, and I ask people this all the time. David Dreier, good friend of ours and a good man. Surfer for many, many, many years. He used to have the greatest, what makes me a Republican, and he had I think four or five things. I think it was, in no particular order, strong military, low taxes, less government, more personal freedoms. There might have been one more, but it makes sense to know ''"/>
						<outline text="ARNOLD: Strong law enforcement."/>
						<outline text="LOWE: Strong law enforcement. And then I'd like to know, I always ask Democrats what it means to be a Democrat in that way. And I, I think whatever anybody would say ''"/>
						<outline text="ARNOLD: Ruin your cities."/>
						<outline text="LOWE: What would they say?"/>
						<outline text="ARNOLD: Ruin your cities."/>
						<outline text="LOWE: What's that?"/>
