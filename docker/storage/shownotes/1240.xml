						<outline text="Imperial finally released a derivative of Ferguson's code. I figured I'd do a review of it and send you some of the things I noticed. I don't know your background so apologies if some of this is pitched at the wrong level."/>
						<outline text="My background. I wrote software for 30 years. I worked at Google between 2006 and 2014, where I was a senior software engineer working on Maps, Gmail and account security. I spent the last five years at a US/UK firm where I designed the company's database product, amongst other jobs and projects. I was also an independent consultant for a couple of years. Obviously I'm giving only my own professional opinion and not speaking for my current employer."/>
						<outline text="The code. It isn't the code Ferguson ran to produce his famous Report 9. What's been released on GitHub is a heavily modified derivative of it, after having been upgraded for over a month by a team from Microsoft and others. This revised codebase is split into multiple files for legibility and written in C++, whereas the original program was ''a single 15,000 line file that had been worked on for a decade'' (this is considered extremely poor practice). A request for the original code was made 8 days ago but ignored, and it will probably take some kind of legal compulsion to make them release it.  Clearly, Imperial are too embarrassed by the state of it ever to release it of their own free will, which is unacceptable given that it was paid for by the taxpayer and belongs to them."/>
						<outline text="The model.  What it's doing is best described as ''SimCity without the graphics''. It attempts to simulate households, schools, offices, people and their movements, etc. I won't go further into the underlying assumptions, since that's well explored elsewhere."/>
						<outline text="Non-deterministic outputs. Due to bugs, the code can produce very different results given identical inputs. They routinely act as if this is unimportant."/>
						<outline text="This problem makes the code unusable for scientific purposes, given that a key part of the scientific method is the ability to replicate results. Without replication, the findings might not be real at all '' as the field of psychology has been finding out to its cost. Even if their original code was released, it's apparent that the same numbers as in Report 9 might not come out of it."/>
						<outline text="Non-deterministic outputs may take some explanation, as it's not something anyone previously floated as a possibility. "/>
						<outline text="The documentation says:"/>
						<outline text="The model is stochastic. Multiple runs with different seeds should be undertaken to see average behaviour."/>
						<outline text="''Stochastic'' is just a scientific-sounding word for ''random''. That's not a problem if the randomness is intentional pseudo-randomness, i.e. the randomness is derived from a starting ''seed'' which is iterated to produce the random numbers. Such randomness is often used in Monte Carlo techniques. It's safe because the seed can be recorded and the same (pseudo-)random numbers produced from it in future. Any kid who's played Minecraft is familiar with pseudo-randomness because Minecraft gives you the seeds it uses to generate the random worlds, so by sharing seeds you can share worlds."/>
						<outline text="Clearly, the documentation wants us to think that, given a starting seed, the model will always produce the same results."/>
						<outline text="Investigation reveals the truth: the code produces critically different results, even for identical starting seeds and parameters."/>
						<outline text="I'll illustrate with a few bugs. In issue 116 a UK ''red team'' at Edinburgh University reports that they tried to use a mode that stores data tables in a more efficient format for faster loading, and discovered '' to their surprise '' that the resulting predictions varied by around 80,000 deaths after 80 days:"/>
						<outline text="That mode doesn't change anything about the world being simulated, so this was obviously a bug."/>
						<outline text="The Imperial team's response is that it doesn't matter: they are ''aware of some small non-determinisms'', but ''this has historically been considered acceptable because of the general stochastic nature of the model''. Note the phrasing here: Imperial know their code has such bugs, but act as if it's some inherent randomness of the universe, rather than a result of amateur coding. Apparently, in epidemiology, a difference of 80,000 deaths is ''a small non-determinism''."/>
						<outline text="Imperial advised Edinburgh that the problem goes away if you run the model in single-threaded mode, like they do. This means they suggest using only a single CPU core rather than the many cores that any video game would successfully use. For a simulation of a country, using only a single CPU core is obviously a dire problem '' as far from supercomputing as you can get. Nonetheless, that's how Imperial use the code: they know it breaks when they try to run it faster. It's clear from reading the code that in 2014 Imperial tried to make the code use multiple CPUs to speed it up, but never made it work reliably. This sort of programming is known to be difficult and usually requires senior, experienced engineers to get good results. Results that randomly change from run to run are a common consequence of thread-safety bugs. More colloquially, these are known as ''Heisenbugs''."/>
						<outline text="But Edinburgh came back and reported that '' even in single-threaded mode '' they still see the problem. So Imperial's understanding of the issue is wrong.  Finally, Imperial admit there's a bug by referencing a code change they've made that fixes it. The explanation given is ''It looks like historically the second pair of seeds had been used at this point, to make the runs identical regardless of how the network was made, but that this had been changed when seed-resetting was implemented''. In other words, in the process of changing the model they made it non-replicable and never noticed."/>
						<outline text="Why didn't they notice? Because their code is so deeply riddled with similar bugs and they struggled so much to fix them that they got into the habit of simply averaging the results of multiple runs to cover it up'... and eventually this behaviour became normalised within the team."/>
						<outline text="In issue #30, someone reports that the model produces different outputs depending on what kind of computer it's run on (regardless of the number of CPUs). Again, the explanation is that although this new problem ''will just add to the issues'' '...  ''This isn't a problem running the model in full as it is stochastic anyway''."/>
						<outline text="Although the academic on those threads isn't Neil Ferguson, he is well aware that the code is filled with bugs that create random results. In change #107 he authored he comments: ''It includes fixes to InitModel to ensure deterministic runs with holidays enabled''.  In change #158 he describes the change only as ''A lot of small changes, some critical to determinacy''."/>
						<outline text="Imperial are trying to have their cake and eat it.  Reports of random results are dismissed with responses like ''that's not a problem, just run it a lot of times and take the average'', but at the same time, they're fixing such bugs when they find them. They know their code can't withstand scrutiny, so they hid it until professionals had a chance to fix it, but the damage from over a decade of amateur hobby programming is so extensive that even Microsoft were unable to make it run right."/>
						<outline text="No tests. In the discussion of the fix for the first bug, Imperial state the code used to be deterministic in that place but they broke it without noticing when changing the code."/>
						<outline text="Regressions like that are common when working on a complex piece of software, which is why industrial software-engineering teams write automated regression tests. These are programs that run the program with varying inputs and then check the outputs are what's expected. Every proposed change is run against every test and if any tests fail, the change may not be made."/>
						<outline text="The Imperial code doesn't seem to have working regression tests. They tried, but the extent of the random behaviour in their code left them defeated. On 4th April they said:  ''However, we haven't had the time to work out a scalable and maintainable way of running the regression test in a way that allows a small amount of variation, but doesn't let the figures drift over time.''"/>
						<outline text="Beyond the apparently unsalvageable nature of this specific codebase, testing model predictions faces a fundamental problem, in that the authors don't know what the ''correct'' answer is until long after the fact, and by then the code has changed again anyway, thus changing the set of bugs in it. So it's unclear what regression tests really mean for models like this '' even if they had some that worked."/>
						<outline text="Undocumented equations. Much of the code consists of formulas for which no purpose is given. John Carmack (a legendary video-game programmer) surmised that some of the code might have been automatically translated from FORTRAN some years ago."/>
						<outline text="For example, on line 510 of SetupModel.cpp there is a loop over all the ''places''  the simulation knows about. This code appears to be trying to calculate R0 for ''places''. Hotels are excluded during this pass, without explanation."/>
						<outline text="This bit of code highlights an issue Caswell Bligh has discussed in your site's comments: R0 isn't a real characteristic of the virus. R0 is both an input to and an output of these models, and is routinely adjusted for different environments and situations. Models that consume their own outputs as inputs is problem well known to the private sector '' it can lead to rapid divergence and incorrect prediction. There's a discussion of this problem in section 2.2 of the Google paper, ''Machine learning: the high interest credit card of technical debt''."/>
						<outline text="Continuing development. Despite being aware of the severe problems in their code that they ''haven't had time'' to fix, the Imperial team continue to add new features; for instance, the model attempts to simulate the impact of digital contact tracing apps."/>
						<outline text="Adding new features to a codebase with this many quality problems will just compound them and make them worse. If I saw this in a company I was consulting for I'd immediately advise them to halt new feature development until thorough regression testing was in place and code quality had been improved."/>
						<outline text="Conclusions. All papers based on this code should be retracted immediately. Imperial's modelling efforts should be reset with a new team that isn't under Professor Ferguson, and which has a commitment to replicable results with published code from day one. "/>
						<outline text="On a personal level, I'd go further and suggest that all academic epidemiology be defunded. This sort of work is best done by the insurance sector. Insurers employ modellers and data scientists, but also employ managers whose job is to decide whether a model is accurate enough for real world usage and professional software engineers to ensure model software is properly tested, understandable and so on. Academic efforts don't have these people, and the results speak for themselves."/>

							<outline text="Randomly determined process"/>
							<outline text="Stochastic refers to a randomly determined process.[1] The word first appeared in English to describe a mathematical object called a stochastic process, but now in mathematics the terms stochastic process and random process are considered interchangeable.[2][3][4][5][6] The word, with its current definition meaning random, came from German, but it originally came from Greek  ÏÏÏÏÎÏ (st&quot;khos), meaning 'aim, guess'.[1]"/>
							<outline text="The term stochastic is used in many different fields, particularly where stochastic or random processes are used to represent systems or phenomena that seem to change in a random way. The term is used in the physical sciences such as  biology,[7] chemistry,[8] ecology,[9]  neuroscience,[10] and physics[11] as well as technology and engineering fields such as image processing, signal processing,[12] information theory,[13] computer science,[14] (including the field of artificial intelligence), cryptography[15] and telecommunications.[16] It is also used in finance, due to seemingly random changes in financial markets[17][18][19] as well as in medicine, linguistics,  music, media, colour theory,  botany, manufacturing, and geomorphology."/>
							<outline text="Stochastic social science theory is similar to systems theory."/>
							<outline text="Etymology   [ edit ]  The word stochastic in English was originally used as an adjective with the definition &quot;pertaining to conjecturing&quot;, and stemming from a Greek word meaning &quot;to aim at a mark,  guess&quot;, and the Oxford English Dictionary gives the year 1662 as its earliest occurrence.[1] In his work on probability Ars Conjectandi, originally published in Latin in 1713, Jakob Bernoulli  used the phrase &quot;Ars Conjectandi sive Stochastice&quot;, which has been translated to  &quot;the art of conjecturing or stochastics&quot;.[20] This phrase was used, with reference to Bernoulli, by Ladislaus Bortkiewicz,[21] who in 1917 wrote in German the word stochastik with a sense meaning random.  The term stochastic process first appeared in English in a 1934 paper by  Joseph Doob.[1] For the term and a specific mathematical definition, Doob cited another 1934 paper, where the term stochastischer Proze  was used in German by Aleksandr Khinchin,[22][23] though the German term had been used earlier in 1931 by Andrey Kolmogorov.[24]"/>
							<outline text="Artificial intelligence   [ edit ]  In artificial intelligence, stochastic programs work by using probabilistic methods to solve problems, as in simulated annealing, stochastic neural networks, stochastic optimization, genetic algorithms, and genetic programming. A problem itself may be stochastic as well, as in planning under uncertainty."/>
							<outline text="Mathematics   [ edit ]  In the early 1930s, Aleksandr Khinchin gave the first mathematical definition of a stochastic process as a family of random variables indexed by the real line.[25][22][a] Further fundamental work on probability theory and stochastic processes was done by Khinchin as well as other mathematicians such as Andrey Kolmogorov, Joseph Doob, William Feller, Maurice Fr(C)chet, Paul L(C)vy, Wolfgang Doeblin, and Harald Cram(C)r.[27][28] Decades later Cram(C)r referred to the 1930s as the &quot;heroic period of mathematical probability theory&quot;.[28]"/>
							<outline text="In mathematics, the theory of stochastic processes is considered to be an important contribution to  probability theory, [29] and continues to be an active topic of research for  both theoretical reasons and applications.[30][31][32]"/>
							<outline text="The word stochastic is used to describe other terms and objects in mathematics. Examples include a stochastic matrix, which describes a stochastic process known as a Markov process, and stochastic calculus, which involves differential equations and  integrals based on stochastic processes such as the Wiener process, also called the Brownian motion process."/>
							<outline text="Natural science   [ edit ]  One of the simplest continuous-time stochastic processes is Brownian motion. This was first observed by botanist Robert Brown while looking through a microscope at pollen grains in water."/>
							<outline text="Physics   [ edit ]  The name &quot;Monte Carlo&quot; for the stochastic Monte Carlo method was popularized by physics researchers StanisÅaw Ulam, Enrico Fermi, John von Neumann, and Nicholas Metropolis, among others. The name is a reference to the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco where Ulam's uncle would borrow money to gamble.[33] The use of randomness and the repetitive nature of the process are analogous to the activities conducted at a casino.Methods of simulation and statistical sampling generally did the opposite: using simulation to test a previously understood deterministic problem. Though examples of an &quot;inverted&quot; approach do exist historically, they were not considered a general method until the popularity of the Monte Carlo method spread."/>
							<outline text="Perhaps the most famous early use was by Enrico Fermi in 1930, when he used a random method to calculate the properties of the newly discovered neutron. Monte Carlo methods were central to the simulations required for the Manhattan Project, though were severely limited by the computational tools at the time. Therefore, it was only after electronic computers were first built (from 1945 on) that Monte Carlo methods began to be studied in depth. In the 1950s they were used at Los Alamos for early work relating to the development of the hydrogen bomb, and became popularized in the fields of physics, physical chemistry, and operations research. The RAND Corporation and the U.S. Air Force were two of the major organizations responsible for funding and disseminating information on Monte Carlo methods during this time, and they began to find a wide application in many different fields."/>
							<outline text="Uses of Monte Carlo methods require large amounts of random numbers, and it was their use that spurred the development of pseudorandom number generators, which were far quicker to use than the tables of random numbers which had been previously used for statistical sampling."/>
							<outline text="Biology   [ edit ]  Stochastic resonance: In biological systems, introducing stochastic &quot;noise&quot; has been found to help improve the signal strength of the internal feedback loops for balance and other vestibular communication.[34] It has been found to help diabetic and stroke patients with balance control.[35] Many biochemical events also lend themselves to stochastic analysis. Gene expression, for example, has a stochastic component through the molecular collisions'--as during binding and unbinding of RNA polymerase to a gene promoter'--via the solution's Brownian motion."/>
							<outline text="Creativity   [ edit ]  Simonton (2003, Psych Bulletin) argues that creativity in science (of scientists) is a constrained stochastic behaviour such that new theories in all sciences are, at least in part, the product of a stochastic process."/>
							<outline text="Computer science   [ edit ]  Stochastic ray tracing is the application of Monte Carlo simulation to the computer graphics ray tracing algorithm. &quot;Distributed ray tracing samples the integrand at many randomly chosen points and averages the results to obtain a better approximation. It is essentially an application of the Monte Carlo method to 3D computer graphics, and for this reason is also called Stochastic ray tracing.&quot;[citation needed ]"/>
							<outline text="Stochastic forensics analyzes computer crime by viewing computers as stochastic processes."/>
							<outline text="Finance   [ edit ]  The financial markets use stochastic models to represent the seemingly random behaviour of assets such as stocks, commodities, relative currency prices (i.e., the price of one currency compared to that of another, such as the price of US Dollar compared to that of the Euro), and interest rates. These models are then used by quantitative analysts to value options on stock prices, bond prices, and on interest rates, see Markov models. Moreover, it is at the heart of the insurance industry."/>
							<outline text="Geomorphology   [ edit ]  The formation of river meanders has been analyzed as a stochastic process"/>
							<outline text="Language and linguistics   [ edit ]  Non-deterministic approaches in language studies are largely inspired by the work of Ferdinand de Saussure, for example, in functionalist linguistic theory, which argues that competence is based on performance.[36][37] This distinction in functional theories of grammar should be carefully distinguished from the langue and parole distinction. To the extent that linguistic knowledge is constituted by experience with language, grammar is argued to be probabilistic and variable rather than fixed and absolute.  This conception of grammar as probabilistic and variable follows from the idea that one's competence changes in accordance with one's experience with language. Though this conception has been contested,[38] it has also provided the foundation for modern statistical natural language processing[39] and for theories of language learning and change.[40]"/>
							<outline text="Manufacturing   [ edit ]  Manufacturing processes are assumed to be stochastic processes.  This assumption is largely valid for either continuous or batch manufacturing processes.  Testing and monitoring of the process is recorded using a process control chart which plots a given process control parameter over time.  Typically a dozen or many more parameters will be tracked simultaneously.  Statistical models are used to define limit lines which define when corrective actions must be taken to bring the process back to its intended operational window."/>
							<outline text="This same approach is used in the service industry where parameters are replaced by processes related to service level agreements."/>
							<outline text="Media   [ edit ]  The marketing and the changing movement of audience tastes and preferences, as well as the solicitation of and the scientific appeal of certain film and television debuts (i.e., their opening weekends, word-of-mouth, top-of-mind knowledge among surveyed groups, star name recognition and other elements of social media outreach and advertising), are determined in part by stochastic modeling. A recent attempt at repeat business analysis was done by Japanese scholars[citation needed ] and is part of the Cinematic Contagion Systems patented by Geneva Media Holdings, and such modeling has been used in data collection from the time of the original Nielsen ratings to modern studio and television test audiences."/>
							<outline text="Medicine   [ edit ]  Stochastic effect, or &quot;chance effect&quot; is one classification of radiation effects that refers to the random, statistical nature of the damage. In contrast to the deterministic effect, severity is independent of dose. Only the probability of an effect increases with dose."/>
							<outline text="Music   [ edit ]  In music, mathematical processes based on probability can generate stochastic elements."/>
							<outline text="Stochastic processes may be used in music to compose a fixed piece or may be produced in performance. Stochastic music was pioneered by Iannis Xenakis, who coined the term stochastic music. Specific examples of mathematics, statistics, and physics applied to music composition are the use of the statistical mechanics of gases in Pithoprakta, statistical distribution of points on a plane in Diamorphoses, minimal constraints in Achorripsis, the normal distribution in ST/10 and Atr(C)es, Markov chains in Analogiques, game theory in Duel and Strat(C)gie, group theory in Nomos Alpha (for Siegfried Palm), set theory in Herma and Eonta,[41] and Brownian motion in N'Shima.[citation needed ] Xenakis frequently used computers to produce his scores, such as the ST series including Morsima-Amorsima and Atr(C)es, and founded CEMAMu. Earlier, John Cage and others had composed aleatoric or indeterminate music, which is created by chance processes but does not have the strict mathematical basis (Cage's Music of Changes, for example, uses a system of charts based on the I-Ching). Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Issacson used generative grammars and Markov chains in their 1957 Illiac Suite. Modern electronic music production techniques make these processes relatively simple to implement, and many hardware devices such as synthesizers and drum machines incorporate randomization features. Generative music techniques are therefore readily accessible to composers, performers, and producers."/>
							<outline text="[ edit ]  Stochastic social science theory is similar to systems theory in that events are interactions of systems, although with a marked emphasis on unconscious processes.  The event creates its own conditions of possibility, rendering it unpredictable if simply for the number of variables involved.  Stochastic social science theory can be seen as an elaboration of a kind of 'third axis' in which to situate human behavior alongside the traditional 'nature vs. nurture' opposition.  See Julia Kristeva on her usage of the 'semiotic', Luce Irigaray on reverse Heideggerian epistemology, and Pierre Bourdieu on polythetic space for examples of stochastic social science theory.[citation needed ]"/>
							<outline text="The term &quot;Stochastic Terrorism&quot; has fallen into frequent use [42] with regard to Lone wolf (terrorism). The terms &quot;Scripted Violence&quot; and &quot;Stochastic Terrorism&quot; are linked in a &quot;cause &amp;lt;&amp;gt; effect&quot; relationship. &quot;Scripted Violence&quot; rhetoric can result in an act of &quot;Stochastic Terrorism.&quot; The phrase &quot;scripted violence&quot; has been used in social science since at least 2002.[43]"/>
							<outline text="Author David Neiwert, who wrote the book Alt-America, told Salon interviewer Chauncey Devega:"/>
							<outline text="Scripted violence is where a person who has a national platform describes the kind of violence that they want to be carried out. He identifies the targets and leaves it up to the listeners to carry out this violence. It is a form of terrorism. It is an act and a social phenomenon where there is an agreement to inflict massive violence on a whole segment of society. Again, this violence is led by people in high-profile positions in the media and the government. They're the ones who do the scripting, and it is ordinary people who carry it out."/>
							<outline text="Think of it like Charles Manson and his followers. Manson wrote the script; he didn't commit any of those murders. He just had his followers carry them out.[44]"/>
							<outline text="Subtractive color reproduction   [ edit ]  When color reproductions are made, the image is separated into its component colors by taking multiple photographs filtered for each color. One resultant film or plate represents each of the cyan, magenta, yellow, and black data. Color printing is a binary system, where ink is either present or not present, so all color separations to be printed must be translated into dots at some stage of the work-flow. Traditional line screens which are amplitude modulated had problems with moir(C) but were used until stochastic screening became available. A stochastic (or frequency modulated) dot pattern creates a sharper image."/>

						<outline text="Professor Neil Ferguson is a regular guest on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. One such appearance was on March 30. It was the 7.50am slot, to be precise, when Prof Ferguson, not surprisingly, repeated the Government's 'stay-at-home' message."/>
						<outline text="How ironic '' to put it mildly '' this particular soundbite, on that particular morning, seems with hindsight."/>
						<outline text="What no one realised at the time was that Prof Ferguson, whose coronavirus research prompted the lockdown, was not alone as he was being interviewed from his home on Today; he was entertaining a guest who was, how shall we say, not a 'member of his household'."/>
						<outline text="The guest in fact was his girlfriend, Antonia Staats. She is 38 and married. He is 51 and understood to be separated from his wife. Might Miss Staats have even been in Prof Ferguson's bed at the time he went on air? It was early morning, after all."/>
						<outline text="Pictured: Antonia Staats, 38, works for Avaaz, a global online activist network. She and her band of Left-wing colleagues had their own message for the general public: 'Stay at home'"/>
						<outline text="Professor Neil Ferguson (pictured) has now admitted he made a grave 'error of judgment' and resigned from his Sage role"/>
						<outline text="The affair, in other words, has not only opened up Prof Ferguson to accusations of hypocrisy but also ridicule."/>
						<outline text="'Lockdown, Pants Down, Steps Down,' is how the Guido Fawkes website headlined the revelation which resulted in Prof Ferguson's immediate resignation as a Downing Street adviser."/>
						<outline text="He was a key member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) which has been informing the Government's response to the pandemic, earning him the nickname 'Professor Lockdown,' a rather unfortunate sobriquet in the circumstances."/>
						<outline text="But he has never fitted the popular stereotype of a bookish academic. He is a fitness fanatic who normally wears jeans, T-shirt and jacket. And Miss Staats, a Left-wing campaigner and a mother of two, is certainly not the typical 'other woman'. She is believed to be in an open marriage."/>
						<outline text="The two met about 18 months ago through the online dating site OkCupid. Perhaps we should not be too surprised given Prof Ferguson's background. The data-driven matchmaking app '' created by four Harvard maths students '' uses scientific modelling to work 'algorithm magic' to find a 'mathematical soulmate'."/>
						<outline text="Few will see their relationship in such romantic terms, however, given the scandal surrounding their 'illegal' trysts."/>
						<outline text="Prof Ferguson is understood to be living apart from his wife Kim, 54. They married in 2004 and have a teenage son."/>
						<outline text="His estranged wife is the daughter of a respected Oxford deputy headmaster and lives in a £1million, end of crescent, terrace townhouse (jointly owned with Prof Ferguson) in the fashionable Jericho district of Oxford, an area beloved of the town's liberal elite."/>
						<outline text="She describes herself as a 'sustainability educator' and is the director of several companies devoted to green issues '' possibly the only things she has in common with her husband's younger lover."/>
						<outline text="Antonia Staats grew up in Isny, southern Germany, went to university in Berlin and came to London to obtain a masters in Asian politics from the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), where her husband works."/>
						<outline text="He is a Cambridge graduate and senior lecturer in Arabic Linguistics at SOAS and has met Prof Ferguson; they share an interest in data science."/>
						<outline text="Pictured: Antonia Staats joins other campaigners from Avaaz in holding a photo-call outside Parliament with a man dressed as Prime Minister Boris Johnson, pushing the plunger on a &quot;No-Deal Bomb&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Pictured: Chris Lucas, husband of Antonia Staats, who is Prof Neil Ferguson's married mistress"/>
						<outline text="Miss Staats herself works for Avaaz, a global online activist network. Avaaz '' meaning 'voice' in several European, Middle Eastern and Asian languages '' says its mission is to 'close the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want'."/>
						<outline text="Two weeks before the UK was plunged into lockdown, she and her band of Left-wing colleagues had their own message for the general public: 'Stay at home'. Everyone, the group declared, should 'avoid unnecessary close contact and stay at home when we can.' More than half-a-million signed up to the online pledge."/>
						<outline text="The revelations about Avaaz makes news of Miss Staats's secret assignations with Prof Ferguson all the more incredible."/>
						<outline text="Before being deleted, her Facebook account highlighted some of her other activities with Avaaz."/>
						<outline text="In 2016, she took to social media in search of young Londoners who were unhappy with the referendum result as part of her 'Pleasedontgouk' campaign."/>
						<outline text="The following year she was pictured protesting outside Parliament against Rupert Murdoch's media empire, which she accused of 'pulling the strings' of Theresa May's government."/>
						<outline text="Even though German-born Miss Staats was ineligible to vote in December's general election, she was busy encouraging others to vote tactically."/>
						<outline text="Avaaz has also fought vociferously for greater protection for 'Press abuse victims' and wanted the second part of the Leveson inquiry '' intended to examine relationships between journalists and the police '' to go ahead."/>
						<outline text="Oh, yes, and Miss Staats is also a climate change campaigner. Curiously, though '' or predicatably some might say '' her Facebook posts reveal she is happy to jet back to Germany for ski holidays."/>
						<outline text="She spoke about her middle class life with an au pair and a cleaner and her relationship with her husband on the 'Life in Pandemic' podcast which was 'broadcast' on March 31, the day after she stayed at Prof Ferguson's London home when he appeared on the Today programme."/>
						<outline text="'Chris [her husband] has it incredibly easy in the sense that we already had a set-up working from home,' she said. 'You know we have little other stuff to worry about, right? You know we're not renting. Even with the reduced schedule, I still get paid the same amount as when I was working kind of proper full days."/>
						<outline text="'And I didn't have to scramble to find remote access to what I need for work, or, you know, monitors, computers, whatever I need at home, we had all of that and even so, it's a strain.'"/>
						<outline text="She continued: 'I think strained has sounded too negative, but it's an interesting relationship challenge. I mean, for, you know, Chris and my relationship'... because we spend a lot more time and quite different time with each other all of a sudden, right?'"/>
						<outline text="It must be especially challenging '' or strained '' of course, if you have an 'open marriage' and you want to spend time with someone else."/>
						<outline text="Pictured: The south London home of Antonia Staats"/>
						<outline text="One wonders what Prof Ferguson's family, or rather his parents, make of his lover's supposedly open marriage? They are pillars of the community back in his native Wales. His father John, 73, is a member of the local parish council while his mother Kathy, 74, was a librarian who later became an Anglican priest, for the parish of Bro Arwystli in the Diocese of Bangor."/>
						<outline text="'We're very proud of him [Prof Ferguson],' she told the local paper after their son became one of the most famous scientists in the country. 'We worry about him but we're very proud of him.' How many times has Miss Staats visited Prof Ferguson during the lockdown? At least twice, that we know of. Millions of couples kept apart during the past weeks will take a dim view of their potentially dangerous liaisons. She travelled across London '' Miss Staats is understood to live in south London, Professor Ferguson in west London '' to see him. The first of Miss Staats' visits, on Monday March 30, coincided with a public warning by Prof Ferguson that the week-old lockdown would have to remain until June."/>
						<outline text="A few days earlier, he announced, again on BBC Radio 4's Today programme '' that he was self-isolating in his flat."/>
						<outline text="'I've been in so many meetings in the last few weeks,' he told listeners. 'We think there's infectiousness for about a day before symptoms '' and I was actually in a Downing Street Press conference. The more serious point it kind of highlights the need for the response which has been enacted.'"/>
						<outline text="Miss Staats made a similar revelation '' about her husband '' at around the same time on the 'Life in Pandemic' podcast."/>
						<outline text="'Chris has not been feeling great and thinks he's got it,' she said. 'But, you know, we can't know for sure. So what now? Do we assume he's had it? And if so, does that change how comfortable we would feel going to see his parents or not? But until there is a test that would be widely available to help establish whether you have indeed gone through it or not, you just don't know.'"/>
						<outline text="Nevertheless friends, it has been reported, say that she was in Prof Ferguson's flat on the morning of his 7.50am slot on Today."/>
						<outline text="On April 8, Miss Staats was at his flat again. The contradiction of what he says in public and what he does in private was highlighted two days later on April 10, again on Today. 'We clearly don't want these measures to continue any longer than is absolutely necessary,' he said. 'I mean the economic costs, social costs, personal and health costs are huge, but we don't want to set out polices which maintain the suppression of transmission of this virus.'"/>
						<outline text="Prof Ferguson has now admitted he made a grave 'error of judgment' and resigned from his Sage role. He said he 'acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus and completely isolating myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms.'"/>
						<outline text="His mother-in-law, Eileen Pirie, 79, said: 'I think it is absolutely disgraceful the things that are being said about him. All of this derision because he invited a woman into his flat? Is this really such a big deal? Neil has organised, not single-handedly but to a great degree, our getting out of this huge and awful situation that we are all in.'"/>
						<outline text="Miss Staats has reportedly told friends she did not believe their actions in meeting to be hypocritical as she considers the households to be one."/>
						<outline text="Few people, one suspects, would agree with her."/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="How many people are likely to die in the United States of Covid-19? How many hospital beds is the country going to need? When will case numbers peak?"/>
						<outline text="To answer those questions, many hospital planners, media outlets, and government bodies '-- including the White House '-- relied heavily on one particular model out of the many that have been published in the past two months: the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)."/>
						<outline text="The model first estimated in late March that there'd be fewer than 161,000 deaths total in the US; in early April, it revised its projections to say the total death toll through August was ''projected to be 60,415'' (though it acknowledged the range could be between 31,221 and 126,703)."/>
						<outline text="The model has been cited often by the White House and has informed its policymaking. But it may have led the administration astray: The IHME has consistently forecast many fewer deaths than most other models, largely because the IHME model projects that deaths will decline rapidly after the peak '-- an assumption that has not been borne out."/>
						<outline text="On Wednesday, the US death count passed the 60,000 mark that the IHME model had said was the likely total cumulative death toll. The IHME on April 29 released a new update raising its estimates for total deaths to 72,433, but that, too, looks likely to be proved an underestimate as soon as next week. Even its upper bound on deaths '-- now listed as 114,228 by August '-- is questionable, as some other models expect the US will hit that milestone by the end of May, and most project it will in June."/>
						<outline text="One analysis of the IHME model found that its next-day death predictions for each state were outside its 95 percent confidence interval 70 percent of the time '-- meaning the actual death numbers fell outside the range it projected 70 percent of the time. That's not great! (A recent revision by IHME fixed that issue; more on this below.)"/>
						<outline text="This track record has led some experts to criticize the model. ''It's not a model that most of us in the infectious disease epidemiology field think is well suited'' to making projections about Covid-19, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch told reporters."/>
						<outline text="But if that's the case, how has it risen to such prominence among policymakers? Other models have done better than IHME's at predicting the course of the epidemic, and many of them use approaches epidemiologists believe are more promising. Yet it's the IHME model that has generally guided policymakers, for the most part, in the direction of focusing on a return to normal."/>
						<outline text="One potential explanation for its outsize influence: Some of the factors that make the IHME model unreliable at predicting the virus may have gotten people to pay attention to it. For one thing, it's more simplistic compared to other models. That means it can be applied in ways more complicated models could not, such as providing state-level projections (something state officials really wanted), which other modelers acknowledged that they didn't have enough data to offer."/>
						<outline text="Meanwhile, its narrow confidence intervals for state-by-state estimates meant it had quotable (and optimistic) topline numbers. A confidence interval represents a range of numbers wherein the model is very confident the true value will lie. A narrow range that gives ''an appearance of certainty is seductive when the world is desperate to know what lies ahead,'' a criticism of the IHME model published in the Annals of Internal Medicine argued. But the numbers and precise curves the IHME is publishing ''suggests greater precision than the model is able to offer.''"/>
						<outline text="The criticism of the IHME model, and an emerging debate over epidemiology models more broadly, has brought to light important challenges in the fight against the coronavirus. Good planning requires good projections. Models are needed to help predict resurgences and spot a potential second wave. Dissecting what the IHME model got wrong, what other models got right, and how the public and policymakers read these models is essential work in order to create the best pandemic plans possible."/>
						<outline text="What's wrong with the IHME model of the coronavirus?Models of disease spread are meant to help decision-makers in an environment where math will outperform intuitions. Most people have a hard time thinking about exponential growth, which is why many were taken by surprise in March as the virus spread. That's why models can be useful."/>
						<outline text="Models usually lay out some foundational assumptions and offer projections based on those assumptions. The IHME model seeks to project death rates and hospitalization rates assuming widespread social distancing and strong measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Since testing is so unreliable at identifying the infection rate, the model uses only death rates as data (though evidence from all-cause mortality data suggests we're undercounting coronavirus-caused deaths, too)."/>
						<outline text="That projected hospitalization rate was one of the things that set it apart, IHME researcher Ali Mokdad told me. It was one of the few models offering that projection, and it was actionable information governments could grab on to and plan around."/>
						<outline text="Another reason it rose in prominence was IHME's decision to model the effects of strong social distancing measures. That choice proved correct '-- strong measures were indeed taken across the US '-- and the lower death numbers the model churned out as a result reportedly led to it being received favorably by the Trump administration."/>
						<outline text="But as the weeks have passed, it has become clear that the IHME's projections have been too optimistic, and slow to adjust to reflect the fact that deaths have plateaued rather than rapidly decreasing to zero. The IHME has been regularly updating its model as new data comes in, but the updates have often been slow enough that the numbers are absurd by the time they're changed in an update. For example, in late April the model still stated the expected total death toll was 60,000, even as the US was clearly only a few days from that milestone."/>
						<outline text="Mokdad told me when we talked that a fix was in the works, and it went up a few days later: The model now projects 73,433 deaths by August. That, too, is probably an underestimate '-- most other models project that total will be reached next week."/>
						<outline text="In the IHME's defense, it does offer a 95 percent confidence interval that is more accurate than the topline numbers. That range goes from 59,343 '-- significantly less than the number of people already dead of the virus '-- to 114,228. That might sound like a wide range, but it's still optimistic, and the actual toll is on track to lie outside that range entirely. MIT projects the US will surpass that upper bound in mid-June, and the Los Alamos forecast, like the MIT one, predicts the country will burst through the IHME's 95 percent confidence interval in around six weeks."/>
						<outline text="That's one of the core complaints about the IHME model: its confidence intervals seem too narrow, both for its next-day and several-months-ahead predictions. For instance, when used to predict the number of deaths in a state the very next day (which doesn't require any complex modeling of the long-term effects of uncertain policies), other researchers found the true deaths were outside of the 95 percent confidence interval given by the model 70 percent of the time. Those are embarrassingly poor results."/>
						<outline text="The day-to-day numbers are jumpy because some counties don't report numbers every day, Mokdad told me. ''The model is kind of confused because states are not reporting deaths consistently,'' he said, adding, ''The model assumes deaths will increase and then come back down,'' and so it reacts poorly when deaths instead vary day to day. Smoothing over the course of a week '-- the latest update the IHME team made '-- means the model should be more predictive."/>
						<outline text="Indeed, the latest update to the model solves the problem where the next-day deaths are usually outside the model's confidence interval by giving the model extremely wide confidence intervals. That's commendable. It is better to be honest about your extremely high uncertainty than to claim certainty you don't have."/>
						<outline text="That might lead to unsatisfying models with extremely wide ranges '-- 176 to 3,885 deaths today '-- but if that's an accurate reflection of the state of uncertainty, then so be it. It's better to have a wide confidence interval, acknowledging your uncertainty, than to have a narrow one that is usually wrong. And if next-day deaths are usually wrong, as IHME's are, that undermines confidence in the long-term predictive value of the model."/>
						<outline text="(But while the IHME has made its day-to-day confidence intervals larger, it still has very narrow confidence intervals for its projections several weeks into the future '-- which is odd, as there should be even more uncertainty about those.)"/>
						<outline text="An even bigger issue with the IHME model is that the way the model is published can obscure its problems. When it's updated, it can be hard to see what its old, obviated predictions were. A website, covid-projections.com, has been set up so that you can look at the predictions made by old versions of the IHME model (and at the history of other models). The IHME models are frequently fairly far off."/>
						<outline text="The IHME model is unusual compared to other epidemiological models for its design, too. While most of the models use standard epidemiology modeling tactics like SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered modeling) or use computer simulations, the IHME model is effectively just about fitting a curve from early data in China and Italy to the disease's trajectory elsewhere."/>
						<outline text="The IHME model is based ''on a statistical model with no epidemiologic basis,'' the Annals of Internal Medicine critique argues."/>
						<outline text="The IHME team has defended its model against those complaints."/>
						<outline text="''We're willing to make a forecast. Most academics want to hedge their bets and not be found to ever be wrong,'' IHME director Christopher Murray told Politico. ''That's not useful for a planner '-- you can't go to a hospital and say you might need 1,000 ventilators, or you might need 5,000.''"/>
						<outline text="The model has gotten better, but flaws remainThe change to the model has certainly improved it, but some problems with the confidence intervals remain. The new model acknowledges extremely high uncertainty about what will happen tomorrow '-- in my state, California, it says there will be between 5 and 103 deaths tomorrow. That's a really wide range."/>
						<outline text="But on May 20, the model is entirely sure there will be zero deaths. The 95 percent confidence interval runs from zero deaths to ... zero deaths."/>
						<outline text="The IHME's model of deaths in California reports lots of uncertainty about what will happen tomorrow but extremely high confidence about what will happen in late May.    That's an extremely strong claim. I pressed the IHME team about whether they were sure of it. Mokdad said the model's zero-deaths predictions were correct: ''Based on the graph, in certain states, yes '-- in California, May 17, zero. The virus is not circulating anymore; you would expect it to go to zero.''"/>
						<outline text="But the virus is still circulating in California. On April 28, there were 1,187 new cases reported in the state. Even if all infections in California stopped instantly today, it is likely that some already infected people would die in mid-May or later."/>
						<outline text="California's case numbers (like those of many states) are declining, but only slowly, as social distancing has limited the spread of the virus but not fully stopped it. That ties into another problem with the IHME model: It assumes that social distancing measures, once put in place, are always sufficient to rapidly decrease case numbers to zero."/>
						<outline text="In the report explaining the model, the researchers write that they look at four measures: ''School closures, non-essential business closures including bars and restaurants, stay-at-home recommendations, and travel restrictions including public transport closures. Days with 1 measure were counted as 0.67 equivalents, days with 2 measures as 0.334 equivalents and with 3 or 4 measures as 0.''"/>
						<outline text="In other words, the model has a built-in assumption that once three of those measures have been put into place, cases will rapidly fall to zero. No new data can change that assumption, which is why the model continues to project zero deaths by mid-May in any area that hasn't lifted social distancing restrictions, even though case numbers have only plateaued rather than declined in many areas."/>
						<outline text="There are many similar frustratingly confident predictions: On July 12, the model says, we'll need between 0 and 12 hospital beds in the whole US for coronavirus patients, and there will be 0 deaths at any point after July 12."/>
						<outline text="Why the IHME model's problems shouldn't be used as an indictment of epidemiology more broadlyAll these concerns make it frustrating to many epidemiologists that the IHME model is the one being widely used and cited. ''That the IHME model keeps changing is evidence of its lack of reliability as a predictive tool,'' epidemiologist Ruth Etzioni told Stat News in an article about the problems with the model. ''That it is being used for policy decisions and its results interpreted wrongly is a travesty unfolding before our eyes.''"/>
						<outline text="Alex Merz, a microbiologist at the University of Washington's School of Medicine, has written that ''@IHME_UW's overly optimistic modeling projections contributed to this debacle'' of the coronavirus's rapid spread in the US, and condemned their ''amazing shrinking error band that, preposterously, constricts to zero uncertainty in mid-June. That is not only bad science communication '-- it is bad science.''"/>
						<outline text="The IHME model has also brought the discipline under fire from other fields. Tyler Cowen, whose widely read blog Marginal Revolution has linked many of the papers demonstrating how poorly the IHME model works, argued ''now really is the time to be asking tough questions about epidemiology, and yes, epidemiologists.''"/>
						<outline text="That's not fair, many epidemiologists say '-- the model doesn't use any of the standard tools of the discipline, and they hate it too."/>
						<outline text="''That the IHME model keeps changing is evidence of its lack of reliability as a predictive tool''"/>
						<outline text="''The IHME approach departs from classic epidemiological modeling,'' epidemiological modelers at the University of Texas at Austin argued. ''Rather than using systems of equations to project the person-to-person transmission of the virus, the [IHME] model postulates that COVID-19 deaths will rise exponentially and then decline in a pattern that roughly resembles a bell curve (i.e., normal distribution).'' (Their paper puts forward their own attempt at modeling the disease with a curve-fitting approach, but one tweaked to use better data and to better represent uncertainty.)"/>
						<outline text="So it might not be fair to draw conclusions about the field as a whole from one model that mostly avoided using its standard tools."/>
						<outline text="Moreover, the public should be aware that there are better models. The Imperial College model that the British government relied on to inform their country's coronavirus strategy has held up reasonably well, with case numbers loosely tracking the model's predictions for what would happen if social distancing were implemented (as it was shortly after the model was published). It, too, has been frequently revised in response to new data and has come under criticism for overconfidence, but the inaccuracies are smaller and less pervasive, and the initial numbers before any revisions weren't that far off."/>
						<outline text="Other models, employing more standard epidemiological approaches, perform even better '-- though usually in narrower domains, like trying to project just the peak of the outbreak, or just the rate of new cases."/>
						<outline text="The IHME team says their model performed pretty well on key problems like predicting the peak in most states (it'll be clear in coming weeks how true that is) and that they're continuing to revise it to make it better. Meanwhile, as the debate over epidemiological models heats up, it's fair to say that holding the shortcomings of the IHME model against epidemiology as a whole isn't fair."/>
						<outline text="We don't have all the answersBut that still leaves the question: Why did the IHME model become so popular?"/>
						<outline text="The flaws I've noted above were also features that made the model appealing when it was first launched. It was optimistic, projecting lower deaths than other models. It was clear and precise, with narrow confidence intervals. It projected hospitalizations, which few others were doing '-- though those projections turned out to be wrong because not enough was known to project hospitalizations well at that stage. In a time of uncertainty, the IHME model was compelling."/>
						<outline text="But it turns out the uncertainty being reflected in a lot of other, better models is showing up for a reason '-- there really is still a lot unknown about the course this disease will take."/>
						<outline text="As my colleague Matt Yglesias has written, ''We need to value scientists and listen to experts, but part of listening means understanding that right now, what they're saying is that they do not have all the answers.''"/>
						<outline text="Given the enormous uncertainty ahead, responsible scientists are avoiding giving dramatic topline numbers they're unsure of, emphasizing the very wide confidence intervals on their estimates, and being careful not to publish results that the Trump administration or the public may interpret as definitive."/>
						<outline text="But people keep searching for definitive answers (understandably so), and so any model that is presented more confidently will rise to prominence over models that are humbler and better reflect the confusion."/>
						<outline text="The IHME model is one of several released by researchers at the University of Washington, but it has been far more widely cited and discussed than the others '-- despite being less accurate."/>
						<outline text="Ultimately, the problem may not be that some models are inaccurate. It was predictable that some models would be inaccurate, with the situation as confusing as it is. There are dozens of models, and ideally we'd be doing something like aggregating them and weighting each according to how well it has performed so far in predicting the crisis."/>
						<outline text="The current process is almost exactly the opposite of that. Most models are nearly ignored, while a few are cited by the White House and widely referred to in the press. The process that makes some models prominent is not a process that picks out the best of the best '-- and in fact, it may actively be picking out worse models, by emphasizing ones with notable numbers and statistics to cite, by leaning into the seductive ''appearance of certainty'' that researchers have warned about."/>
						<outline text="In other words, the fact that many epidemiological models are performing badly isn't great, but it could be part of a productive process of arriving at better models. But the media, policymakers, and the public need to be conscious of what kind of models we gravitate to and why. If we elevate the ones we like and quote numbers from them as if they're definitive, then the models will certainly end up shedding more heat than light."/>

						<outline text="A draft government report projects covid-19 cases will  surge to about 200,000 per day by June 1, a staggering jump that would be accompanied by more than 3,000 deaths each day."/>
						<outline text="The document predicts a sharp increase in both cases and deaths beginning about May 14, according to a copy shared with The Washington Post. The forecast stops at June 1, but shows both daily cases and deaths on an upward trajectory at that point."/>
						<outline text="The White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention disavowed the report, although the slides carry the CDC's logo. The creator of the model said the numbers are unfinished projections shown to the CDC as a work in progress."/>
						<outline text="The work contained a wide range of possibilities and modeling was not complete, according to Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who created the model. He said he didn't know how the update was turned into a slidedeck by government officials and shared with news organizations. The data was first reported by the New York Times."/>
						<outline text="''I had no role in the process by which that was presented and shown,'' said Lessler, who added that the data was presented as an ''FYI'' of work still in progress to officials within FEMA. ''It was not in any way intended to be a forecast.''"/>
						<outline text="Lessler said that while the exact numbers and charts in the CDC document may differ from the final results, they do show accurately how covid-19 cases could spiral out of control. He said 100,000 cases per day by the end of the month is within the realm of possibility. Much depends on political decisions being made today."/>
						<outline text="Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access."/>
						<outline text="''There are reopening scenarios where it could get out of control very quickly,'' Lessler said."/>
						<outline text="One federal official said the data was presented at a recent briefing for the National Response Coordination Center, a part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that coordinates federal support during major incidents and emergencies. The official, who was not authorized to discuss internal government briefings, spoke on the condition of anonymity."/>
						<outline text="It was not immediately clear whether the projections, which also carry  the logos of the Departments of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, are based on ramped up testing, the attempt to reopen some states, the time lag between a rise in cases and deaths or some combination of those factors."/>
						<outline text="The White House issued a statement Monday that ''this is not a White House document, nor has it been presented to the Coronavirus Task Force or gone through interagency vetting. This data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the task force, or data that the task force has analyzed."/>
						<outline text="''The President's phased guidelines to open up America again are a scientific driven approach that the top health and infectious disease experts in the federal government agreed with. The health of the American people remains President Trump's top priority, and that will continue as we monitor the efforts by states to ease restrictions.''"/>
						<outline text="A spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the agency did not issue the projections."/>
						<outline text="The forecast is at odds with remarks made Sunday evening by President Trump, who said the United States could eventually suffer as many as 100,000 deaths. At 3,000 deaths per day and rising, the national total would quickly outstrip that number if the new report is correct."/>
						<outline text="A senior White House official said the document would not change the White House planning on reopening."/>
						<outline text="White House officials have been relying on other models to make decisions on reopening, including the IHME model and a ''cubic model'' prepared by Trump adviser and economist Kevin Hassett and the Council of Economic Advisers."/>
						<outline text="On Monday, however, the IHME model '-- widely used by states and heavily relied upon in the past by the white House '-- also revised its deaths significantly upward  to reflect the  reopenings in several states."/>
						<outline text="The IHME model '-- created by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington '-- now estimates America will reach nearly 135,000 deaths by August 1. That number is more than double its mid-April estimate of 60,308 deaths."/>
						<outline text="IHME's  higher projections ''reflect the effect of premature relaxation of restrictions,'' said its creator Christopher Murray. ''In this era where those mandates being relaxed, people should be aware the risk of infection is still there.''"/>
						<outline text="The number of deaths estimated by the IHME model by June 1 is still much lower than those in the draft government report. But the IHME model has consistently is considered among the more optimistic projections."/>
						<outline text="Even more optimistic than that, however, is the ''cubic model'' prepared by Trump adviser Hassett. People with knowledge of that model say it currently shows deaths dropping precipitously in May '-- and essentially going to zero by May 15."/>
						<outline text="Despite the White House's optimistic rhetoric, experts warn the country could be living with a sizable covid-19 case load for some time."/>
						<outline text="''We don't have the testing. We don't have the contract tracing. We can't detect a rebound. It's really problematic place to be. This is not where we want to be,'' said Jeffrey Shaman, one of the country's leading epidemiologists at Columbia University."/>
						<outline text="What is especially concerning, Shaman said, is that there is a two week lag between actions such as reopening and detection of its effects because of the delay in symptoms and hospitalization."/>
						<outline text="Researchers at the Center for Infectious Disesease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota issued a report Thursday that suggested the pandemic would last 18 to 24 months, reappearing in waves of varying intensity."/>
						<outline text="On Sunday, Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said efforts to mitigate spread of the virus had helped but not succeeded in quelling its spread. He said on CBS's Face the Nation that the United States faces the possibility of ''persistent spread'' of the virus that could spark a significant outbreak at any time if schools and workplaces ''let down their guard.''"/>
						<outline text="''While mitigation didn't fail, I think it's fair to say that it didn't work as well as we expected. We expected that we would start seeing more significant declines in new cases and deaths around the nation at this point, and we're just not seeing that,'' Gottlieb said."/>
						<outline text="The largest number of deaths in the United States in a single day since the pandemic began occurred on April 21, when 2,874 people died. (A total of 6,147 deaths were reported on April 14, but they included New York City adding more than 3,000 probable deaths to the daily total.)"/>
						<outline text="To date, 1.16 million people have been infected by the coronavirus and more than 67,000 have died. Both figures are widely believed to undercount the actual totals."/>

						<outline text="More than twice as many people in the US may die of coronavirus, according to a new model that is frequently used by the White House, as health officials revise projections amid fears recently relaxed quarantine measures and expired stay-at-home orders could extend the epidemic in many states through the summer."/>
						<outline text="The University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) projects 134,475 US deaths, with a range of 95,092 to 242,890, up to early August, based on a report released on 4 May."/>
						<outline text="Its report follows a similar projection from federal officials, first obtained by The New York Times, showing a daily death toll increase from Covid-19 to as many as 3,000 per day by 1 June."/>
						<outline text="Download the new Independent Premium appSharing the full story, not just the headlines"/>
						<outline text="The White House has disputed the findings, claiming that the report has not been vetted by the coronavirus task force and is ''not reflective of any of the modelling done by the task force or data that the task force has analysed''."/>
						<outline text="But the sharp rise in the projected death toll in both reports reflects what health officials have feared as the country looks to ''reopen'' local economies in the middle of the public health crisis."/>
						<outline text="IHME attributes the doublings of its numbers to the ''rising mobility in most US states as well as the easing of social distancing measures'' within the next few weeks."/>
						<outline text="''Growing contacts among people will promote transmission of the coronavirus,'' the university said. ''Increases in testing and contact tracing, along with warming seasonal temperatures '' factors that could help slow transmission '' do not offset rising mobility, thereby fuelling a significant increase in projected deaths.''"/>
						<outline text="IHME director Christopher Murray said that the ''evolution of the epidemic'' relies on the balance within each state of its social distancing efforts along with warming weather, testing rates and contact tracing efforts."/>
						<outline text="''We expect that the epidemic in many states will now extend through the summer,'' he said."/>
						<outline text="In March, the university's model initially estimated fewer than 161,000 total deaths in the US. That figure was revised in early April to more than 60,000, with a range as high as 126,000."/>

						<outline text="A leaked United Nations memo has warned that up to 2 million people could die of the coronavirus disease in Bangladesh if the government does not take appropriate action to stem the virus in the densely populated country, according to a report from an investigative website."/>
						<outline text="The report published over the weekend by NetraNews, a Sweden-based non-profit news portal covering Bangladesh, came as health officials in the country confirmed only one new infection over the past three days amid criticism that the government had not made adequate preparations to combat the virus."/>
						<outline text="NetraNews quoted the World Health Organization's country chief, Bardan Jung Rana, as saying that the memo ''  titled ''Country Preparedness and Response Plan'' (CPRP V1) '' was written jointly by U.N. agencies, including WHO, the Bangladesh government and development partners."/>
						<outline text="The memo, which appeared to be a draft, reportedly circulated last week among diplomats in Dhaka."/>
						<outline text="''Given the extraordinary human densities in Bangladesh, globally accepted modeling techniques and parameter assumptions forecast the impact of COVID-19 without interventions between half a million up to 2 million lives lost during the epidemic wave.

						<outline text="A draft government report projects covid-19 cases will surge to about 200,000 per day by June 1, a staggering jump that would be accompanied by more than 3,000 deaths each day."/>
						<outline text="The document predicts a sharp increase in both cases and deaths beginning about May 14, according to a copy shared with The Washington Post. The forecast stops at June 1, but shows both daily cases and deaths on an upward trajectory at that point."/>
						<outline text="The White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention disavowed the report, although the slides carry the CDC's logo. The creator of the model said the numbers are unfinished projections shown to the CDC as a work in progress."/>
						<outline text="The work contained a wide range of possibilities and modeling was not complete, according to Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who created the model. He said he didn't know how the update was turned into a slide deck by government officials and shared with news organizations. The data was first reported by the New York Times."/>
						<outline text="''I had no role in the process by which that was presented and shown,'' said Lessler, who added that the data was presented as an ''FYI'' of work still in progress to officials within the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ''It was not in any way intended to be a forecast.''"/>
						<outline text="The estimates showing an increase to 200,000 cases and 3,000 deaths daily are high compared to other epidemiological models. Many models, while not as high, are also predicting increasing cases and deaths as states move to reopen."/>
						<outline text="Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access."/>
						<outline text="Lessler said that while the exact numbers and charts in the draft document may differ from the final results, they do show accurately how covid-19 cases could spiral out of control. He said 100,000 cases per day by the end of the month is within the realm of possibility. Much depends on political decisions being made today."/>
						<outline text="''There are reopening scenarios where it could get out of control very quickly,'' Lessler said."/>
						<outline text="One federal official said the data was presented at a recent briefing for the National Response Coordination Center, a part of FEMA, which coordinates federal support during major incidents and emergencies. The official, who was not authorized to discuss internal government briefings, spoke on the condition of anonymity."/>
						<outline text="It was not immediately clear whether the projections, which also carry the logos of the departments of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, are based on ramped- up testing, the attempt to reopen some states, the time lag between a rise in cases and deaths or some combination of those factors."/>
						<outline text="The White House issued a statement Monday that ''this is not a White House document, nor has it been presented to the Coronavirus Task Force or gone through interagency vetting. This data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the task force, or data that the task force has analyzed."/>
						<outline text="Read the document"/>
						<outline text="''The President's phased guidelines to open up America again are a scientific driven approach that the top health and infectious disease experts in the federal government agreed with. The health of the American people remains President Trump's top priority, and that will continue as we monitor the efforts by states to ease restrictions.''"/>
						<outline text="A spokeswoman for the CDC said the agency did not issue the projections."/>
						<outline text="The forecast is at odds with remarks made Sunday evening by Trump, who said the United States could eventually suffer as many as 100,000 deaths. At 3,000 deaths per day and rising, the national total would quickly outstrip that number if the new report is correct."/>
						<outline text="A senior White House official said the document would not change the White House planning on reopening."/>
						<outline text="White House officials have been relying on other models to make decisions on reopening, including the IHME model and a ''cubic model'' prepared by Trump adviser and economist Kevin Hassett and the Council of Economic Advisers."/>
						<outline text="On Monday, however, the IHME model '-- widely used by states and heavily relied upon in the past by the White House '-- also revised its deaths significantly upward  to reflect the  reopenings in several states."/>
						<outline text="The IHME model '-- created by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington '-- is now estimating that the United States will reach nearly 135,000 deaths by August 1. That number is significantly higher than its mid-April estimate of 60,308 deaths."/>
						<outline text="The IHME's new higher projections ''reflect the effect of premature relaxation of restrictions,'' said its creator Christopher Murray. ''In this era where those mandates are being relaxed, people should be aware the risk of infection is still there.''"/>
						<outline text="The number of deaths estimated by the IHME model by June 1 is still much lower than those in the draft government report. But the IHME model is considered among the more optimistic projections."/>
						<outline text="Even more optimistic than that, however, is the ''cubic model'' prepared by Trump adviser and economist Kevin Hassett. People with knowledge of that model say it  shows deaths dropping precipitously in May '-- and essentially going to zero by May 15."/>
						<outline text="Despite the White House's optimistic rhetoric, experts have warned that the country could be living with a sizable covid-19 case load for some time."/>
						<outline text="''We don't have the testing. We don't have the contract tracing. We can't detect a rebound. It's a really problematic place to be. This is not where we want to be,'' said Jeffrey Shaman, one of the country's leading epidemiologists at Columbia University."/>
						<outline text="What is especially concerning, Shaman said, is that there is a two-week lag between actions such as reopening and detection of its effects because of the delay in symptoms and hospitalization."/>
						<outline text="Researchers at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota issued a report Thursday that suggested the pandemic would last 18 to 24 months, reappearing in waves of varying intensity."/>
						<outline text="On Sunday, Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus had helped but not succeeded in quelling its spread. He said on CBS's Face the Nation that the United States faces the possibility of ''persistent spread'' of the virus that could spark a significant outbreak at any time if schools and workplaces ''let down their guard.''"/>
						<outline text="''While mitigation didn't fail, I think it's fair to say that it didn't work as well as we expected. We expected that we would start seeing more significant declines in new cases and deaths around the nation at this point, and we're just not seeing that,'' Gottlieb said."/>
						<outline text="The largest number of deaths in the United States in a single day since the pandemic began occurred on April 21, when 2,874 people died. (A total of 6,147 deaths were reported on April 14, but they included New York City adding more than 3,000 probable deaths to the daily total.)"/>
						<outline text="To date, 1.16 million people have been infected by the coronavirus and more than 67,000 have died. Both figures are widely believed to undercount the actual totals."/>

						<outline text="Sweden has been the world's Covid-19 outlier, pursuing social distancing but rejecting mandatory lockdown. Schools, bars and restaurants are open '' albeit with strong voluntary social distancing compliance and streets that often look almost as empty as Britain's. Has this been enough? Sweden's public health agency has now published a study of its R number, a metric which the UK is using to judge the success of the lockdown. The UK objective is to push R below one, by which it means it wants the number of new cases to fall. Last week, the UK's R number was estimated at 0.8 (± 0.2 points), a figure described as an achievement of lockdown. But Sweden's reading is 0.85, with a smaller error margin of ±0.02pts."/>
						<outline text="This raises an interesting question: might voluntary lockdowns work just as well? And might they keep the virus at a manageable level with lower social and economic costs?"/>
						<outline text="The UK government has used modelling from Imperial College London, which makes some firm assumptions about lockdown.  Imperial's graph, below,  shows its argument: shielding, voluntary social distancing, even school closures are shown to make very little difference to the spread of the virus (ie, the R number). But lockdown, by contrast, is shown to be a game-changer with the R sinking immediately. This graph below, if taken at face value, makes an open-and-shut case for lockdown. "/>
						<outline text="But is it true? We don't know because &quot;the R&quot; is notoriously difficult to pin down and the UK has not been issuing estimates.  But Imperial also applied its UK assumptions to Sweden, warning that its rejection of lockdown was likely to leave the virus rampant with an R of between 3 and 4. That is to say: every person infected would give it to three or four others. Its modelling envisaged Sweden paying a heavy price for its rejection of lockdown, with 40,000 Covid deaths by 1 May and almost 100,000 by June."/>
						<outline text="The latest figure for Sweden is 2,680 deaths, with daily deaths peaking a fortnight ago. So Imperial College's modelling '' the same modelling used to inform the UK response '' was wrong, by an order of magnitude. Sweden has now published its own graph, saying its R was never near the 4 that Imperial imagined. More importantly, its all-important R level (all-important to the UK anyway '' it has never much featured in the Swedish discussion) has in fact been below the safe level of 1 for the last few weeks."/>
						<outline text="The value of 'the R' is not a known number: it can only be guessed at, because the actual number of infections can only be guessed at. But this is a ball park issue: is this virus growing exponentially, or is it in retreat? Imperial's models said that, without lockdown, the virus would grow exponentially in Sweden. Instead, it fell. Why? "/>
						<outline text="As Johan Norberg has written, Imperial's model 'could only handle two scenarios: an enforced national lockdown or zero change in behaviour. It had no way of computing Swedes who decided to socially distance voluntarily. But we did.'  Anders Tegnell, Sweden's state epidemiologist, has seen his trust ratings soar. Some Swedes are even having his face tattooed on their arm. "/>
						<outline text="When Imperial first made its models, everyone was guessing. We know more now. Every day, in The Spectator's Covid-19 email, we bring new studies that add more detail to our understanding of the virus.  At present, Britain is considering the South Korean model: an ambitious combination of tech, surveillance, track and trace. But given that Sweden achieved what Imperial College had thought undoable, without the surveillance or the tech or the loss of liberty, its lessons are also worthy of consideration. "/>
						<outline text="Sweden's Prime Minister has said he is relying on 'Folkvett' '' people's wit, or common sense. As Boris Johnson considers his options, he should also ask whether a folkvett option '' described in a recent Spectator leading article as a 'trust the public' approach '' might work for Britain. "/>

						<outline text="In my lifetime, there was another deadly flu epidemic in the United States. The flu spread from Hong Kong to the United States, arriving December 1968 and peaking a year later. It ultimately killed 100,000 people in the U.S., mostly over the age of 65, and one million worldwide."/>
						<outline text="Lifespan in the US in those days was 70 whereas it is 78 today. Population was 200 million as compared with 328 million today. It was also a healthier population with low obesity. If it would be possible to extrapolate the death data based on population and demographics, we might be looking at a quarter million deaths today from this virus. So in terms of lethality, it was as deadly and scary as COVID-19 if not more so, though we shall have to wait to see."/>

John Fund has a friend who reports having attended a Grateful Dead concert. In fact, people have no memory or awareness that the famous Woodstock concert of August 1969 '' planned in January during the worse period of death '' actually occurred during a deadly American flu pandemic that only peaked globally six months later. There was no thought given to the virus which, like ours today, was dangerous mainly for a non-concert-going demographic."/>
						<outline text="Stock markets didn't crash. Congress passed no legislation. The Federal Reserve did nothing. Not a single governor acted to enforce social distancing, curve flattening (even though hundreds of thousands of people were hospitalized), or banning of crowds. No mothers were arrested for taking their kids to other homes. No surfers were arrested. No daycares were shut even though there were more infant deaths with this virus than the one we are experiencing now. There were no suicides, no unemployment, no drug overdoses."/>
						<outline text="Media covered the pandemic but it never became a big issue."/>
						<outline text="As Bojan Pancevski in the Wall Street Journal points out, ''In 1968-70, news outlets devoted cursory attention to the virus while training their lenses on other events such as the moon landing and the Vietnam War, and the cultural upheaval of the civil-rights movements, student protests and the sexual revolution.''"/>
						<outline text="The only actions governments took was to collect data, watch and wait, encourage testing and vaccines, and so on. The medical community took the primary responsibility for disease mitigation, as one might expect. It was widely assumed that diseases require medical not political responses."/>
						<outline text="It's not as if we had governments unwilling to intervene in other matters. We had the Vietnam War, social welfare, public housing, urban renewal, and the rise of Medicare and Medicaid. We had a president swearing to cure all poverty, illiteracy, and disease. Government was as intrusive as it had ever been in history. But for some reason, there was no thought given to shutdowns."/>
						<outline text="Which raises the question: why was this different? We will be trying to figure this one out for decades."/>
						<outline text="Was the difference that we have mass media invading our lives with endless notifications blowing up in our pockets? Was there some change in philosophy such that we now think politics is responsible for all existing aspects of life? Was there a political element here in that the media blew this wildly out of proportion as revenge against Trump and his deplorables? Or did our excessive adoration of predictive modelling get out of control to the point that we let a physicist with ridiculous models frighten the world's governments into violating the human rights of billions of people?"/>
						<outline text="Maybe all of these were factors. Or maybe there is something darker and nefarious at work, as the conspiracy theorists would have it."/>
						<outline text="Regardless, they all have some explaining to do."/>
						<outline text="By way of personal recollection, my own mother and father were part of a generation that believed they had developed sophisticated views of viruses. They understood that less vulnerable people getting them not only strengthened immune systems but contributed to disease mitigation by reaching ''herd immunity.'' They had a whole protocol to make a child feel better about being sick. I got a ''sick toy,'' unlimited ice cream, Vicks rub on my chest, a humidifier in my room, and so on."/>
						<outline text="They would constantly congratulate me on building immunity. They did their very best to be happy about my viruses, while doing their best to get me through them."/>
						<outline text="If we used government lockdowns then like we use them now, Woodstock (which changed music forever and still resonates today) would never have occurred. How much prosperity, culture, tech, etc. are losing in this calamity?"/>
						<outline text="What happened between then and now? Was there some kind of lost knowledge, as happened with scurvy, when we once had sophistication and then the knowledge was lost and had to be re-found? For COVID-19, we reverted to medieval-style understandings and policies, even in the 21st century. It's all very strange."/>
						<outline text="The contrast between 1968 and 2020 couldn't be more striking. They were smart. We are idiots. Or at least our governments are."/>

						<outline text="Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday sharply criticized two Northern California counties that have defied his health guidelines and begun to re-open restaurant dining rooms, gyms, hair salons and shopping malls."/>
						<outline text="''They are making a big mistake. They are putting their public at risk,'' Newsom said of Yuba and Sutter counties. ''They are putting our progress at risk. These are exceptions. The overwhelming majority of Californians are playing by the rules and doing the right thing.''"/>
						<outline text="The issue highlights the latest example of local communities bucking Newsom and state public health leaders' orders as the coronavirus pandemic drags on, and the delicate balancing act he is trying to perform between limiting the spread of the disease while governing a huge state with 40 million residents and dramatically different economies, politics and rates of COVID-19."/>
						<outline text="The two counties, north of Sacramento, are mostly rural. Yuba County has 72,000 residents and Sutter County about 95,000. Combined, they have 50 reported cases of COVID-19 and three deaths. By contrast, the Bay Area, with more than 7 million residents, 9,118 cases and 330 deaths, has more stringent rules that generally allow only ''essential'' businesses, including supermarkets, banks and gas stations, to operate."/>
						<outline text="Last week, the health officer for both Yuba and Sutter, Dr. Phuong Luu, issued a new health order that allowed a much wider range of businesses to open than nearly every other county in California. The new rules took effect Monday."/>
						<outline text="''COVID-19 is dangerous and scary but it is not the only health issue,'' Luu said in a statement Monday. ''We cannot wait for a vaccine without seeing extreme economic damage done to our community. The consequences of waiting will be additional health concerns brought on by stress and the very real dilemma for those with limited resources whether to buy life-saving food or life-saving medicines. As the bi-county health officer, I have to think of the totality of health for the entire community.''"/>
						<outline text="Luu's order allows dine-in restaurants, retail operations, shopping malls, construction, real estate businesses, gyms and fitness studios, hair salons and barbershops, nail salons, spas, massage-therapy centers and tattoo parlors in the two counties to operate as long as they follow safety guidelines and draw up a plan to keep customers at least six feet apart and require employees to regularly clean and disinfect."/>
						<outline text="The number of COVID-19 cases in the two counties ''has plateaued'' for the past three weeks, she said."/>
						<outline text="Asked about the major loosening of rules at his Tuesday news conference, Newsom said the plans are premature and dangerous."/>
						<outline text="''They put those businesses at risk and the health of their communities at risk,'' the governor said."/>
						<outline text="''We believe in ready aim fire, not ready fire aim,'' he added."/>
						<outline text="But leaders in the two outlier counties defended the decision to open."/>
						<outline text="''In the North State, our communities have met the scientific criteria for re-opening, and we're not going to wait for San Francisco and Los Angeles in order to re-open,'' said Assemblyman James Gallagher, R-Yuba City. ''If this is truly about science and not politics, the governor shouldn't push back against local public health officers.''"/>
						<outline text="Despite his criticism of the two counties Tuesday, Newsom did not indicate whether there will be any state enforcement of his shelter-in-place rules or other consequences for local communities that violate his orders."/>
						<outline text="''I think he's hoping that persuasion works,'' said Jack Pitney, a professor of political science at Claremont McKenna College. ''Heavy-handed enforcement could itself be unpopular. If it's not enough, he has yet another difficult choice. What does he do by way of consequence? I don't envy his job right now.''"/>
						<outline text="Modoc County, located in remote northeastern California on the Oregon border, allowed businesses, schools and churches to reopen Friday. The county, with 10,000 residents, has not reported a single case of coronavirus."/>
						<outline text="That's not the case statewide. On Tuesday, there were 58,657 cases statewide '-- including 2,546 new cases, the most ever in one day '-- and 9,118 in the greater Bay Area. There also were 93 new deaths reported in California on Tuesday, bringing the total number statewide to 2,375, according to data compiled by this news organization."/>
						<outline text="Generally speaking, Californians support the shelter-in-place rules, polls show. A survey of 8,800 registered state voters released Friday by the UC Berkeley Institute of Government Studies found that by 69%-30% Californians said they are more concerned about the health effects of ending the shelter-in-place rules too soon than the economic effects."/>
						<outline text="California put in place shelter-at-home rules before other states and has a lower death rate than other states. Newsom reiterated Tuesday that he plans to announce new rules later this week to allow more businesses statewide, including bookstores, florists, clothing stores and sporting goods stores, to re-open starting Friday, as long as they make sales at the curbside, have employees wear masks and take other precautions. The announcement does not include offices, seated dining at restaurants, or shopping malls or schools. And county health officers still will be allowed to keep tighter restrictions in place if they feel they are needed."/>
						<outline text="Newsom noted Tuesday that as stores and other businesses open across the state in the coming days and weeks, Californians should be prepared for a different experience."/>
						<outline text="''We're not going back to normal,'' Newsom said. ''It's a new normal with adaptations and modifications, until we get to immunity and a vaccine.''"/>
						<outline text="Last week, after seeing images of big crowds on Southern California beaches, Newsom administration officials considered closing every beach in California and all 280 state parks. After reportedly receiving push back from Democratic elected officials, he announced that only beaches in Orange County would be closed, a move that set off lawsuits and protests there."/>
						<outline text="Tuesday, Newsom announced his administration had reached a compromise with three Orange County cities '-- Huntington Beach, Seal Beach and Dana Point '-- to re-open their beaches. It came a day after similar compromises were worked out with officials in Laguna Beach and San Clemente to open beaches, but only during limited hours, and if beachgoers were walking, running or otherwise exercising."/>
						<outline text="''It's the spirit of collaboration and cooperation that's necessary as we move forward,'' he said."/>
						<outline text="The governor added, however, that people should continue to wear face masks, wash their hands and practice social distancing, in part because many people who have COVID-19 don't always have symptoms, particularly at first."/>
						<outline text="''I think we can continue this progress as long as we continue to take seriously this virus,'' he said."/>
						<outline text="''You may be young and healthy, but if you run up and give grandma a big hug, and all of a sudden, five or six days later, grandma is in the ICU.''"/>
						<outline text="''Let's not develop amnesia,'' he added. ''Let's not run a 90-year dash.''"/>

						<outline text="Citizens from just seven out of 23 countries rate their governments' coronavirus containment measures as broadly positive, based on the &quot;Global Crisis Perceptions&quot; index released Wednesday by insights agencies Blackbox Research and Toluna."/>
						<outline text="The research, which surveyed approximately 12,500 people across 23 countries between April 3 and 19, asked respondents to rate their nations across four key indicators: national political leadership, corporate leadership, community and media."/>
						<outline text="China, where the virus is thought to have originated, ranked highest in the citizens' survey, with a score of 85 out of 100. The world's second-largest economy was followed by Vietnam (77), the United Arab Emirates (59) and India (59), in a list which saw Asian countries take the top spots."/>
						<outline text="New Zealand (56), which has received international acclaim for its handling of the virus and last week began easing restrictions, was the only Western country to score higher than the global average of 45.

						<outline text="&quot;For many of these countries, this pandemic is unprecedented. Governments are still coming to terms with a crisis they did not expect, and public confidence suffered as a result,&quot; said Black."/>

						<outline text="DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Coronavirus test kits used in Tanzania were dismissed as faulty by President John Magufuli on Sunday, because he said they had returned positive results on samples taken from a goat and a pawpaw."/>
						<outline text="Magufuli, whose government has already drawn criticism for being secretive about the coronavirus outbreak and has previously asked Tanzanians to pray the coronavirus away, said the kits had ''technical errors''."/>
						<outline text="The COVID-19 testing kits had been imported from abroad, Magufuli said during an event in Chato in the north west of Tanzania, although he did not give further details."/>
						<outline text="The president said he had instructed Tanzanian security forces to check the quality of the kits. They had randomly obtained several non-human samples, including from a pawpaw, a goat and a sheep, but had assigned them human names and ages."/>
						<outline text="These samples were then submitted to Tanzania's laboratory to test for the coronavirus, with the lab technicians left deliberately unaware of their origins."/>
						<outline text="Samples from the pawpaw and the goat tested positive for COVID-19, the president said, adding this meant it was likely that some people were being tested positive when in fact they were not infected by the coronavirus."/>
						<outline text="''There is something happening. I said before we should not accept that every aid is meant to be good for this nation,'' Magufuli said, adding the kits should be investigated."/>
						<outline text="As of Sunday, Tanzania had recorded 480 cases of COVID-19 and 17 deaths but unlike most other African countries, Dar es Salaam sometimes goes for days without offering updates, with the last bulletin on cases on Wednesday."/>
						<outline text="Slideshow  (2 Images)  Magufuli also said that he was sending a plane to collect a cure being promoted by Madagascar's president. The herbal mix has not yet undergone internationally recognised scientific testing."/>

						<outline text="NEW YORK (AP) '-- A New York City police officer who was caught on video Saturday pointing a stun gun at a man and violently taking him to the ground over an alleged social distancing violation has been stripped of his gun and badge and placed on desk duty pending an internal investigation."/>
						<outline text="Bystander video showed the plainclothes officer, who was not wearing a protective face mask, slapping 33-year-old Donni Wright in the face, punching him in the shoulder and dragging him to a sidewalk after leveling him in a crosswalk in Manhattan's East Village."/>
						<outline text="''The behavior I saw in that video is simply not acceptable,'' Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted Sunday. He said earlier in the day that there will be a careful look into what happened."/>
						<outline text="Police spokeswoman Sgt. Mary Frances O'Donnell said Wright ''took a fighting stance against the officer'' when he was ordered to disperse and was arrested on charges including assault on a police officer and resisting arrest."/>
						<outline text="The charges have been deferred pending further investigation, a Manhattan District Attorney's Office spokesperson said."/>
						<outline text="A message seeking comment was left with the police officers union."/>
						<outline text="Wright's arrest and that of two other people minutes earlier on the same block across from a public housing complex raised new questions about the police department's use of force, the role of officers in enforcing social distancing measures and inconsistency in how they're applied."/>
						<outline text="The manner of Wright's arrest appeared to echo that of 20-year-old Fitzroy Gayle, who was seen on bystander video pleading for help as several officers wrestled him into submission on a Brooklyn sidewalk in early March."/>
						<outline text="Jennvine Wong, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society's Cop Accountability Project, said footage of the arrests Saturday stood in sharp contrast to photos and video '-- including some tweeted out by the police department '-- showing officers in crowded city parks handing out face masks and gently reminding people to stay 6 feet apart."/>
						<outline text="''This certainly isn't the first time and this isn't even the first time in this pandemic that we've seen evidence of discriminatory policing by the NYPD,'' Wong said."/>
						<outline text="Carolyn Martinez-Class, of the police watchdog Communities United for Police Reform, said: ''This incident illustrates why public health professions and community partners should be responsible for social distancing education and creating norms '-- not police.''"/>
						<outline text="The police department assigned 1,000 officers to social distancing patrols over the weekend as temperatures reached the high 70s (about 25 degrees Celsius). On Saturday, they issued 51 summonses, including 43 in city parks. At a news conference Sunday, Shea said he was aware of just three arrests."/>
						<outline text="Minutes before the confrontation with Wright, video from a nearby security camera showed officers used force in arresting a couple for allegedly failing to comply when asked to disperse. O'Donnell said officers saw that one of them, a 31-year-old man, had a ''bag of alleged marijuana in plain view.''"/>
						<outline text="The bystander video of Wright's arrest showed the plainclothes officer, Francisco Garcia, helping take one of those people to the ground before turning his attention to Wright, who was moving toward the area of that arrest from about 10 to 15 feet away."/>
						<outline text="Garcia '-- in a black T-shirt, jeans and a Yankees cap '-- turned toward Wright and cursed at him to ''(get) back right now,'' according to the video. At the same time, the officer pulls up his Taser and points it toward Wright, possibly triggering the device."/>
						<outline text="Garcia continued toward Wright and eventually holstered his Taser. It wasn't clear what Wright was doing because he wasn't in the frame the entire time, though just before Garcia tackled him, he was seen stopping and standing in front of the officer with what appeared to be a clenched fist at his side."/>
						<outline text="''What you flexing for? Don't flex,'' Garcia said, before grabbing Wright and wrestling him to the ground, slapping and punching him in the process. The officer then took Wright's arm and dragged him from the crosswalk where he landed back onto the sidewalk and pushed him onto his stomach."/>
						<outline text="The video then showed another officer stepping in and helping handcuff Wright."/>
						<outline text="Kneeling on the top of Wright's back or neck to keep him down, the plainclothes officer started jawing and cursing at bystanders."/>
						<outline text="One of them yelled back: ''he didn't even do nothing.''"/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="The scale of the intrusion of technology into our lives is now so extensive and complex that it is near impossible for individuals to grasp'' and some nervous technologists are starting to sound an awful lot like Ted Kaczynski"/>
						<outline text="But for the series Manhunt: Unabomber, currently playing on Netflix, few people under the age of 60 would have heard of Ted Kaczynski and the 17-year campaign of terror he waged against what he saw as the runaway Frankenstein's monster of technological progress."/>
						<outline text="There is some irony here. Kaczynski dismissed television as ''an important psychological tool of the system'', designed to control the masses '' but now the box-set generation has been introduced to his murderous mission to halt what he believed was the erosion of human freedom and dignity by our unthinking embrace of technology."/>
						<outline text="This year marks the 40th anniversary of the start of that campaign. Between 1978 and 1995 the Harvard-educated maths genius, who became known to the FBI as the Unabomber, planted 16 bombs, killing three people and injuring 23 more. Most of his targets were involved with technology, albeit to varying degrees. He was caught only when the New York Times and Washington Post agreed to publish his 35,000-word manifesto called Industrial Society and its Future and its themes were recognised by his brother, who turned him in."/>
						<outline text="Kaczynski, who had retreated to an off-grid cabin in Montana to plot the overthrow of technological society, was quite literally the proverbial voice in the wilderness. Forty years on, however, it could be argued that the Unabomber was a visionary to whom we should all now be paying very close attention indeed."/>
						<outline text="Of course, it goes against the grain to credit a killer. But as Dr David Skrbina, a philosophy lecturer at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, puts it: ''The challenge is to make a firm separation between the Unabomber crimes and a rational, in-depth, no-holds-barred discussion of the threat posed by modern technology''. Kaczynski, says Dr Skrbina, ''has much to offer to this discussion [and] his ideas have no less force, simply because they issue from a maximum security cell''."/>
						<outline text="If anything, technological developments in the world outside that cell in the past 40 years have served only to reinforce Kaczynski's message. Take the so-called ''transhumanism'' movement, with futurists such as Ray Kurzweil gleefully herding us towards the dystopian surrender of our humanity, to a hybrid amalgamation of artificial intelligence and flesh and blood '' the so-called singularity, upon us as soon as 2029, according to Google's blue-sky thinker. This was a theme embraced by electric-cars-to-rockets multi-billionaire Elon Musk at the World Government Summit in Dubai last year. In the fast-approaching era of artificial intelligence, he proclaimed, human beings must merge with machines or become obsolete."/>
						<outline text="In his manifesto, Kaczynski wrote cogently of his fear that ''the technophiles are taking us all on an utterly reckless ride'' and that technology ''will eventually acquire something approaching complete control over human behaviour''. He was especially fearful of the rise of artificial intelligence '' a concern shared today by thinkers including the cosmologist Stephen Hawking. ''A super-intelligent AI,'' Professor Hawking has warned, ''will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals and if those goals aren't aligned with ours, we're in trouble.''"/>
						<outline text="Kaczynski was way ahead of him. Twenty years earlier, he predicted that computer scientists would ''succeed in developing intelligent machines that can do all things better than human beings. As society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and as machines become more and more intelligent, people will let machines make more and more of their decisions for them''."/>
						<outline text="Eventually ''the decisions necessary to keep the system running will be so complex that human beings will be incapable of making them intelligently'', at which stage ''the machines will be in effective control''. People won't be able to turn off the machines &quot;because they will be so dependent on them that turning them off would amount to suicide''."/>
						<outline text="Think of the astonishing and largely unforeseen technological developments that have taken place and the ethical and social dilemmas many of them are now posing, in the 40 years since Kaczynski made his first bomb: the internet, the personal computer, supercomputer, tablet, smartphone, mass surveillance, GPS, email, wifi, broadband, nanotechnology, genetic engineering, robotics, wearables, drones, autonomous vehicles '' to name a few."/>
						<outline text="Then there's the rise of giants like Google, Facebook and Twitter, tracking and harvesting every facet of our digital lives, to say nothing of the Trojan horse toys we willingly bring into our homes, such as Amazon's Echo and Google's Home '' always listening, increasingly watching and constantly learning about you and your habits."/>
						<outline text="Consider Kaczynski's observation that ''if the use of a new item of technology is initially optional, it does not necessarily remain optional because the new technology tends to change society in such a way that it becomes difficult or impossible for an individual to function without using that technology''. Now contrast that with the declaration by the United Nations that access to the internet is nothing less than an inalienable human right, right up there with food, shelter and education."/>
						<outline text="Which of this doesn't chime with Kaczynski's fear that the human race might ''drift into a position of such dependence on the machines that it would have no practical choice but to accept all of the machines' decisions'', at which point ''the human race would be at the mercy of the machines''?"/>
						<outline text="The scale of the intrusion of technology into our lives is now so extensive and complex that it is near impossible for individuals to grasp. But some technologists, at least, are starting to wonder if it isn't all getting out of hand '' and in the process are beginning to sound an awful lot like Kaczynski."/>
						<outline text="Last week the San Francisco-based Centre for Humane Technology, a group of ''deeply concerned former tech insiders'', launched a campaign to ''realign technology with humanity's best interests''. Technology, it announced, ''is hijacking our minds and '... eroding the pillars of our society: mental health, democracy, social relationships and our children''."/>

						<outline text="Judy Mikovits, Ph.D. is a cellular and molecular biologist,1  researcher and was the founding research director of the Whittemore Peterson Institute that researches and treats chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) in Reno, Nevada."/>
						<outline text="She is likely one of the most qualified scientists in the world to comment on this disease because of her groundbreaking research in molecular biology and virology."/>
						<outline text="Mikovits is absolutely brilliant, but like many gifted researchers, her complex discussions on science quite challenging for the average lay person to follow."/>
						<outline text="For this reason, I present her interview in a different format, cutting and splicing pieces together to present a more cohesive and coherent presentation of her many important points. I would encourage you to watch the initial, very short, videos first, so you will be well-grounded, and if you are motivated, watch the entire interview at the bottom of this article."/>
						<outline text="Because there were so many surprising and important revelations in this interview I will present part 2 next week along with an interview with Bobby Kennedy, Jr which will revolve more on the vaccine issue."/>
						<outline text="Mikovits Doesn't Believe SARS-CoV-2 Is the Cause of COVID-19One of the most shocking revelations Mikovits reveals is that she doesn't believe SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of COVID-19 but merely serves to activate or wake up a dormant XMRV infection. To support her assertion, she states that COVID-19 patients have the same cytokine signature as the gammaretrovirus XMRV, which she published many years ago."/>
						<outline text="XMRV stands for ''xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus.'' Xenotrophic refers to viruses that only replicate in cells other than those of the host species. So, XMRVs are viruses that infect human cells yet are not human viruses.2"/>
						<outline text="The XMRV retrovirus is actually the virus that has the same cytokine storm signature as COVID-19, not coronaviruses, which are far more benign. (I delve into what retroviruses are in another section further below.)"/>
						<outline text="Additionally, there may be other infections that also are contributing to the infection, such as Borelia and Babesia or parasites, which may be why some of the antiparasite drugs like Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine are working."/>
						<outline text="Vaccine Gammaretroviruses Have Adapted and Are AerosolizedGetting back to the issue of gammaretroviruses, Mikovits research showed that many of our vaccines are contaminated with them. How did this happen? In short, vaccine viruses were replicated and grown in animal cell cultures that were already contaminated with retroviruses. In other words, the root of the problem stems from the use of contaminated cell culture lines."/>
						<outline text="Vaccine manufacturing frequently involves the use of animal tissues and many vaccines are grown animal culture cell lines. As noted in the 2010 paper, ''Of Mice and Men: On the Origin of XMRV,'' published in Frontiers in Microbiology (which Mikovits did not work on):3"/>
						<outline text="''The novel human retrovirus xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is arguably the most controversial virus of this moment. After its original discovery in prostate cancer tissue from North American patients, it was subsequently detected in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome from the same continent '..."/>
						<outline text="The detection of integrated XMRV proviruses in prostate cancer tissue proves it to be a genuine virus that replicates in human cells, leaving the question: how did XMRV enter the human population?"/>
						<outline text="We will discuss two possible routes: either via direct virus transmission from mouse to human '... or via the use of mouse-related products by humans, including vaccines. We hypothesize that mouse cells or human cell lines used for vaccine production could have been contaminated with a replicating variant of the XMRV precursors encoded by the mouse genome.''"/>
						<outline text="Mikovits goes even further, explaining that, ''It became clear in 2011 that these [gammaretro]viruses had adapted to become aerosolized.'' This is a rather shocking finding, and this, Mikovits says, is what allows the gammaretroviruses to spread in laboratories from one cell line to another."/>
						<outline text="This could be related to research catalyzed by Charles Lieber, the former head of Harvard's chemistry department, who is a nanoscience experts and was arrested by federal authorities earlier this year for working with the Wuhan Virology Institute."/>
						<outline text="Lab workers may also be inadvertently spreading them as they are using cell lines contaminated with retroviruses in vaccine production that could result in the spread of these retroviruses via the finished vaccine. Mikovits suspects COVID-19 may in fact be a type of vaccine-derived or vaccine-induced retroviral infection."/>
						<outline text="''I don't believe [COVID-19] is infection from without,'' she says. ''I believe the spread across [210] countries4  is from injection, and there's enough evidence to support that.''"/>
						<outline text="Advertisement"/>
						<outline text="SARS-CoV-2 '-- A Combination of SARS, Gammaretroviruses and HIVAnother of her theories is that SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to have had a zoonotic origin but is likely synthetically produced. She believes it originated in and escaped or leaked from a biosafety laboratory. Mikovits believes both scenarios might be at play, where a lab-created virus, SARS-CoV-2, is causing serious infection and/or death only in those who have underlying retroviruses in their bodies."/>
						<outline text="Mikovits suspects that people who do not have retroviral infections, SARS-CoV-2 causes no or only mild symptoms. Another possibility is that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the result of growing coronaviruses in retrovirus-contaminated cell lines, producing a gammaretrovirus-carrying virus. According to Mikovits, her 2009 through 2011 work suggested 25 million to 30 million Americans were carriers of XMRVs and other gammaretroviruses. That estimate is over a decade old now so the number is likely far higher."/>
						<outline text="''There is a family of gammaretroviruses, most likely [in] contaminated blood supply and vaccines that are still to this day, almost 10 years later, being injected,'' she says."/>
						<outline text="''We don't need an infectious virus if you inject the blueprint, if you inject the provirus. And '... there are a lot of data to support COVID-19 is not SARS-CoV-2 alone, that it's SARS-CoV-2 and XMRVs (human gammaretroviruses) and HIV.''"/>
						<outline text="Might Wearing a Mask Worsen Your Odds of Illness?Mikovits is also highly critical of the recommendation (and in some places mandate) to wear a face mask or fabric cover such as a bandana around your face. She believes:"/>
						<outline text="''Wearing a mask is going to cause more secretions and give more cells a home and amplify any viruses. [Wearing a mask is] immune suppressive; it's going to limit your body's ability to produce Type 1 interferon."/>
						<outline text="You're driving the infection in yourself and you're not preventing the spread. [Instead], you're amplifying [replication of] not just [SARS-CoV-2] but also many other [viruses], including your XMRVs, influenza or other dormant viruses."/>
						<outline text="What keeps those dormant viruses dormant? Your natural killer (NK) cells, your mast cells, your macrophages. That's where you're getting the inflammatory signature."/>
						<outline text="So, every virus you amplify is driving the inflammatory signature, and you're going to get sick. [The resulting illness] doesn't have to be SARS-CoV-2 at all. You're making yourself sick [by bringing dormant viruses out of dormancy]. It's insanity.''"/>
						<outline text="Wearing a face mask after getting a live flu vaccine may further worsen your odds, she says. Why? Because you're injecting three or more live flu virus strains into your body, which lowers your immune function. You're also going to shed the viruses contained in the vaccine. If you wear a mask, Mikovits says, you'll shed those viruses into the mask, which could encourage illness."/>
						<outline text="On the other hand, not wearing one might jeopardize the health of others. ''If you're shedding [the viruses] into the air, you're going to make somebody else get another upper respiratory infection that's going to allow [SARS-CoV-2] to make them sicker,'' she warns."/>
						<outline text="Why PCR Testing Is a Bad IdeaWe're also being lied to about the prevalence of infection. We're seeing inflated case numbers for the simple reason that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention no longer requires doctors to do testing in order to confirm that a patient is in fact infected with SARS-CoV-2 or died from COVID-19. The numbers now include ''suspected'' and ''assumed'' cases."/>
						<outline text="Naturally, without widespread and accurate testing, there's no way to get a clear idea of how prevalent the infection is, and how many actually get sick and die from it. The initial emphasis on PCR testing resulted in massive false positives and greatly inflated numbers of those infected."/>
						<outline text="As noted by Mikovits, confirming each case through testing matters greatly, as there are hundreds, if not thousands, of microbes that can cause upper respiratory infections, including seasonal influenza viruses. None of those should be lumped in with COVID-19 if we want to understand the true nature and danger of this disease."/>
						<outline text="What's more, the initial decision to use RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) testing instead of antibody testing was an unwise one, as it virtually guaranteed an overestimation of the problem. RT-PCR is now being used to diagnose an active infection by detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material.5  However, by doing that, you end up with high rates of false positives. Mikovits explains how the RT-PCR test works:"/>
						<outline text="''We're taking a swab and scraping some epithelial cells [from the back of the sinuses or throat] because that's what coronaviruses infect '... We get a little RNA '-- because it's an RNA virus '-- we reverse-transcribe that, meaning write it backwards with enzymes in the lab, and then we amplify it [through a] polymerase chain reaction '..."/>
						<outline text="We're only taking a piece of the virus, we're not taking the whole virus '... The first thing about [the PCR] test is, it was admitted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the CDC that the tests put out by the CDC were contaminated."/>
						<outline text="And when you amplify something a million times, or 10 million times '-- whatever they do in the 30 cycles or so '-- it's logarithmic that RNA then is way overestimated '... [But] no [viral] particle was identified or isolated from your saliva or from your nasal passages. Nobody took the secretions from your nose or your mouth and isolated the [actual] viruses."/>
						<outline text="[When I isolated] HIV in 1983, I isolated it from saliva. What you do is you take the virus and grow it in any human cell, in an appropriate cell line, and you make many copies. [Viral replication] means you have [a positive test for] that virus. Then you sequence the whole virus."/>
						<outline text="A PCR [test, on the other hand] can give you a lot of false positives [by amplifying RNA fragments]."/>
						<outline text="We [also] showed the people that had [HIV] infection had antibodies; that they had been fully exposed and it was not a piece of nucleic acid in a biopsy or in their throat or in their nose. [A piece of nucleic acid] is not a virus. And it's certainly not infectious."/>
						<outline text="If RNA is there and in the tiniest amount, I'm not going to cough it on somebody, especially if I'm not coughing. I'm not going to breathe that [out and infect] somebody because there's no evidence of an infectious virus.''"/>
						<outline text="Better Testing Strategy: AntibodiesRather than using PCR testing, ''what should have been done is test for antibodies,'' Mikovits says. This is what was done in South Korea. An antibody test will tell you whether you had the infection at some point, and have developed a strong immune response or immunological memory that will allow you to fight the infection should you encounter it again."/>
						<outline text="''Epidemiology is not done with PCR. In fact, Kary Mullis who invented PCR, Nobel Laureate, and others, said PCR was never intended for diagnostic testing. So that puts that to bed."/>
						<outline text="It takes nothing to develop a really good serology [i.e., antibody] test '... [It takes] a few weeks. It's pretty easy because the people who have recovered have antibodies. So, you isolate those antibodies, you take their plasma, you purify the antibodies, and then you can grow them."/>
						<outline text="Then you develop the tests'... It's usually ELISA or Western Blot [which check for] the protein and the antibody binds. You form an immune complex, and you detect it with a dye. You can do that test with a finger stick '... and it takes 15 minutes to get the answer, almost like a pregnancy test.''"/>
						<outline text="My belief is that the use of PCR instead of a proper antibody test was intentional, as it inflates the case numbers. Mikovits agrees, saying ''I wouldn't get any tests right now. I'd simply wash my hands and drink hot lemon water as I always do for any flu season.''"/>
						<outline text="Evidence SARS-CoV-2 May Be a Lab-Created VirusIn the Epoch Times documentary, ''Tracking Down the Origin of the Wuhan Coronavirus,'' Mikovits details some of the evidence supporting the view that SARS-CoV-2 is not a naturally-evolved virus, but rather a laboratory concoction."/>
						<outline text="One piece of evidence is that the virus contains a protein envelope from the HIV virus. It's also very similar to SARS which, according to bioweapons expert Francis Boyle, is an engineered bioweapon."/>
						<outline text="As explained by Mikovits, an Indian paper6 ,7  detailed the presence of Gp120, a protein envelope from the HIV virus. That paper was quickly retracted due to political pressure. However, Mikovits colleague, Luc Montagnier, made a similar discovery, finding Gp41 in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is the transmembrane domain of the HIV virus."/>
						<outline text="''The folks from India also had GAG. That's structural proteins. That gives you a clue that it wasn't a CRISPR technique or a pseudotyping where the envelope was expressed in a gene therapy-type of way. If it were CRISPR, you wouldn't put the GAG sequences in there."/>
						<outline text="What was done is, the virus was acquired as they grew SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells '-- the monkey kidney cells where you get HIV."/>
						<outline text="Simian immune deficiency virus was the origin, and we were told all the way back in the 80s that somebody forgot to cook their food in Africa and a few promiscuous men spread this [HIV] virus around the world. So, you can see again the patterns of the lies and of what people end up believing.''"/>
						<outline text="The addition of this envelope protein from HIV gives SARS-CoV-2 the ability to impair the immune system. It also contributes to its pathogenicity. Mikovits continues her explanation:"/>
						<outline text="''The first thing is, you must grow a virus to make a lot of it. So, you grow it in cell lines. They didn't take [SARS-CoV-2] from the bat and it jumped into a human. It normally goes through another cell [from] a monkey or a smaller animal. The cell line that supports the growth and expansion [of viruses] are monkey kidney cells."/>
						<outline text="Maybe [SARS-CoV-2] is not engineered at all '... but the end result is, now it not only infects the epithelial cells of the lungs, it infects the white blood cells, it infects the immune cells. We see the splenomegaly in large spleens, we're seeing penias, cytopenias. We're losing cells like HIV-killing T-cells '..."/>
						<outline text="So, it's got not only an expanded host range, but also disease symptoms that make no sense for a coronavirus. Hence, we're killing people because they're treating an upper respiratory infection, and you're getting that inflammatory disease signature because you're infecting the very innate immune response, the macrophages, the monocytes, the natural killer cells, the T cells. And it's primarily the T-cells in the macrophages because those are the cells HIV 120 and Gp41 infect through CCR5 in the CD4 receptor."/>
						<outline text="So now you're going to lose your adaptive immune response, you're going to drive the inflammation. And it's the fire [of inflammation] that does the tissue damage.''"/>
						<outline text="Another piece that hints at SARS-CoV-2 being a manufactured virus is the construction of its spike proteins, which bind to ACE2 receptors to gain access into the cell. This appears to be an engineering feature. According to Mikovits, it's quite clear that the spike proteins came from the original SARS virus, which also infects through ACE receptors."/>
						<outline text="There are also ''single point mutations there that make it far more infectious, easier to spread,'' she says, ''and how those were acquired, nobody really can say.'' At least not yet. Nanotechnology may also have been used to aerosolize it for ease of transmission."/>
						<outline text="''The nano[size] further increases the host range. So now you can go into every cell. Now you can go across the blood brain barrier. That's nano. Now you don't need a receptor. You can breathe it, it can go into every cell of the body. You don't need the gatekeeper. You don't need the receptor. You don't need the lock and key.''"/>
						<outline text="Contaminated Cell Line Shared With Wuhan BiolabAccording to Mikovits, one contaminated cell line is the Vero monkey kidney cell line called Vero E6, which was given by Fort Detrick '-- a U.S. Army Medical Command installation that hosts many of our national biological defense programs and houses the National Cancer Institute laboratory where she used to work '-- to the biosafety 4 laboratory (BSL-4) in Wuhan, China. This cell line is what the Wuhan lab used to grow and study coronaviruses, she says."/>
						<outline text="The Vero cell line is listed in the 2015 paper,8  ''A SARS-like Cluster of Circulating Bat Coronaviruses Shows Potential for Human Emergence,'' co-written by University of North Carolina researchers and Dr. Shi Zhengli, a Chinese virologist at the Wuhan lab who in 2010 published a paper9  discussing the weaponization of the SARS virus."/>
						<outline text="The contaminated Vero monkey kidney cells were also used in the production of polio vaccines, Mikovits notes. The original polio vaccines were passed through mice brains, as we didn't have cell lines in the 1930s when that vaccine was originally developed. According to Mikovitz, the spread of this Vero retrovirus has occurred through laboratory workers and hospital caretakers for decades."/>
						<outline text="''That's why the family studies we did were so important,'' she says, referring to studies in which retroviral transmission was tracked to determine how it spread between family members.10"/>
						<outline text="Alas, whenever patterns were detected, she was always directed to cover them up. Her refusal to hide the information from the public was what led to her firing in 2011. According to Mikovits, we're seeing the same pattern of sweeping evidence under the rug now during the COVID-19 pandemic."/>
						<outline text="''The patterns are the same as far as the science goes, and the patterns are the same as far as the political corruption, the plague of corruption, in covering up data,'' she says."/>
						<outline text="Mikovits Pioneering Research in XMRVIn 2009, Mikovits got embroiled in controversy when she wrote a paper reporting that a retrovirus known as xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus may play a causal role in CFS and other diseases, including autism. I interviewed her about this intriguing and complex story in December 2018 (see linked sentence)."/>
						<outline text="Her career background and past troubles also involved Fauci who, according to Mikovits, is guilty of scientific fraud. She details this in her book, ''Plague of Corruption: Restoring Faith in the Promise of Science.''"/>
						<outline text="According to Mikovits, Fauci does not appear to have changed his stripes, and is still misleading the public and hiding the truth about SARS-CoV-2, just like he did with the HIV virus and retroviral-associated diseases."/>
						<outline text="''I think the way to think about the background of what's going on right now is to go back to my first interactions with Dr. Tony Fauci when I was a 25-year-old lab technician in the National Cancer Institute. At that time, we had isolated '-- from blood and saliva '-- the lymphadenopathy virus."/>
						<outline text="[Lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV)] was the name given to it by Luc Montagnier, the Nobel Laureate, [who] first isolated and discovered that virus and its association with HIV/AIDS.11"/>
						<outline text="In that situation, Fauci delayed the serology testing [to find out] who was exposed [to HIV]. It was politicized such that the only people that were [said to be] susceptible to getting infected with HIV was gay men [and] IV drug users."/>
						<outline text="The country was told not to worry about it. It was only spread through blood and body fluids and shouldn't be a problem for most other people. So, the testing that could have been done wasn't done because of political reasons, and the treatments weren't done because Fauci had patents, and '-- we didn't know this at the time '-- the wrong type of treatment was used. That led to the spread and [death] of millions worldwide '...''"/>
						<outline text="The Discovery of Human GammaretrovirusesUltimately, Mikovits and her colleagues discovered that the HIV virus was spread through a contaminated blood supply. After that, they proceeded to look into other ''clearly retroviral-associated diseases,'' such as CFS,12  certain kinds of autism, cancers, leukemias and lymphomas."/>
						<outline text="Gammaretroviruses13  are viruses that can cause cancer, leukemia and immune deficiencies in various animals. Examples include murine leukemia virus, feline leukemia virus and  mink focus forming virus. As explained in a 2011 paper on gamma retroviruses:14"/>
						<outline text="''Retroviruses are evolutionary optimized gene carriers that have naturally adapted to their hosts to efficiently deliver their nucleic acids into the target cell chromatin, thereby overcoming natural cellular barriers '..."/>
						<outline text="Retroviral vectors are fascinating and efficient delivery tools for the transfer of nucleic acids. As a hallmark, all retroviruses are capable of reverse transcribing their single stranded RNA genome into double stranded DNA, which will be stably integrated into the host cell genome."/>
						<outline text="As highly evolved parasites they act in concert with cellular host factors to deliver their nucleic acid into the nucleus, where they exploit the host cell's machinery for their own replication and long-term expression occurs.''"/>
						<outline text="The key take-home here is that retroviruses are ''integrated into the host cell genome,'' and infection can result in ''long-term expression.'' In other words, once they're in your body, they can remain dormant, only to reactivate when conditions are favorable. In this regard, they're quite different from your average virus that, when you're exposed, invades your cells, replicates and causes symptoms, and is eventually eliminated from your body through your immune response."/>
						<outline text="In 2009, Mikovits and her team discovered and isolated the first human gammaretrovirus family of retroviruses, known then as XMRVs. As mentioned earlier, XMRV stands for ''xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus.'' Xenotrophic refers to viruses that only replicate in cells other than those of the host species. So, XMRVs are viruses that infect human cells yet are not human viruses.15"/>
						<outline text="My Entire Interview With Judy MikovitsTo reiterate some of the key take-home messages Mikovits delivers in this interview:"/>
						<outline text="'  She believes COVID-19 '-- the disease '-- is not caused by SARS-CoV-2 alone, but rather that it's the result of a combination of SARS-CoV-2 (which appears to have been manipulated to include components of HIV that destroys immune function). Previous XMRV (human gammaretroviruses) infection may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 to express the COVID-19 illness."/>
						<outline text="Put another way, COVID-19 may be initiated by SARS-CoV-2 but dependent upon a preexisting infection with and awakening of other viruses such as XMRV, gamma retroviruses, possibly Lyme and other coinfections, including parasites, and this is why anti-parasitic medications like hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin help."/>
						<outline text="'  Blood products and vaccines are contaminated with XMRVs that can damage your immune system and cause CFS, cancer and other chronic diseases. The viruses spread within laboratories as they have adapted to become aerosolized, and contaminate cell lines used in vaccine production and other viral research, including research on coronaviruses."/>
						<outline text="'  Flu vaccines have spread a host of dangerous viruses around the world, which can then interact with SARS COV-2."/>
						<outline text="'  It is possible to develop safer oral vaccines, and interferon alpha could be a valuable treatment alternative against COVID-19. Aside from interferons, other treatment strategies discussed in our interview include hyperbaric oxygen therapy, cannabinoids (CBD), peptide T and antioxidant support."/>
						<outline text="'  SARS-CoV-2 is more dangerous and virulent than typical coronaviruses because it includes sequences of HIV, SARS and another virus, which enable it to infect more than just your respiratory epithelium. It can also infect blood cells and hematopoeitic organs such as the spleen."/>
						<outline text="Last but not least, if this topic intrigues you, be sure to pick up a copy of her new book, ''Plague of Corruption: Restoring Faith in the Promise of Science.'' You can also find more information on her website, plaguethebook.com."/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose ''expert'' advice to President Trump has resulted in the complete shutdown of the greatest economic engine in world history, has known since 2005 that chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of coronaviruses."/>
						<outline text="How did he know this? Because of research done by the National Institutes of Health, of which he is the director. In connection with the SARS outbreak - caused by a coronavirus dubbed SARS- CoV - the NIH researched chloroquine and concluded that it was effective at stopping the SARS coronavirus in its tracks. The COVID-19 bug is likewise a coronavirus, labeled SARS-CoV-2. While not exactly the same virus as SARS-CoV-1, it is genetically related to it, and shares 79% of its genome, as the name SARS-CoV-2 implies. They both use the same host cell receptor, which is what viruses use to gain entry to the cell and infect the victim."/>
						<outline text="The Virology Journal - the official publication of Dr. Fauci's National Institutes of Health - published what is now  a blockbuster article  on August 22, 2005, under the heading - get ready for this - ''Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.'' (Emphasis mine throughout.) Write the researchers, ''We report...that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.''"/>
						<outline text="This means, of course, that Dr. Fauci (pictured at right) has known for 15 years that chloroquine and it's even milder derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) will not only treat a current case of coronavirus (''therapeutic'') but prevent future cases (''prophylactic''). So HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine. In other words, it's a wonder drug for coronavirus. Said Dr. Fauci's NIH in 2005, ''concentrations of 10 Î¼M completely abolished SARS-CoV infection.'' Fauci's researchers add, ''chloroquine can effectively reduce the establishment of infection and spread of SARS-CoV.''"/>
						<outline text="Dr. Didier Raoult, the Anthony Fauci of France, had such spectacular success using HCQ to treat victims of SARS-CoV-2 that he said way back on February 25 that ''it's game over'' for coronavirus."/>
						<outline text="He and a team of researchers reported  that the use of HCQ administered with both azithromycin and zinc cured 79 of 80 patients with only ''rare and minor'' adverse events. ''In conclusion,'' these researchers write, ''we confirm the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine associated with azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 and its potential effectiveness in the early impairment of contagiousness.''"/>
						<outline text="The highly-publicized VA study that purported to show HCQ was ineffective showed nothing of the sort. HCQ wasn't administered until the patients were virtually on their deathbeds when research indicates it should be prescribed as soon as symptoms are apparent. Plus, HCQ was administered without azithromycin and zinc, which form the cocktail that makes it supremely effective. At-risk individuals need to receive the HCQ cocktail at the first sign of symptoms."/>
						<outline text="But Governor Andrew Cuomo banned the use of HCQ in the entire state of New York on March 6, the Democrat governors of Nevada and Michigan soon followed suit, and by March 28 the whole country was under incarceration-in-place fatwas."/>
						<outline text="Nothing happened with regard to the use of HCQ in the U.S. until March 20, when President Trump put his foot down and insisted that the FDA consider authorizing HCQ for off-label use to treat SARS-CoV-2."/>
						<outline text="On March 23, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko  reported  that he had treated around 500 coronavirus patients with HCQ and had seen an astonishing 100% success rate. That's not the ''anecdotal'' evidence Dr. Fauci sneers at, but actual results with real patients in clinical settings."/>
						<outline text="''Since last Thursday, my team has treated approximately 350 patients in Kiryas Joel and another 150 patients in other areas of New York with the above regimen. Of this group and the information provided to me by affiliated medical teams, we have had ZERO deaths, ZERO hospitalizations, and ZERO intubations. In addition, I have not heard of any negative side effects other than approximately 10% of patients with temporary nausea and diarrhea.''"/>
						<outline text="Said Dr. Zelenko :"/>
						<outline text="&quot;If you scale this nationally, the economy will rebound much quicker. The country will open again. And let me tell you a very important point. This treatment costs about $20. That's very important because you can scale that nationally. If every treatment costs $20,000, that's not so good."/>
						<outline text="All I'm doing is repurposing old, available drugs which we know their safety profiles, and using them in a unique combination in an outpatient setting.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="The questions are disturbing to a spectacular degree. If Dr. Fauci has known since 2005 of the effectiveness of HCQ, why hasn't it been administered immediately after people show symptoms, as Dr. Zelenko has done? Maybe then nobody would have died and nobody would have been incarcerated in place except the sick, which is who a quarantine is for in the first place. To paraphrase Jesus, it's not the symptom-free who need HCQ but the sick. And they need it at the first sign of symptoms."/>
						<outline text="While the regressive health care establishment wants the HCQ cocktail to only be administered late in the course of the infection, from a medical standpoint, this is stupid. Said one doctor, ''As a physician, this baffles me. I can't think of a single infectious condition '-- bacterial, fungal, or viral '-- where the best medical treatment is to delay the use of an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, or anti-viral until the infection is far advanced.''"/>
						<outline text="So why has Dr. Fauci minimized and dismissed HCQ at every turn instead of pushing this thing from jump street? He didn't even launch clinical trials of HCQ until April 9, by which time 33,000 people had died."/>
						<outline text="This may be why: ''Chloroquine, a relatively safe, effective and cheap drug used for treating many human diseases...is effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV.'' That's the problem. It is safe, inexpensive, and it works - in other words, there's nothing sexy or avant-garde about HCQ. It's been around since 1934."/>
						<outline text="Given human nature, it's possible, even likely, that those who are chasing the unicorn of a coronavirus vaccine are doing so for reasons other than human health. I can't see into anybody's heart, and can't presume to know their motives, but on the other hand, human nature recognizes that there's no glory in pushing HCQ, and nobody is going to get anything named for him in the history books. The polio vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk in 1954, and it is still known as the ''Salk vaccine.'' There will be no ''Fauci vaccine'' if HCQ is the answer to the problem."/>
						<outline text="So while Dr. Fauci is tut-tutting and pooh-poohing HCQ, Dr. Raoult and Dr. Zelensky are out there saving lives at $20 a pop. Maybe we should spend more time listening to them than the wizards-of-smart bureaucrats the Talking Snake Media fawns over."/>
						<outline text="Dr. Fauci is regarded by the Talking Snake Media as the Oracle at Delphi. The entire nation hangs on his every word. But if nobody is dying and nobody is locked down, his 15 minutes of fame fades to zero. Very few people are not going to be influenced by that prospect, especially when it's easy to keep the attention of the public by continuing to feed the panic."/>
						<outline text="It should not be overlooked that there is no money in HCQ for Big Pharma since HCQ is a generic that can be manufactured so cheaply there is little profit margin in it. On the other hand, the payday for a vaccine will literally be off-the-charts. Who knows what kind of behind-the-scenes pressure is being put on Fauci and others in the health care establishment?"/>
						<outline text="There is a monstrous reputational risk for those who will be found to have dismissively waved off a treatment that could have been used from the very beginning, even back on February 15 when Dr. Fauci said that the risk from Coronavirus was ''minuscule.'' How many lives could have been saved if the heads of our multi-billion dollar health care bureaucracy had been advocating for HCQ treatment from day one? We'll never know. Instead, their advice has been dangerous and deadly in every sense of that word."/>
						<outline text="Someday - maybe even today - we will be able to identify the individuals who had the knowledge and expertise to make a global difference, but turned up their noses at the solution when it could have made all the difference in the world."/>

						<outline text="Highlights'We examined virus interference in a Department of Defense dependent population."/>
						<outline text="'Vaccinated personnel did not have significant odds of respiratory illnesses."/>
						<outline text="'Vaccinated personnel were protected against influenza."/>
						<outline text="'Odds of virus interference by vaccination varied for individual respiratory viruses."/>
						<outline text="AbstractPurposeReceiving influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses, a phenomenon known as virus interference. Test-negative study designs are often utilized to calculate influenza vaccine effectiveness. The virus interference phenomenon goes against the basic assumption of the test-negative vaccine effectiveness study that vaccination does not change the risk of infection with other respiratory illness, thus potentially biasing vaccine effectiveness results in the positive direction. This study aimed to investigate virus interference by comparing respiratory virus status among Department of Defense personnel based on their influenza vaccination status. Furthermore, individual respiratory viruses and their association with influenza vaccination were examined."/>
						<outline text="ResultsWe compared vaccination status of 2880 people with non-influenza respiratory viruses to 3240 people with pan-negative results. Comparing vaccinated to non-vaccinated patients, the adjusted odds ratio for non-flu viruses was 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86, 1.09; p'¯='¯0.60). Additionally, the vaccination status of 3349 cases of influenza were compared to three different control groups: all controls (N'¯='¯6120), non-influenza positive controls (N'¯='¯2880), and pan-negative controls (N'¯='¯3240). The adjusted ORs for the comparisons among the three control groups did not vary much (range: 0.46''0.51)."/>
						<outline text="ConclusionsReceipt of influenza vaccination was not associated with virus interference among our population. Examining virus interference by specific respiratory viruses showed mixed results. Vaccine derived virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus and human metapneumovirus; however, significant protection with vaccination was associated not only with most influenza viruses, but also parainfluenza, RSV, and non-influenza virus coinfections."/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="Three Russian doctors working to treat coronavirus patients have mysteriously fallen out of windows in recent weeks, underscoring the country's struggling health care system '-- and leading to suspicions of foul play."/>
						<outline text="On April 24, Natalya Lebedeva, the chief of emergency medical services at a training base for Russian astronauts, fell out of a window at the hospital where she was being treated for a Covid-19 infection and died."/>
						<outline text="Yelena Nepomnyashchaya, the top doctor at a hospital in Siberia, fell out of a window during a conference call at her hospital and died on May 1 after a week in intensive care."/>
						<outline text="The next day, ambulance doctor Alexander Shulepov fell from a second-floor window at the hospital where he worked and had been receiving treatment for Covid-19. He remains in serious condition with a fractured skull."/>
						<outline text="Russian authorities are investigating all three incidents, and there is no official indication yet of what happened to the physicians. The circumstances around their falls, though, are more than a little suspicious."/>
						<outline text="For example, Nepomnyashchaya was on a conference call with a top Russian health official about plans for turning one of the buildings at her medical facility into a coronavirus treatment ward. She disagreed with the idea, and fell out of the window during the call, according to local media."/>
						<outline text="And Shulepov had, along with a colleague, posted a video online on April 22 '-- the day he was admitted for coronavirus care '-- complaining that he had been forced to work despite contracting the disease. Five days later, Shulepov retracted his comments, saying he had spoken in ''an emotional state.'' Less than a week later, he fell out of a window."/>
						<outline text="The circumstances around Lebedeva's fall at the Russian astronaut training center are less clear, with the hospital where she died releasing a statement saying she ''died tragically'' in an ''accident,'' with no additional details provided."/>
						<outline text="A medical staff worker in protective gear gets off an ambulance at the Novomoskovsky multipurpose medical center for patients with suspected coronavirus infections on May 5, 2020.        Sergei Karpukhin\TASS via Getty Images    So what's going on here? Is it possible this is all an unfortunate coincidence? Are Russian medical facilities, creaking under the strain of the coronavirus, struggling to keep people safe? Or is there something more nefarious going on? Is the Russian government surreptitiously killing people who speak out about the failures of the country's coronavirus response?"/>
						<outline text="Nobody yet knows for sure, but it's worth looking into what we do know about each incident and the theories surrounding them."/>
						<outline text="What we know about the lives and falls of the three doctorsThe amount of available details on each case varies widely. But what's available at least allows for some idea of what happened."/>
						<outline text="Not much has yet come out on Lebedeva, the 48-year-old who led the emergency medical team in the astronaut training base in Star City, just on the outskirts of Moscow. Some reports indicate she may have helped treat Moscow's coronavirus ''patient zero.''"/>
						<outline text="After she contracted the coronavirus, she was hospitalized at the Federal Scientific Clinical Center in Moscow on April 20. Four days later, she fell out of a sixth-floor window and died instantly."/>
						<outline text="The hospital labeled her plunge an accident in a statement, also offering some kind words about her time leading the medical team: ''She was a true professional in her field, saving human lives every day!'' But other than that, much remains a mystery."/>
						<outline text="More is known about what happened in the case of Nepomnyashchaya, the 47-year-old who ran the Krasnoyarsk Regional Hospital for War Veterans."/>
						<outline text="During an April conference call with Boris Nemik, the regional minister of health, she pushed back on demands for her to make 80 beds in a part of her hospital available to treat coronavirus patients. Reportedly, her biggest concern was that her staff didn't have enough personal protective equipment to treat Covid-19 patients."/>
						<outline text="The local Ministry of Health denied that her 50-foot fall from her office window had anything to do with the conference call. And Aleksey Podkorytov, the deputy head of the Krasnoyarsk region's government, offered some alternative explanations for her plunge."/>
						<outline text="Members of the International Space Station expedition 59/60, NASA astronauts Christina Hammock Koch and Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin, walk during their final exam at the Gagarin Cosmonauts' Training Center in Star City outside Moscow on February 20, 2019.        STR/AFP via Getty Images    ''So many things could have happened,'' he told reporters in April. ''It could have been because it was spring, the overall stress, something in her family. It's difficult to say what could have happened. ... There was nothing extraordinary happening at the time, just a routine conference call with doctors' reports.''"/>
						<outline text="As for Shulepov, who fell out of the Novousmanskaya hospital's second-floor window last Saturday, more is known because of what he posted online. On April 22, the 37-year-old physician and his colleague Alexander Kosyakin made a video in which they claimed they still had to work at their hospital despite falling ill with the coronavirus."/>
						<outline text="''Ambulance doctor Alexander Shulepov is next to me, he is just confirmed Covid-19,'' Kosyakin said in the video. ''The chief doctor is forcing us to work. What do we do in this situation?''"/>
						<outline text="''We are not leaving the shift,'' Kosyakin continued. ''Myself and Alexander ha[ve] been working together for a month. This is the situation. Everyone says it's fake [but] these are real facts for you.'' They also noted that the southwestern city of Voronezh '-- where they both work '-- was low on personal protective equipment."/>
						<outline text="But five days later, Shulepov had changed his message in a new video posted to Instagram. ''I have a runny nose, otherwise all is well,'' he said, adding that ''we were high on emotions'' when he and Kosyakin made the first video."/>
						<outline text="Some think it's possible authorities put pressure on Shulepov. His colleague, Kosyakin, had previously complained about the lack of medical equipment and hospital leadership, leading police to question him for allegedly posting fake news."/>
						<outline text="Kosyakin, who spoke to CNN on Tuesday, seems suspicious about what happened to Shulepov. When he last checked in with his colleague on April 30, ''He felt fine, he was getting ready to get discharged from the hospital,'' Kosyakin said. ''And all of a sudden this happened, it's not clear why and what for, so many questions that I don't even have the answer to.''"/>
						<outline text="Three incidents, three mysteries. It remains unclear what happened in each case, but experts have some thoughts."/>
						<outline text="Three leading theories for what's going onAsk a group of Russia experts what's going on with these cases and you'll likely get a different answer from each one. But three explanations seem to be the most prevalent: suicides, assassinations, and the perils of an ailing health care system."/>
						<outline text="SuicideDr. Vasiliy Vlassov, an epidemiologist at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, said these could be cases of death by suicide. ''I believe that this cluster is a reflection of really high incidence of suicides nowadays, because chief physicians are working under high pressure,'' he told me. Because guns are hard to obtain in the country, ''jumping is a reasonable option.''"/>
						<outline text="Judy Twigg, an expert on Russia's health care system at Virginia Commonwealth University, agreed. She told me all three cases have ''intense stress'' in common, either over the lack of personal protective equipment in the hospitals where the individuals worked or because the people got sick themselves."/>
						<outline text="Further, the three cases happened outside Moscow, which has most of the funding and medical equipment needed to properly treat coronavirus patients. The facilities where the three doctors worked, like many others in the country and around the world, ''are breaking more under the strain,'' Twigg said."/>
						<outline text="Workers at the construction site of a field hospital in Pavilion No. 75 at the VDNKh exhibition center during the pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease on May 4, 2020.        Mikhail Tereshchenko\TASS via Getty Images    Death by suicide is a plausible theory, as suicide is a persistent national problem. According to the World Health Organization, Russia has the third-highest suicide rate in the world. In 2016, the latest year for which there's complete data, about 122 people a day died by suicide in Russia, adding up to around 45,000 deaths."/>
						<outline text="That explanation is bolstered by reporting from the Russian daily Moskovsky Komsomolets, which quoted some of Lebedeva's colleagues claiming she had been accused of spreading the disease to her subordinates, so therefore it was possible she died by suicide."/>
						<outline text="Assassination''I would not be surprised if the security services were involved, sending a message to keep quiet on the crisis,'' said Alina Polyakova, president of the Center for European Policy Analysis."/>
						<outline text="For many, that might sound conspiratorial. Would the Russian government really kill medical professionals just because they questioned or criticized the country's handling of the coronavirus crisis?"/>
						<outline text="But this theory is not as far-fetched as it may seem. ''It's not a conspiracy theory,'' Toomas Hendrik Ilves, Estonia's president from 2006 to 2016, tweeted on Monday. He added that ''defenestrations are a long term practice,'' using the technical term for the act of throwing someone out of a window."/>
						<outline text="There are previous cases of Russian officials allegedly trying to kill adversaries by pushing them out of windows. In 2017, Russian lawyer Nikolai Gorokhov was due to testify in a Moscow court against the government. But the day before he could do so, he fell from his fourth-floor apartment. The first news outlet to arrive at the scene? LifeNews, an outlet closely associated with Russia's security services."/>
						<outline text="In a 2017 interview with NBC News, Gorokhov '-- who'd fractured his skull but ultimately survived the fall '-- said what happened to him was likely foul play. ''This was no accident,'' he said. ''Someone planned this, but unfortunately I do not remember the details.'' He refused to elaborate further, saying he feared for his life and for the safety of his family."/>
						<outline text="There's also a pattern of Kremlin adversaries being assassinated through other, even more elaborate means. For example, in 2009 Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky was poisoned in prison, likely because he had uncovered a massive government-linked fraud scheme that threatened top officials. Six years later, Boris Nemtsov, a top rival to President Vladimir Putin, was killed in the heart of Moscow. And in 2018, two Russians tried to kill with a nerve agent a former Kremlin spy living in the UK."/>
						<outline text="Murder, then, may not be completely out of the question."/>
						<outline text="A stressed health care systemAt a time when Russia's medical facilities are full and safety isn't a top concern, it's possible that three health care providers over the span of a few weeks made tragic missteps simply because they were tired and overworked."/>
						<outline text="''This is really about the destruction of our healthcare system,'' Anastasia Vasilyeva, a staunch Kremlin critic and head of the Alliance of Doctors Union, told CNN on Tuesday. ''A lot of clinics and hospitals have been closed. ... And, of course, this means it is very difficult to treat in such conditions a lot of patients with coronavirus.''"/>
						<outline text="This is conceivable. Though Russia's health care system was relatively well prepared for a large public health crisis, at least compared to many other countries, it has a problem with old and faulty equipment. And many facilities outside the country's two major urban areas '-- Moscow and St. Petersburg '-- lack the resources to provide proper care."/>
						<outline text="But, as even President Vladimir Putin admits, the coronavirus crisis in the country is getting worse and worse."/>
						<outline text="''Ahead of us is a new stage, perhaps the most intense stage of the fight against the epidemic,'' Putin said in a national address last week, in which he also announced an extension of his nation's lockdown until May 11. ''The risks of getting infected are at the highest level, and the threat, the mortal danger of the virus persists.''"/>
						<outline text="As Russia becomes one of Europe's worst-hit countries, it's possible that weary, ill physicians may have taken some missteps in such trying times."/>
						<outline text="The hope is that Russian authorities not only fully investigate what's happened but provide detailed, truthful answers. But given Russia's track record, that outcome could be the least likely of all."/>

						<outline text="Tue, 05 May 2020 00:55"/>
						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="NaturalHealth365) As COVID-19 continues its march across the globe '' and officials warn of a ''tsunami'' of newly-diagnosed cases and continuing fatalities in the U.S. '' a team of Canadian researchers is basing their hopes on quercetin, a flavonoid from plants.At the center of this flurry of optimism is research helmed by Dr. Michael Chr(C)tien, a renowned scientist at the Clinical Research Institute of Montreal. Along with his co-researcher, Congolese scientist Majambu Mbikay, Dr. Chr(C)tien is currently awaiting approval to send the drug (derived from plants) to China for clinical trials that will test it against the novel coronavirus."/>
						<outline text="While this would be the first clinical study to test quercetin against COVID-19, natural health experts have long credited this natural plant pigment with the ability to deal with a variety of viruses. In fact, Dr. Chr(C)tien describes quercetin as a ''broad spectrum antiviral'' that has been shown in studies to be effective against such formidable diseases as SARS, the Ebola virus, and the Zika virus."/>
						<outline text="Incoming data from quercetin trial will be monitored minute-by-minute from MontrealIn a series of interviews and articles, Dr. Chr(C)tien has released details of the imminent study.  Once the team is granted approval to send the quercetin to China, samples will be delivered to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan."/>
						<outline text="Canadian and Chinese scientists will then collaborate on the trials, which will involve about 1,000 test patients.  Drs. Chretien and Mbikay will join colleagues from the non-profit International Consortium of Antivirals (which Chr(C)tien helped to found in 2004 as a response to the SARS epidemic) in maintaining a round-the-clock communications center."/>
						<outline text="From there, they will be able monitor patients' progress in Wuhan, including viewing patients' charts and X-rays.  According to Dr. Chr(C)tien, it may be possible to have results on quercetin's ability to treat COVID within 60 days of the beginning of the trial."/>
						<outline text="''Bingo! It works!'' Groundbreaking researcher's earlier studies on SARS and Ebola laid the groundwork for current COVID researchSince the 2003 SARS outbreak '' which infected over 8,000 patients in 26 countries '' Dr. Chr(C)tien has been studying potential treatments (including quercetin) for the virus, in the event that it resurfaces.  And, while clinical trials haven't yet been performed, quercetin has shown great promise in combating SARS (severe acute respiratory distress) in animal models."/>
						<outline text="This is very significant, because COVID-19 is structurally similar to SARS.  In fact, the new coronavirus is also known as SARS-CoV-2.  And, earlier research has given cause for hope."/>
						<outline text="In a 2014 study published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Drs. Chr(C)tien and Mbikay concluded that a glucosylated form of quercetin (Quercetin 3-B-O-D glucoside) targeted various steps of viral entry and protected mice against the Ebola virus."/>
						<outline text="The team also learned that pre-treatment with quercetin, rather than post-treatment, offered the best protection.  In a recent interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation News Network, Dr. Chr(C)tien offered a more informal reaction to the Ebola study's encouraging results."/>
						<outline text="''Bingo! It worked!'' he recalled."/>
						<outline text="Dr. Chr(C)tien, who is generally recognized as one of the most renowned scientists and medical researchers in the world, has a strong emotional and professional connection with China."/>
						<outline text="He received training under noted Chinese researcher Dr. C.H. Li, and served as an honorary professor at both the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College."/>
						<outline text="This therapy is non-toxic, safe and pre-approved for use by humansThe good news: the FDA has already approved quercetin as safe for human consumption '' meaning that no animal testing is necessary.  This also means that if the treatment works, it should be available quickly."/>
						<outline text="The quercetin will be in the form of easily-administered oral supplements.  And, Dr. Chr(C)tien asserts that quercetin is so safe that even the high doses used in the study will not cause side effects."/>
						<outline text="Co-researcher Dr. Mbikay notes that quercetin would cost a mere $2 a day '' a negligible amount that stands in stark contrast to the $1,000-per- injection cost of existing COVID-19 treatments.  ''It (quercetin) doesn't even compare in price,'' Dr. Mbikay pointed out."/>
						<outline text="He added that he is particularly hopeful that quercetin could eventually be used to ease outbreaks in African countries '' which he says lack the infrastructure for treating COVID-19."/>
						<outline text="A natural way to inhibit viral replication and defeat influenzaQuercetin, a plant pigment found in fruits and vegetables, is currently used to treat inflammatory diseases, reduce allergy symptoms and lower cholesterol."/>
						<outline text="But what is particularly relevant '' especially now '' is quercetin's ability to boost the immune system and interfere with viral replication.  In a review published in Viruses, the authors concluded that quercetin inhibited viral infections in the early stages '' particularly during viral attachment and viral-cell fusion."/>
						<outline text="Quercetin has already shown the ability to inhibit both the A and B types of influenza, along with the H1N1 and the H3N2 viruses. Some forward-thinking physicians in the US already credit quercetin with being both safer and more effective than Tamiflu, the ''gold standard'' of medical therapies for influenza."/>
						<outline text="And, researchers are reporting that viruses seem to be incapable of developing immunity to quercetin '' another huge plus."/>
						<outline text="To boost your own intake of dietary quercetin, opt for healthy amounts of organic unpeeled apples, dark cherries, cocoa, dark leafy greens, green tea and onions."/>
						<outline text="Quercetin is also available as a supplement, with natural healers advising typical dosages of 500 mg twice a day. As always, consult your own integrative healthcare provider before adding quercetin to your immune-boosting routine."/>
						<outline text="Discover a safe way to improve quercetin bioavailability and ''supercharge'' its therapeutic potentialIt's simple: be sure to consume vitamin C!  Natural health experts already know that vitamin C has antioxidant, immune system-boosting and antiviral effects."/>
						<outline text="As reported previously in NaturalHealth365, high-dose IV vitamin C is already being used throughout China to help combat the COVID-19 outbreak '' with three different new studies winning approval.  On March 3, the government of Shanghai, China, announced its official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high amounts of IV vitamin C."/>

						<outline text="The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) are not taking the coronavirus epidemic seriously, to judge from their funding priorities. On April 20, those two agencies announced the availability of grants to increase the ''diversity'' of biomedical research labs. Academic virologists working on respiratory failure, say, could receive hundreds of thousands more taxpayer dollars if they could find a ''diverse'' student to add to the project. No scientific justification for the new diversity hire is needed; indeed, high school students are eligible, despite the virtual certainty that they will contribute nothing of value. To the contrary, such new hires will be a drag on any medical advance, since the scientists must pledge to mentor the students, taking time and attention away from their scientific research. Those mentees will be chosen not because of their science skills'--they need present none'--but because of their group's underrepresentation in STEM."/>
						<outline text="The premier federal funders of biomedical research, in other words, apparently believe that a pandemic is the perfect moment to focus further on identity politics. If diversity trumps scientific merit in biomedical research, including in immunology and virology, then those research efforts cannot be particularly important, despite the experts' economy-crushing shutdown mandates."/>
						<outline text="The CDC, NIH, and the National Science Foundation (NSF) have been color- and sex-coding their research grants for years, on the grounds that ''scientific innovation,'' in the words of the NIH, requires scientists from ''diverse backgrounds and life experiences.'' But the newly announced ''Research Supplements to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research'' exponentially boost those agencies' social-justice agenda. Besides the usual preferences for women, blacks, and Hispanics, the following categories now also qualify for diversity funding: being or having been homeless; being or having been in foster care; having been eligible for free school lunches; having no parents with a bachelor's degree; and having received WIC payments (a food program for low-income mothers) as a child or mother. The claim that being black or female increases one's chances of achieving a scientific breakthrough was always fanciful, but the idea that having been homeless or having had a mother on welfare is in any way relevant to genome sequencing or cancer treatment is preposterous. The NIH and CDC assert that the scientific enterprise requires a wide range of ''viewpoints.'' Different minds may in fact approach knotty problems differently. But having been in foster care is simply too remote from the challenge of developing a vaccine to block SARS-CoV-2 to be a valid substitute for scientific expertise."/>
						<outline text="The CDC may have struggled with coronavirus testing early on, but it and the NIH are fully up to speed when it comes to academic grievance studies. The latest ''Research Supplements to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research'' place great stock in ''intersectionality.'' STEM departments hoping for a research supplement will increase their chances by hiring females who are also an underrepresented minority, disabled, or from a ''disadvantaged background.'' Singly, these categories have nothing to do with scientific merit; they gain no additional relevance from having been aggregated."/>
						<outline text="The NSF, another federal funder of basic biomedical research, has also increased its identity-based spending during the pandemic. It recently announced that it would be pouring another $29 million of taxpayer dollars into its ADVANCE program. ADVANCE's premise is that STEM departments are rife with implicit bias against competitively qualified females and underrepresented minorities. Achieving gender and racial ''equity'' in STEM requires ''organizational change,'' which grantees can pursue via four supposedly distinct ''tracks:'' ''Institutional Transformation,'' ''Adaptation,'' ''Partnership,'' and ''Catalyst.'' (In fact, these largely indistinguishable ''tracks'' simply represent bureaucratic rhetorical churn.) Successful applications, whether in molecular bioscience or mechanical engineering, will apply ''intersectional approaches'' to institutional change, recognizing that ''gender, race, and ethnicity do not exist in isolation from each other and from other categories of social identity.''"/>
						<outline text="Science, of course, is not the only arena where identity politics has recently surged. The New York City health department requires that its contact tracers understand ''institutional and structural racism'' and have a ''demonstrated commitment'' to victims of such racism, i.e., ''people of color, LGBTQ+ people, immigrants, [and] justice involved persons [translation: criminals].'' How such ''knowledge'' is supposed to affect the collection of health and contact data is unclear. The higher coronavirus death rate for blacks in some cities has been attributed to biased doctors and nurses, as well as to systemic societal injustice. Acknowledging behaviorally driven health disparities is taboo. Keeping essential workers on the job is said to be racist; reopening businesses to nonessential workers is also racist."/>
						<outline text="But the most audacious play for top-dog victim status comes from feminists. Politico magazine denounces ''Covid's War on Women.'' It may seem to be ''cause for celebration'' that more men than women are dying, Politico acknowledges. If there were any doubt about the cultural elite's contempt for masculinity, these glad tidings of joy should dispel it. (We will not pause to consider the effect of substituting ''blacks'' for ''men'' and ''whites'' for ''women.'') Nevertheless, Politico warns, despite the seeming good news, the pandemic has been ''worse for girls and women'' than for men, since those non-dead women are still around to bear more ''workplace risk.''"/>
						<outline text="MSNBC anchor Andrea Mitchell took up the same theme on April 20. ''Women are being hit particularly hard by the coronavirus,'' Mitchell lamented. As the majority of service workers, women are now out of work and having to carry the burden of housework, Mitchell said. On the other hand, women workers are being exposed to the virus ''in a way that's disproportionate,'' according to Cecille Richards, founder of the women's political-action committee Supermajority and former head of Planned Parenthood. In other words, keeping women on the job reflects sexism; laying them off also reflects sexism."/>
						<outline text="It was not so long ago that New York governor Andrew Cuomo was announcing that saving just one life justifies any expenditure and any economic destruction that government might impose. Now we hear that the male body count is less important than the fact that female service workers are being exposed to the virus, even if that exposure carries a much lower risk of death. In fact, the sex disparities in coronavirus deaths often dwarf those racial disparities that we have been told are so concerning. In New York City, the coronavirus death rate for males was 70 percent higher than for females as of April 30: 190.5 per 100,000 of population for males, versus 112 per 100,000 of population for females. Yet New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams asserted in early April that the city's official responses to the virus had ''clearly'' discriminated against blacks, in light of the fact that blacks make up 23 percent of the city's population, but were 27.5 percent of virus fatalities where the race of the deceased was recorded."/>
						<outline text="We are accustomed to such demagoguery from politicians. But one might expect a little more rationality from our scientific leaders. Evidence-based thinking is not how you get ahead in academia or government, however. NIH director Francis Collins announced last June that he would boycott any academic conference or panel in the biomedical field where white males predominated. These male-dominated abominations are known as ''manels.'' A manel is evidence of the bias that prevents ''women and other groups underrepresented in science from achieving their rightful place in scientific leadership,'' Collins said. The NIH director apparently is as innumerate as the most analytically challenged academic vice chancellor for equity, diversity, and inclusion. Given the disparities in math and science skills, a lack of race proportionality (and, to a lesser extent, gender proportionality) in STEM is inevitable, absent radically lowered standards."/>
						<outline text="In 2017, 53 percent of all black eighth-graders failed to demonstrate basic competence in math, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. By contrast, 20 percent of white eighth-graders and 12 percent of Asian eighth-graders were nonproficient in math skills. Only 2 percent of black eighth-graders had advanced math skills, compared with 13 percent of white eighth-graders and 32 percent of Asian eighth-graders. These disparities do not close in high school or college. In light of this skills gap, Collins's explanation for the lack of proportional representation among biomedical scientists as a function of racism is irresponsible. A research lab racing to develop vaccines is not the place to try belatedly to close the academic achievement gap, even were such a goal within reach."/>
						<outline text="The skills divergence is not as great between males and females, but it is nevertheless significant, especially at the highest levels of math capacity, from which top-level researchers are drawn. Males outnumber females by a ratio of two to one on perfect to near-perfect scores on the math SAT (the College Board stopped reporting such fine-grained data several years ago). For math scores above 700, there were 157 boys in 2019 for every 100 girls. Females with high-end math skills tend to have strong verbal skills as well, unlike the average male math whiz. That double strength gives females a greater range of career choices. Many opt for more people-oriented work over a more solitary, ideas-based career in the hard sciences."/>
						<outline text="Hope in the coronavirus fight is now being placed in remdesivir, an anti-viral drug that appears to hasten the recovery of severely ill Covid-19 patients. Mark Denison of Vanderbilt University conducted the early research on other coronaviruses that led to remdesivir's development. He teamed up with pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences after learning about its drug portfolio at an academic conference; Denison's collaboration with Gilead would help bring remdesivir to market. Fortunately, that academic conference occurred before Francis Collins's diktat against manels. If the conference had shown the usual STEM sex-and-race skew, Collins would have recommended that it be boycotted and defunded. Remdesivir may have escaped a politicized end, but who knows what future discoveries will be stunted by the demand for sex-and-race proportionality in STEM?"/>
						<outline text="The coming economic depression may deliver a body blow to the fount of race and gender victimology: America's bloated and politicized colleges. But identity politics has already worked its way into every American institution. The Trump administration has made no effort to eliminate the diversity obsession in federal science agencies. Now would be the time to do so. President Trump should order that scientific funding be granted on a purely meritocratic basis. Sex and race are irrelevant to scientific accomplishment. Not a single cent of taxpayer money should go toward promoting identity politics in STEM'--or anywhere, for that matter."/>

						<outline text="WASHINGTON (AP) '-- U.S. officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak '-- and how contagious the disease is '-- to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show."/>
						<outline text="Chinese leaders ''intentionally concealed the severity'' of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press. The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that China was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable."/>
						<outline text="The sharper rhetoric against China coincides with administration critics saying the government's response to the virus was inadequate and slow. President Donald Trump's political opponents have accused the president and his administration of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home."/>
						<outline text="The analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by ''denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data,'' the analysis states."/>
						<outline text="The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus ''was a contagion'' for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad '-- and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply."/>
						<outline text="Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China's changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report."/>
						<outline text="Trump has speculated that China could have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible ''mistake.'' His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab."/>
						<outline text="Speaking Sunday on ABC's ''This Week,'' Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he added, ''Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories.''"/>

						<outline text="The Texas Republican announced a bill on Tuesday that would bar the Pentagon from working with productions unless they commit not to alter their content to accommodate Chinese censors."/>
						<outline text="Cruz was among those who vociferously objected last year when a trailer for ''Top Gun: Maverick'' showed that the Taiwanese and Japanese flags had been removed from Tom Cruise's flight jacket. Many critics noted that the companies behind the film '-- including Paramount, Skydance and China's Tencent Pictures '-- were preemptively seeking to appease Chinese censors."/>
						<outline text="The film '-- originally set for release in June, but pushed to December due to the pandemic '-- got extensive cooperation from the U.S. Navy."/>
						<outline text="Cruz's bill would also forbid the Defense Department from working with U.S.-China co-productions, where the Chinese partner is subject to Chinese censorship standards."/>
						<outline text="In a statement, the senator warned that China is using its economic power to buy up media companies and to coerce U.S. companies to censor themselves."/>
						<outline text="''The Chinese Communist Party spends billions and billions of dollars to mislead Americans about China and shape what our citizens see, hear and think,'' he said. ''All of these activities are part of China's whole-of-state approach to amass more influence around the world through information warfare '-- and we need to put a stop to it.''"/>
						<outline text="The Motion Picture Association declined to comment."/>
						<outline text="Last July, Cruz told the Washington Free Beacon that the ''Top Gun: Maverick'' episode was symptomatic of a much deeper problem."/>
						<outline text="''Top Gun is an American classic, and it's incredibly disappointing to see Hollywood elites appease the Chinese Communist Party,'' he said at the time. ''The Party uses China's economy to silence dissent against its brutal repression and to erode the sovereignty of American allies like Taiwan. Hollywood is afraid to stand up for free speech and is enabling the Party's campaign against Taiwan.''"/>
						<outline text="The military branches each have entertainment liaisons that review scripts for accuracy and help provide access to equipment, personnel, and military installations."/>

						<outline text="Battleground and non-battleground states felt the same way about China, with around 72.5% saying they agreed the trade relationship had to change."/>
						<outline text="Moreover, some 60% of African-Americans said post-pandemic relations needed to change and 65% of Hispanics agreed, as well. College educated and non-college educated were also on board, with an average of 72.5% agreeing."/>
						<outline text="When asked if the U.S. should outright ''withdraw manufacturing from China'', the number was still high, but by a smaller margin with 59% for a withdrawal."/>
						<outline text="Most U.S. multinationals do not have greenfield projects in China and have to contract out for manufacturing. Apple AAPL, for example, does not own a factory in China, but Taiwanese owned Foxconn makes and assembles most of Apple's goods for both mainland consumers and for the export market. Foxconn does the same for other U.S. tech firms."/>
						<outline text="Within the 59% that wanted U.S. manufacturing to leave China, only the Democrats were slightly less likely to agree with that. Some 43% of Democratic Party supporters said they were for a removal of manufacturing from there compared to 70% Republicans and 62% Independents. This lower number suggests what many Democratic Party critics have said over the last few years '-- that the party has moved away from being a blue collar party and has embraced the A-list and Davos Man instead."/>
						<outline text="MORE FROM FORBES Coronavirus Could Be The End Of China As A Global Manufacturing Hub By Kenneth Rapoza    Of interest in that particular survey question posed by McLaughlin is that 59% of both college and non-college educated people agreed with the U.S. withdrawing manufacturing from China."/>

SafeEntry will advance that debate as its introduction surely suggests that contact-tracing apps have their limitations."/>

						<outline text="In Midtown Manhattan, thermal cameras will measure body temperatures as employees file into a 32-story office tower at Rockefeller Center. The building's owner, RXR Realty, said it is also developing a mobile app for tenants to monitor'--and score'--how closely their workers are complying with social distancing."/>
						<outline text="PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP said it is preparing to launch this month a phone app for employers that traces contacts by analyzing workers' interactions in the office. More than 50 clients have expressed interest, including some of the nation's biggest banks, manufacturers and energy companies."/>
						<outline text="Advertising giant            Interpublic Group of  Cos       . is exploring dividing its 22,000 U.S. employees into three separate groups, according to perceived health risks, which could include age. Workers could be asked to disclose medical and other personal information about themselves and, in some cases, family members."/>
						<outline text="Interpublic hasn't signed off on the system yet, but it's definitely ''on the front burner,'' said Eric Ossmann,  chief medical officer at the medical-advisory firm Vigilint Protective Health Services, which is advising Interpublic. Interpublic said it has only begun preliminary discussions about the system."/>
						<outline text="''It is a reasonable approach, if you can get through the operational and some of the privacy and regulatory issues,'' Dr. Ossmann said."/>
						<outline text="Many office workers have become used to widespread security cameras and keycards that register entries and exits. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, buildings installed enhanced security measures, including logging in visitors and X-raying briefcases."/>
						<outline text="The arrival of Covid-19 is taking surveillance to a higher level, with some employers planning to track movements and gather personal information like never before in Western democracies. It marks a new chapter in the debate over privacy, and the trade-offs people are willing to make for safety."/>
						<outline text="Some companies now see the measures as perhaps the only way to reopen offices without risking a new rise in infections, at least until a vaccine becomes available."/>
						<outline text="Tracking employeesBuilding owners said the systems'--similar to measures used in China that helped slow the spread of the virus'--promote health and safety, so that employers can better monitor and enforce separation between workers, and quickly determine which employees could have come in contact with an infected colleague."/>
						<outline text="The pandemic's ''consequences are far-reaching, and it is going to change the way all these places work,'' said Amol Sarva,  chief executive of flexible-office company Knotel, which is adding features to its app that would allow its customers to track the movements of employees. ''When you design a workplace, it's no longer going to be like 'Hey, is it cool and fun for my people?' A major criterion is going to be: 'Is this place safe and resilient?' ''"/>
						<outline text="Massachusetts-based health-care software company Athenahealth Inc. is considering checking the temperatures of employees but doesn't want to track their movements. ''We trust our employees,'' said Fran Lawler,  Athenahealth's chief human resources officer. ''I think our employees would feel like that is a bit invasive.''"/>
						<outline text="Jason M. Schultz,  professor of clinical law at New York University, who studies workplace monitoring, predicted the tools might remain after the pandemic. ''Employers don't really have any incentives to remove surveillance once they install it,'' he said."/>
						<outline text="When companies began sending their employees home in March, they focused on keeping productivity high despite the remote setups. In anticipation of workers returning to offices, some added basic precautions, such as extra cleaning, markers on the ground to direct foot traffic and more space between desks. Some plan to reduce overall numbers present by keeping some staff working at home or staggering shifts, and others plan to set up their own testing."/>
						<outline text="Other companies said these moves don't go far enough."/>
						<outline text="RXR, the real-estate company, is testing new systems on its own employees. ''We are using ourselves as the guinea pigs,'' RXR's Chief Executive Scott Rechler said."/>
						<outline text="The company aims to have its social-distancing app ready at the end of May. Workers' movements are tracked through their smartphones'--you get a higher score the more time in the office you are farther than 6 feet from another person. An individual would see his or her own score, and the employer would see aggregate data on how employees are complying with social distancing as a whole."/>
						<outline text="After the pandemic, RXR said the technology could be used to ensure the most efficient use of space and ''the overall wellness of our customers.''"/>
						<outline text="Interpublic, whose ad agencies employ 9,700 people in New York City, began to think about how to safely bring back staffers in early April. After consultation with Dr. Ossmann, the company is exploring options including a system of classifying its U.S. employees in one of three levels."/>
						<outline text="A worker that tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, indicating they had the infection in the past, would be considered a ''Level 1'' employee'--the lowest risk'--and could return to work when states and cities lift work-from-home orders."/>
						<outline text="Those without antibodies but who are considered a low to moderate risk would count as ''Level 2.'' This group would include employees who are under 65 years old, don't live with high-risk people and don't have chronic diseases including diabetes or hypertension. This group could potentially return to work in a second wave."/>
						<outline text="Employees over 65, or those who are pregnant, smoke, have chronic diseases or health issues would be considered ''Level 3.'' These at-risk employees would have to wait the longest to return, Dr. Ossmann said."/>
						<outline text="A potential sticking point, said Casey Tinnesz,  Interpublic's senior director of crisis management and business continuity, is that personal medical information about employees is private."/>
						<outline text="Dr. Ossmann has also advised Interpublic that there are shortcomings with Covid-19 antibody testing, including that some tests falsely show people have antibodies to the virus."/>
						<outline text="Measuring proximityOther companies have expressed interest in contact-tracing tools so they can pinpoint which employees may have been exposed to the virus, without needing to shut down entire floors of an office or individual manufacturing plants, said Tom Puthiyamadam,  digital products leader at PwC. He said he and his colleagues host about 15 meetings a day with current and potential clients to explain the company's new tracing app."/>
						<outline text="The product, installed on an employee's phone, uses Bluetooth and Wi-Fi data, along with other signals, to determine employees' proximity to each other within a company building. It doesn't track someone's location or analyze data outside of work, Mr. Puthiyamadam said."/>
						<outline text="If an employee tests positive for the coronavirus, HR administrators can log in to a web portal to determine which other employees may be at risk based on their proximity to that worker in a given time period."/>
						<outline text="Companies are also doing more to screen arrivals and prevent sick people from entering buildings in the first place. Some employers are now evaluating whether to send a daily questionnaire to workers early every morning, asking staffers how they feel, said Larry Gadea,  chief executive of workplace software platform Envoy Inc."/>
						<outline text="He said at least one large technology client has asked the company to build such a tool. Envoy's software, used to check-in visitors, track packages and book meeting rooms, is used in 14,000 offices."/>
						<outline text="Answers to the questionnaire could determine who gains access to the office. Those feeling ill would be reminded to stay home, while employees who respond in a satisfactory way could be given a code to scan in an office lobby to gain entry."/>
						<outline text="Access management company            Okta  Inc.       might require employees who want to work in one of their 12 global offices to register a day in advance and go through a health and safety check that includes questions about their temperature and other potential symptoms, according to the company's senior vice president of global workplace services Armen Vartanian."/>
						<outline text="Feevr, a thermal imaging device developed by X.Labs, said it is launching a precheck option loosely modeled on the Transportation Security Administration's precheck system at airports. The goal is to reduce lines at buildings of people waiting to have their temperatures checked."/>
						<outline text="Employees can log into Feevr's app at home every morning through a facial scan and take their temperature with a digital thermometer. The app sends the temperature to the employer with a timestamp. If it is below the fever threshold, the employee gets a pass for the day."/>
						<outline text="Envoy's Mr. Gadea said many employers plan to ask guests if they are experiencing symptoms of Covid-19, and how they got to the office. Public transit is viewed as riskier than private cars."/>
						<outline text="There are still few agreed upon standards on what tools are effective, and how they should be used while respecting individual privacy, said Steven Feldstein,  an associate professor at Boise State University, who studies digital surveillance."/>
						<outline text="''We're in a bit of a Wild West,'' he said. ''In the absence of federal guidelines in the U.S. or other even kind of less explicit formal regulations, but just norms, it's a little bit of a free for all right now in terms of who's doing what.''"/>
						<outline text="Some employees might push back on contact-tracing efforts, perhaps by turning off their phones when meeting with people, NYU's Mr. Schultz said. Employers should clarify to workers what will likely happen if they are forced to self quarantine or take time away from the office, he said."/>
						<outline text="Existing employment laws that protect against discrimination by age or disability still apply in a pandemic, and asking all employees to disclose health information could open a company to legal liability, said Jennifer Merrigan Fay,  an employment-law partner at Goodwin Procter LLP."/>
						<outline text="Companies have some additional leeway in a pandemic, she said. The White House's return-to-work guidelines call for employers to make accommodations for vulnerable workers, including those who are elderly or with serious underlying health conditions. That could include allowing people to continue doing their jobs from home."/>
						<outline text="''If employers are telling people that they cannot come back to work, or that they have to disclose information if they are asymptomatic about their health, I think that you'll absolutely see challenges to that,'' Ms. Merrigan Fay said."/>
						<outline text="At his building in Rockefeller Center, RXR's Mr. Rechler predicts office workers will get used to the new procedures, just as they did with security check-ins for visitors following 9/11."/>
						<outline text="Many workers then were nervous about returning to their high-rise offices, he recalled. Turnstiles in office lobbies became common, front desks started asking for ID cards and garages screened cars for bombs. These measures, once deemed extreme, helped people feel safe, and many are still in use today."/>
						<outline text="''Over time some of that anxiety went away, and I think the same thing will happen here,'' he said."/>

						<outline text="As Germany's constitutional court ruled that the European Central Bank could have exceeded its powers with a massive quantitative easing (QE) effort, the EU was quick to note that European law trumps that of member states."/>
						<outline text="In Tuesday's ruling, the Federal Constitutional Court said that the German government failed to challenge the QE programme, launched in 2015 and reactivated last year. The judges in Karlsruhe also ruled that the stimulus scheme, known as the Public Sector Purchase Program (PSPP), did not respect the ''principle of proportionality,'' signaling that the eurozone's central bank went too far with its mandate."/>
						<outline text="Read more"/>
						<outline text="''The ECB fails to conduct the necessary balancing of the monetary policy objective against the economic policy effects arising from the programme,'' the ruling reads. ''By unconditionally pursuing the PSPP's monetary policy objective'....while ignoring its economic policy effects, the ECB manifestly disregards the principle of proportionality.''"/>
						<outline text="Spokesman for the European Commission Eric Mamer was quick to respond to the decision, saying that despite the assessment of the German court the bloc reaffirms ''the primacy of EU law.'' "/>
						<outline text="The ruling also challenges the decision of the highest EU court, with the judges saying that the review of the latter was ''not comprehensible.'' In 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) ruled that the ECB's plan was valid and within the body's mandate. "/>
						<outline text="Asked for comment by Reuters, the EU's top court also pointed at precedence of the bloc's law over member states' national ones, but did not elaborate on the specific case. "/>
						<outline text="The German court ordered the country's central bank, the Bundesbank, to stop participating in the ECB's stimulus scheme in three months unless the ECB proves that the bond purchases are necessary. "/>
						<outline text="Also on rt.com              Covid-19 may plunge Germany into worst recession since WWII                            The ECB launched the controversial plan to boost the economy and keep inflation levels close to two percent back in 2015. The program was halted in 2018 and relaunched around a year later. The plan's total holdings were '¬2.7 trillion at the end of March, according to Bloomberg."/>
						<outline text="On top of that the central bank has launched an additional program to battle the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, planning to buy '¬750 billion of bonds this year to offset the economic consequences of the virus-related crisis. This aid was explicitly excluded from the court ruling, while some said that the decision may still create hurdles for mitigation of the crisis. "/>
						<outline text="The euro dropped 0.7 percent against the US as news of the German court's decision emerged. The ruling has also sent key indices in the European markets lower."/>

						<outline text="The agreement would be the latest effort to cultivate allies around NASA's plan to put humans and space stations on the moon within the next decade, and comes as the civilian space agency plays a growing role in implementing American foreign policy. The draft pact has not been formally shared with U.S. allies yet."/>
						<outline text="Notably, and now grabbing international headlines, Russia is to be excluded from the pact, which is already sounding like a 'NATO in space' alliance of sorts, due to its &quot;hostile&quot; actions which includes ''threatening'' satellite maneuvers toward US spy satellites in Earth orbit. "/>
						<outline text="Via APReuters continues: "/>
						<outline text="The Artemis Accords, named after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's new Artemis moon program, propose ''safety zones'' that would surround future moon bases to prevent damage or interference from rival countries or companies operating in close proximity."/>
						<outline text="The pact also aims to provide a framework under international law for companies to own the resources they mine, the sources said."/>
						<outline text="The report notes further the moon is expected to be a future jumping off point for similar exploration and mining possibilities on Mars. "/>
						<outline text="The White House has already named specific partner countries it expects to kickstart the moon mining pact with: "/>
						<outline text="In the coming weeks, U.S. officials plan to formally negotiate the accords with space partners such as Canada, Japan, and European countries, as well as the United Arab Emirates, opening talks with countries the Trump administration sees as having ''like-minded'' interests in lunar mining."/>
						<outline text="Russia, a major partner with NASA on the International Space Station, won't be an early partner in these accords, the sources said, as the Pentagon increasingly views Moscow as hostile..."/>
						<outline text="However, anonymous top US officials interviewed by Reuters sought to underscore: ''This isn't some territorial claim.''"/>

						<outline text="'-- Sarah Cammarata (@sarahjcamm) May 6, 2020''The idea is if you are going to be coming near someone's operations, and they've declared safety zones around it, then you need to reach out to them in advance, consult and figure out how you can do that safely for everyone,'' the source added."/>
						<outline text="But we highly doubt Moscow will see it like this, given it looks like Washington is trying to claim moon resources exclusively for itself and its allies, even before the futuristic sounding industry of 'moon mining' gets its start, not to mention the question of whether the technology exists to mine the moon on a large scale. "/>
						<outline text="An illustration by NASA shows Artemis astronauts on the moon, via AP.Since the launch of Trump's 'Space Force' - now officially the newest branch of the American military, critics warned of a coming and dangerous 'weaponization of space'.

						<outline text="Citing supply chain strains and anticipated shortages as a result of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the agency that manages military commissaries says some stores will start limiting how much fresh meat customers can purchase."/>
						<outline text="Starting May 1, commissaries within the 50 states and in Puerto Rico will limit purchases of fresh beef, poultry and pork, the Defense Commissary Agency announced Thursday evening. For fresh beef, pork, chicken and turkey, customers will be limited to purchasing two items per visit, according to the announcement."/>
						<outline text="&quot;There may be some shortages of fresh protein products in the coming weeks,&quot; Robert Bianchi, a retired Navy rear admiral and the Defense Department's special assistant for commissary operations, said in a statement. &quot;Enacting this policy now will help ensure that all of our customers have an opportunity to purchase these products on an equitable basis.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Military commissaries, located on military bases around the world, operate on a nonprofit basis and offer food items at cost. Considered a military benefit, they are open to active-duty troops, dependents, retirees and some other special veteran categories."/>
						<outline text="Related: Millions More Vets and Caregivers About to Get Commissary, Exchange Access"/>
						<outline text="Individual stores will have the ability to increase or decrease limits based on their inventory, DeCA officials added in the release. Some commissaries have already been posting quantity limits on high-demand items, such as toilet paper and hand sanitizer."/>
						<outline text="The move to limit meat purchases is a troubling one that comes on the heels of an announcement from Tyson Foods, one of the largest meat-processing companies in the nation, that it was being forced to close down plants due to the virus. Eventually, the company warned, the closures would lead to shortages in stores."/>
						<outline text="&quot;The food supply chain is breaking,&quot; company chairman John Tyson said in a full-page ad that appeared in the New York Times April 26."/>
						<outline text="On Tuesday, President Donald Trump issued an executive order ordering Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue to &quot;take all appropriate action under that section to ensure that meat and poultry processors continue operations,&quot; calling the plants &quot;critical infrastructure for the nation."/>
						<outline text="To that end, the administration will purchase $3 billion in excess dairy, produce and meat &quot;to be distributed in order to assist Americans in need as well as producers with lost markets,&quot; the White House said in an announcement accompanying the order."/>
						<outline text="In DeCA's Thursday announcement, Bianchi said the supply chain for commissaries overseas remained strong."/>
						<outline text="&quot;In addition, we continue to prioritize quantities for our overseas shipments, so we should be able to support the demand,&quot; he said. &quot;If we experience any unexpected major hiccups in the pipeline, we will look at expanding shopping limits to other locations.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="The release noted that purchase limits were also intended to head off the phenomenon of panic buying, which has led to bare shelves in supermarkets all over the country. As demand spiked, DeCA issued a March 14 directive allowing store managers to implement shopping limits as they saw fit to maintain stock availability. That directive remains in effect."/>
						<outline text="&quot;We know this is a potentially stressful time for all concerned,&quot; Bianchi said. &quot;But together we will meet these challenges and support our service members and their families throughout the duration of this crisis wherever necessary.&quot;"/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="The coronavirus pandemic has left Washington's farmers with at least a billion pounds of potatoes they can't sell, a new crop growing without any buyers and millions of dollars in debt they have no way to pay.Jeanette Marantos reports for the Los Angeles Times."/>
						<outline text="The state's fertile Columbia Basin produces nearly a quarter of the potatoes grown in the United States, 10 billion pounds in 2019. The vast majority '-- 90% '-- were turned into frozen French fries and shipped to restaurants, some in the United States but mostly to Asia."/>
						<outline text="Demand has increased steadily since 2008, said Chris Voigt, executive director of the Washington State Potato Commission, and last year the region's processors had more orders than spuds. This year was shaping up to be the same until the coronavirus closed restaurants and schools around the globe."/>
						<outline text="Normally, Farmer Marvin Wollman's storage sheds would be nearly empty this time of year, but more than half his potatoes '-- ''Let's just say millions of pounds'' '-- are still piled high in the cavernous buildings, which are roughly the size of a football field with roofs nearly 30 feet high."/>
						<outline text="''We're afraid there's still going to be potatoes in storage when we go to dig up this year's crop in September,'' Wollman said. ''These are good potatoes. We don't want to throw them away. It's just, what do you do with them?''"/>
						<outline text="As it turns out, getting rid of a billion pounds of spuds isn't easy '-- or cheap. It usually takes Washington farmers a year to sell that quantity to grocery stores."/>
						<outline text="''Now we're trying to move it in a couple months,'' Voigt said."/>
						<outline text="That means each of the 2 million citizens expected to use the state's food banks this year would have to take 500 pounds."/>
						<outline text="And moving all those potatoes would require filling at least 20,000 tractor-trailers '-- and paying for fuel."/>
						<outline text="The potato commission helped cover the cost of bagging and transporting Wollman's potatoes '-- about 7 cents a bag '-- to see what was possible. Voigt said it has also started a GoFundMe page to raise $100,000 to cover the costs of giving away another million pounds of potatoes around the state over the next few weeks."/>
						<outline text="That would still leave more than 999 million pounds in storage."/>

						<outline text="Congress recently approved $9.5 billion for the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program to help farmers with crops they can't sell. The maximum relief for single-commodity farmers is $125,000, but most borrow millions each year to cover their costs until their crop can be sold."/>
						<outline text="''It's like you're drowning in nine feet of water, and we take an inch away,'' said Rep. Kim Schrier, a freshman Washington Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee. ''You're still drowning.''"/>
						<outline text="Washington potato farmers hope the U.S. Department of Agriculture will step in and buy their billion-pound glut, then donate the potatoes to food banks or even cattle ranchers as supplemental livestock feed."/>
						<outline text="Schrier said she couldn't answer whether that was likely."/>
						<outline text="JM Farms '-- named for its husband-and-wife owners, Jordan and Mia Reed '-- is facing an extra disadvantage compared to many other potato farmers: They grow only Ranger russets."/>
						<outline text="The elongated shape makes that ''long, perfect French fry'' favored by McDonald's and other chains, Jordan said. But unlike other varieties '--including Umatillas, Clearwaters and Caribous '-- Rangers can not be stored."/>
						<outline text="Last October, the Reeds secured contracts from the region's two potato processors and a $1.7-million loan to cover expenses. In March, they planted 485 acres of Ranger russets."/>
						<outline text="Then the processors called in April and canceled 75% of their contracts. They explained that the demand for fries had disappeared and their freezers were full. Suddenly the Reeds were growing 364 acres of potatoes with no place to go'..."/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="Among the greatest honors of my life was a trip I took to Memphis in October of 2018 to visit the National Civil Rights Museum and receive the institution's annual Freedom Award. While I was there, I had a chance to stand on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel where Dr. King was assassinated half a century earlier, and reflect on all of the progress we'd made '-- and that which we hadn't '-- in the years since that unbearable day."/>
						<outline text="The motel balcony leads back into Dr. King's room '-- a room preserved just as it was on the night he was taken from us. The bed is unmade. Coffee cups are scattered on the table. There is a restless spirit in that room '-- of a dream deferred; of unfinished business."/>
						<outline text="The night before Dr. King was assassinated, he stood at the pulpit at Mason Temple and delivered what turned out to be his final sermon '-- a call to support sanitation workers who were striking for better pay. He commanded the congregation: ''Let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge, to make America what it ought to be.''"/>
						<outline text="Fifty-two years later, his charge remains as vital as it was that night. We have made extraordinary strides along so many fronts '-- but for African American families, we have not yet made America what it ought to be. The truth is, African Americans can never have a fair shot at the American Dream so long as entrenched disparities are still allowed to chip away at opportunity. You don't have an equal chance when your schools are substandard, when your home is undervalued, when your car insurance costs more for no good reason, or when the poverty rate for African Americans is more than twice what it is for whites."/>
						<outline text="I believe that the moral obligation of our time is to rebuild our economy in a way that finally brings everyone along. That goal has always been the core of my candidacy '-- it's the very reason that I am running for President. And achieving it starts by rooting out systemic racism from our laws, our policies, our institutions, and our hearts."/>
						<outline text="This mission is more urgent now than ever before, as the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 have exposed '-- and cruelly exacerbated '-- the disparities long faced by African Americans. In April, I called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to collect more data that would shed light on how COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting communities, including breaking down its impacts by race. The data we've seen so far suggests that African Americans are dying from COVID-19 at a far higher rate than whites. African Americans represent an especially high percentage of the front-line workers putting themselves at greater risk to sustain the economy and keep the rest of the country safe and fed '-- and are less likely to have a job they can do from home, forcing them to make the difficult choice between their health and a paycheck. Long-standing systemic inequalities may also be contributing to this disparity '-- including the fact that African Americans are more likely to be uninsured. While there's a lot we don't yet know about COVID-19, we do know that equitable distribution of resources '-- like testing and medical equipment '-- can make a difference in fighting the virus. We must make that a priority and take action now."/>
						<outline text="The virus is also having a disproportionate economic impact on African American families. African American small businesses have been hit hard, and over 90% of African American-owned businesses are estimated to be shut out of the initial relief program due to preexisting, systemic disparities in lending. This is especially dire given that African American families have less of a financial cushion to fall back on in hard times. Since the onset of this crisis, I have been calling for the nation's relief and recovery efforts to be equitable and just, including by designing relief programs in ways that steer clear of methods we know lead to disparate outcomes '-- so that funds can actually reach African American families, communities, and small businesses. Unfortunately, Donald Trump has failed to listen or act. If I were President today, I would make it a top priority to ensure that African American workers, families, and small businesses got the relief they need and deserve."/>
						<outline text="This is not a new priority for me '-- tackling systemic racism and fighting for civil rights is what brought me to public service as a local councilman in the years just after Dr. King's death, and it has been a driving force throughout my career ever since. I was proud to fight against discriminatory school district funding and housing practices in my own community as a young man '-- and prouder still of the work I did in the U.S. Senate, co-sponsoring the Civil Rights Act of 1990 to protect against employment discrimination, leading efforts to reauthorize and extend the Fair Housing Act, and spearheading multiple reauthorizations of the Voting Rights Act to protect African Americans' right to vote."/>
						<outline text="This moment demands an overwhelming moral response. We need a comprehensive agenda for African Americans '-- a plan with the ambition to match the scale of the challenge, and one that recognizes that race-neutral policies are not a sufficient response to race-based disparities."/>
						<outline text="Today, I'm releasing a new plan to achieve equity for the African American community and take us one step closer to making America what it ought to be. The six pillars of my plan are as follows:"/>
						<outline text="Advance the economic mobility of African Americans and close the racial wealth and income gap by investing in African American workers, businesses, and communities, and expanding African American homeownership and wealth building;Expand access to high-quality education and tackle racial inequity in our education system by investing in universal preschool, closing funding gaps by race, making college affordable, and tackling the student debt crisis;End health disparities by making far-reaching investments, expanding access to affordable health care, improving the quality of care African Americans receive, and making health equity a reality for African Americans;Strengthen America's commitment to justice by ending incarceration for drug use alone, reducing the number of people incarcerated, reinvesting those savings in communities affected by mass incarceration, and addressing systemic misconduct in police departments and prosecutors' offices;Make the right to vote and the right to equal protection real for African Americans by dramatically expanding the Department of Justice's ability to fight voter suppression and gerrymandering, bringing the full force of the federal government's authority to confront voter disinformation efforts targeting African Americans, and appointing a federal judiciary that looks like America;Address environmental justice by making historic investments, enforcing environmental justice legislation, and ensuring that African Americans are dealt in on the country's clean energy future.This plan will tackle some of the most stubborn and pervasive issues '-- including those that often go unnoticed '-- that hold back African Americans from receiving an equal shot."/>
						<outline text="African American entrepreneurs seeking capital are rejected at a rate nearly 20 percent higher than white entrepreneurs, and receive far less support when they do get funding. We're going to fix that by doubling the State Small Business Credit Initiative, doubling funding for a program that supports mission-driven lenders in low-income communities, expanding the New Markets Tax Credit to draw tens of billions of dollars to invest in communities that need it, and shoring up the Small Business Administration's budget and expanding the agency's programs that have proven most effective at helping African American-owned businesses get off the ground."/>
						<outline text="The first installment of the Paycheck Protection Program created in response to COVID-19 largely left out minority-owned businesses. We're going to fix that by providing entrepreneurs with technical assistance and legal and accounting support to ensure that they can apply for funding, producing a weekly dashboard to track exactly which businesses are receiving economic relief, and reserving half of all new relief funds for small businesses with 50 or fewer employees '-- a category that includes 98 percent of all minority- and women-owned businesses."/>
						<outline text="The gap between African American and white homeownership is larger today than it was when the Fair Housing Act was first passed in 1968 '-- a key contributor to the unacceptable racial wealth gap that persists between American households. We're going to fix that by investing $640 billion over ten years to ensure that every American has access to housing that is affordable and accessible, stable and safe, energy-efficient, and located near good schools. We'll create a tax credit of up to $15,000 for first-time homebuyers available at the moment they make their purchase, establish a new homeowners' and renters' bill of rights to bar deceptive and discriminatory practices and bring more accountability and oversight to mortgage brokers and landlords, end discrimination in credit reporting by creating a new public credit reporting agency to catch and eliminate racial disparities, and establish national standards for housing appraisals to put an end to the undervaluing of homes in African American neighborhoods."/>
						<outline text="The typical African American family holds about one-tenth the wealth of a typical white family '-- and the disparity has grown worse, not better, over the last fifty years. We're going to fix that by implementing Congressman Jim Clyburn's ''10''20''30'' Plan to ensure that federal programs are reaching persistently impoverished communities, and targeting new green infrastructure projects '-- and the good-paying jobs that come with them '-- to historically marginalized neighborhoods. In conjunction with that work, we'll expand on the Obama-Biden Administration's efforts to increase federal and state contracting opportunities for African American-owned businesses '-- including by increasing funds for the Minority Business Development Agency and expanding the work of its landmark Federal Procurement Center. We'll also close the digital divide by investing $20 billion in broadband infrastructure to reach underserved communities and passing the Digital Equity Act. And we'll make it easier for African Americans to retire with dignity by revamping employer retirement plans and putting them within reach of far more workers '-- and by making Social Security benefits more generous and equitable."/>
						<outline text="For too long, African Americans have not been adequately dealt into the middle class. We're going to fix that by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act and ending unequal pay, getting our essential workers the pay, protections, and dignity they deserve, strengthening public and private sector unions, and raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour. We'll provide high-quality, universal pre-K for every three- and four-year old in America, so that every child gets off to a good start '-- and close the funding gap between white and non-white school districts to ensure that African American families can thrive across generations. We'll tackle the student debt crisis '-- which disproportionately burdens African Americans '-- make public colleges and universities tuition-free for families with incomes below $125,000, and invest more than $70 billion in HBCUs and minority-serving institutions to equip the next generation of African American professionals to succeed."/>
						<outline text="There is much, much more to my plan '-- after all, the roots of inequity are sprawling, and touch nearly every corner of American policy and society. We need to take serious steps to reduce racial health disparities, and we need to put an end to forces that profit off of our criminal justice system. We need to restore the Voting Rights Act, and we need to ensure that every community has access to safe drinking water. Building a more equitable nation will require a broad and coordinated push across the full scope of our government and society '-- but it can, and must, be done."/>
						<outline text="I encourage you to read the full details of my plan here. And I look forward to making it a reality with the help of lawmakers, community leaders, and families across the country who aspire to the dream of Dr. King. In his words: ''Let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge, to make America what it ought to be.''"/>

						<outline text="Ukraine's ex-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has stunned the public and media by saying in her income declaration that she got $5.5 million from a ''US resident'' as compensation for Ukrainian government ''repressions.''"/>
						<outline text="A financial disclosure statement filed in late April by Tymoshenko, who now serves as an MP in Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada, says she received a whopping 148 million hryvnias ($5.5 million) as part of a pre-trial settlement in a case filed over her persecution at the hands of the Ukrainian authorities back in 2011-2014."/>
						<outline text="Yet, Tymoshenko's declaration doesn't disclose anything about the lawsuit, besides the name of an American law firm, Reid Collins &amp;amp; Tsai LLP, as the source of the tranche. The legal company's website mentions nothing about any cases related to the former Ukrainian prime minister."/>

Yet, her post left more questions than answers since she only said she reached a pre-trial settlement with a ''US resident'' in the case dealing with her persecution in Ukraine."/>
						<outline text="Back in 2011, she was sentenced to seven years in prison on charges of abuse of power. The case was related to a 2009 gas deal she struck with Russia. The case sparked an angry reaction in European capitals as well as in Washington, which all called it politically motivated. The European Court of Human Rights declared her sentence to be ''illegal,'' European leaders called for a boycott of Kiev and the US Senate threatened Ukraine with sanctions over the issue."/>
						<outline text="Moscow also criticized Kiev over its treatment of Tymoshenko. The then-president, Dmitry Medvedev, called her case ''a political affair'' and said that persecution of a political opponent is ''absolutely unacceptable'' and ''casts a shadow'' on both Ukraine and ''those who make such decisions.''"/>
						<outline text="Eventually, Tymoshenko spent just about a year behind bars and two more in a hospital as she suffered from a spine disorder. She was freed during the 2014 Maidan coup that toppled former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich."/>

							<outline text="Flynn almost assuredly became Target Zero for his willingness to expose and undo what Obama considered his signature foreign policy achievement, the Iran nuclear deal.

							<outline text="On February 26, 2016, the conspirators began their sabotage campaign against Flynn with an article in  Yahoo News.

							<outline text="The co-author of that article was one Mark Hosenball.

							<outline text="In 2016, Hosenball was still apparently carrying water for the intelligence community. Three sources, allegedly ''former foreign policy officials in past administrations,'' tipped him off to this seemingly ominous news of Flynn's softness on Russia."/>
							<outline text="In retrospect, what makes the article suspect is that Russia had not yet become the media's public enemy number one, let alone the White House's. In July 2015, for instance, Obama called Russian President Vladimir Putin to thank him for his help securing the Iran nuclear pact."/>
							<outline text="Obama had reason to be grateful. No foreign leader had more influence over the mullahs than Putin.

							<outline text="In July 2015, it was still respectable for an American president to collaborate with Putin.

							<outline text="For eight years, the headlines went wherever Obama directed them.

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="Commentary"/>
						<outline text="The more we learn about the evils done to Michael Flynn, and they increase day by day, the more the FBI comes to resemble the KGB."/>
						<outline text="Or is it the earlier version, the NKVD, whose leader, Lavrentiy Beria, famously declared, ''Show me the man and I'll find you the crime.''"/>
						<outline text="James Comey'--the head of the FBI during this period of extraordinary moral turpitude'--never said anything anywhere near that pithy or memorable, but he did Beria one better. He, with then-agent Peter Strzok, whose feckless emails to his paramour continue to amaze, and various other bit players of this sorry saga'--some revealed others yet to be revealed'--didn't just find a crime, they invented one."/>
						<outline text="In all fairness, the Soviets, pre and post-Beria, often did the same, putting the darkness in ''Darkness at Noon,'' with forced confessions as in the Metro-Vickers Affair (1933), when innocent Brits took the hit for the failure of Stalin's ''five-year plan.''"/>
						<outline text="What was really going on with what was essentially the ''forced confession'' of Flynn?"/>
						<outline text="Former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy said on Tucker Carlson on April 30 that Flynn wasn't the target; it was Trump. Flynn was just a ''seasoned intelligence professional'' (McCarthy's words) who had to be implicated and put out of the way in order to reach the president, the real bullseye."/>
						<outline text="That's likely true, but it's also likely that wasn't the only reason. Flynn was by himself a target."/>
						<outline text="During the transition, it's said that Barack Obama gave incoming President Donald Trump two pieces of advice on whom he considered to be the current greatest threats to the United States, so the new president could be forearmed'--Kim Jong Un and Flynn."/>
						<outline text="Michael Flynn? (I'd add several exclamation points and question marks, but it's tacky.) Why would he be of anywhere near that importance to be put in the same conversation as the nuclear-armed dictator of North Korea?"/>
						<outline text="The answer, I believe, is a four-letter word: Iran."/>
						<outline text="The Iran deal (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA) was, with the Affordable Care Act, one of the twin pillars of Obama's presidency on which he wanted to base his legacy."/>
						<outline text="I'm not going into here the many theories of why, beyond that legacy, Obama was so attached to the JCPOA, but, by the time Trump was elected, it was already under heavy criticism due to the Islamic Republic's violent activities in the Syrian civil war and elsewhere, arming Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and other proxies with money that came via America and'--naive as it now sounds'--were supposed to be for the improvement of the lives of the Iranian people."/>
						<outline text="Flynn was known to have been one of the most adamant opponents of the Iran deal within the Obama administration and, with his military record as a three-star general plus aforementioned intelligence expertise, perhaps the most powerful one."/>
						<outline text="So bringing down Flynn was a twofer, striking a blow at the new president while hopefully helping to preserve the Iran deal. The second part didn't work, but the first did '... for a while."/>
						<outline text="It's therefore not totally surprising'--what is these days?'--that the newly revealed documents have ''SCO'' (special counsel's office) scrawled on them, among other incriminating notes indicating a ''setup'' was in the cards for Flynn."/>
						<outline text="That means these statements exculpating Trump's newly appointed national security adviser went to Mueller's office, where someone (Mueller? Weissman?) ignored them and continued with what Trump has colloquially, and I think too loosely, branded a ''hoax.'' It was far more than that. It was a form of defenestration."/>
						<outline text="When we look for the Mr. Big in all this, as we are tempted to do as'--we can be more confident now'--more rolls out, we shouldn't settle for Comey, as culpable as he may be. This bizarre character who self-identified on Twitter as the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr isn't the end to the story."/>
						<outline text="We are looking at a Netflix series with a plot that gets increasingly complicated. It goes past Comey and into the intelligence agencies and the State Department'--a real-life version of ''Scandal'' with, I regret to tell showrunner Shonda Rhimes, the liberals and progressives almost always the villains."/>
						<outline text="When it reaches then-CIA Director Brennan and Obama, it may not even end there. Maybe even U.S. Attorney John Durham doesn't know. (Kidding. I hope.)"/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="A former co-worker of Peter Strzok tells Big League Politics about Strzok's extensive background in the intelligence community, including the fact that he grew up in Iran. Many intelligence officers like Strzok are complete ghosts with questionable history and gaps in their life story. But now we have some insight. (RELATED: Strzok Worked For CIA And FBI At Same Time, According To Document)."/>
						<outline text="Peter Strzok was born in the late 1960's '' he attended the American School in Iran up until 1978 when it closed down and then he attended the American School in Saudi Arabia. He supposedly attended a Catholic School, St. John's Prep in Minneapolis (the school refused to confirm or deny attendance) and then completed a Bachelors at Georgetown and some form of graduate degree after that."/>
						<outline text="The truth is that after Peter Strzok III turned 18 his life is arcane, which is the usual story of many like him. Did you know that Peter Strzok II (Strzok's father) and Hillary Clinton have a lot in common? It turns out after advocating for Khomeni in Iran and then working in Saudi Arabia to calm the waters of an Iranian government (appeasing them with anti-Semitic rhetoric), Strzok's father Strzok II also dabbled in ''charity work.'' Strzok's father was involved in so-called charity work in Haiti but also helped dismantle and reassemble Upper Volta..now known as Burkina Faso."/>
						<outline text="Despite Deep State efforts to scrub information, the Internet is forever. Below you will see a very controversial happening in the early Eighties. Peter Strzok II (Strzok's father, also known as Peter Strzok Sr.) was an employee of Catholic Relief Services and was interviewed by the New York Times in 1985 over his testimony or statements regarding mishandling money intended for Ethopia. In the article he identifies himself as a former employee of the charity and he is a retired US Army Corps Engineer who served the agency in Africa and Haiti. So Peter Strzok II worked in Haiti with a charity? That sounds eerily familiar. Can we all guess which charities partnered to help Haiti?"/>
						<outline text="Trending:   DOCUMENT: Peter Strzok Was CIA And FBI At The Same Time, Say Experts"/>
						<outline text="The Clinton Foundation and The Catholic Relief Services (CRS) seem to work in tangent. Coincidence? Peter Strzok Sr. was actually the director of CRS in Haiti. If we look into CRS financials they seem to overlap and feed into Clinton Global initiatives and balance sheets."/>
						<outline text="In the early 80's Upper Volta was in turmoil. It is said that mineral disputes with neighboring countries brought about great duress and so in 1985 the country of Upper Volta ceased to exist and was then named Burkina Faso during Strzok II's term there. Specifically, in 1981 he was advised of a government visit to Upper Volta, which places him in Upper Volta for a period of 4 years as his son Strzok III was at the American School in Saudi Arabia from 1978- 1980. This happened after their sudden move from Tehran when Khomeni attained power over the Shah. Looks like whenever there is a regime change in modern history a Strzok is lying in the shadows waiting."/>
						<outline text="We know Peter Strzok III, the man who sent those vile text messages about our President. The man who was biased and wanted to ensure a Clinton Presidency was raised in Iran and Saudi Arabia."/>
						<outline text="Our source reveals how Strzok and his father both talked about Iran favorably and both accidently reminisced about the rose water smell of the ju-jeh kebab by Shemiran Hill'... something that disappeared after 1987 and only those who are old enough to remember can discuss."/>
						<outline text="Peter Strzok's Persian is impeccable."/>
						<outline text="Our insider tells us that Peter Strzok III is the key Middle Eastern Intel operative for the Iranian airline Mahan Air's purchase of United States government planes during the Obama administration from 2011 to 2013 (when Iran sanctions were in place). He handled the Iranian relations from start to finish. Just like his father did for Reagan and just like he's been doing for years under cloak and dagger says the BLP insider."/>
						<outline text="Peter Strzok Sr. and of course John O. Brennan were involved with Iran. In fact, our source tells us that Strzok Sr. was involved in the Iran-Contra scheme that led to a six-month prison term for Reagan national security adviser John Poindexter. Back in the Eighties the government was just as corrupt as it is today and for some reason we keep giving weapons, planes, and planes full of money to Iran. Even Barack Hussein Obama sent money to Iran on a plane in his last year of office '-- $1.4 Billion worth. Just a few weeks ago, Iran demanded Germany send them 300,000 Euros in cash on a plane to them, and of course Angela Merkel complied. What's the deal with Iran? Why are they so important?"/>
						<outline text="Here is a clipping from the Wisconsin-based Leader-Telegram newspaper from 1979 in which Strzok Sr. describes his activities in Iran and expresses good will for the Ayatollah."/>
						<outline text="What were Strzok, Brennan, and Obama really doing? That is a very good question that maybe President Trump can get answered for us if a Summit with Iran can happen early this fall. One thing that is constant in modern history over the last five decades with anything involving Iran: There is a Peter Paul Strzok involved."/>
						<outline text="The BLP insider who's worked with both Breannan and Strzok tells us that Strzok was never FBI he was part of the highest level of covert operatives, sliding into posts within the CIA or FBI to infiltrate, influence and observe. This is exactly what we saw with the Special Counsel appointment that resulted after a failed operation."/>
						<outline text="Peter Strzok Jr. was placed in the FBI to ensure a win for Hillary Clinton and buffer negative press (like the Weiner laptop case, which he covered up). That's the real deal. Revealing Peter Strzok's identity would have been a problem because it's called unmasking but since he is in the limelight and out of the shadows it's time to lay all the cards FACE up on the table for all to see who Peter Strzok really is."/>
						<outline text="Spooks feared him, but like our source they still maintain secrecy '-- simply connecting the dots of publicly and privately available information."/>

						<outline text="AbstractTechnological devices have become essential components of daily life. However, their deleterious effects on the body, particularly on the nervous system, are well known. Electromagnetic fields (EMF) have various chemical effects, including causing deterioration in large molecules in cells and imbalance in ionic equilibrium. Despite being essential for life, oxygen molecules can lead to the generation of hazardous by-products, known as reactive oxygen species (ROS), during biological reactions. These reactive oxygen species can damage cellular components such as proteins, lipids and DNA. Antioxidant defense systems exist in order to keep free radical formation under control and to prevent their harmful effects on the biological system. Free radical formation can take place in various ways, including ultraviolet light, drugs, lipid oxidation, immunological reactions, radiation, stress, smoking, alcohol and biochemical redox reactions. Oxidative stress occurs if the antioxidant defense system is unable to prevent the harmful effects of free radicals. Several studies have reported that exposure to EMF results in oxidative stress in many tissues of the body. Exposure to EMF is known to increase free radical concentrations and traceability and can affect the radical couple recombination. The purpose of this review was to highlight the impact of oxidative stress on antioxidant systems."/>

						<outline text="Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance of anti- and pro-oxidative reactions in favor of the pro-oxidant, which leads to a condition where the production of ROS exceeds the capacity of a biological system to readily detoxify the reactive intermediates or to repair the resulting damage.37,38"/>

						<outline text="Oxidative stress  occurs when excess oxygen radicals are produced in cells, which could overwhelm the normal antioxidant capacity. When the concentration of reactive species is not controlled by internal defense mechanisms such as antioxidants (tocopherols, ascorbic acid, and glutathione) or enzymes involved in oxygen radical scavenging (catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase, SOD), oxidative damage occurs to proteins, lipids, and DNA, which could lead to cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and even carcinogenesis when damaged (mutated) cells can proliferate. Oxidative stress could results from the following: (1) the presence of xenobiotics, (2) the activation of the immune system in response to invading microorganisms (inflammation), and (3) radiation, which makes oxidative stress a common denominator of toxicity or stress. In this chapter, the reader will find a variety of assays to measure oxidative stress and damage."/>

						<outline text="Oxidative Stress  Oxidative stress  can induce the NFÎºÎ² pathway, increasing levels of inflammation.  8  The opposite can also occur, where chronic inflammation causes oxidative stress. Both oxidative stress and inflammation can activate pathways contributing to muscle protein degradation and PEW. Oxidative stress modifies proteins, making them resistant to ubiquitination. 100  In addition, heavily oxidized proteins form covalent bonds with each other to severely inhibit proteolysis, in turn leading to buildup of protein aggregates in the cell. 101  A study in patients with CKD stages 1''4 showed oxidative stress increased with worsening kidney function, and oxidative stress significantly inversely correlated with GFR. 102  Studies in dialysis patients also show that overall secretion of malonaldehyde and carbonyl protein from the muscle acts as a marker of increased generation of reactive oxygen species. 103"/>

						<outline text="11.11 Conclusion Oxidative stress  plays an important role in many disease states. In this chapter, diseases for which the role of oxidative stress is firmly established have been discussed. Certainly, this list may grow in the future. In addition, there are also many diseases for which an indirect association with oxidative stress has been suggested, but further research is needed to establish a firm correlation between these diseases and the role of oxidative stress in their pathophysiology. These diseases have not been addressed in this chapter. Currently, healthy lifestyle and intake of generous amounts of antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables are strongly recommended to combat oxidative stress. Antioxidant supplements may be helpful in certain diseases in which oxidative stress plays an important role, but antioxidant supplements must be taken only if recommended by a physician."/>

						<outline text="Role of Oxidative Stress in Neurodegenerative Diseases and Other Diseases Related to Aging  Amitava Dasgupta PhD, DABCC, Kimberly Klein MD, in   Antioxidants in Food, Vitamins and Supplements , 2014"/>
						<outline text="10.1 Introduction   Oxidative stress  has been implicated in numerous disease processes. Because the burden of disease in individuals increases with age, many investigators have postulated that oxidative stress may be involved in the process of aging as well as certain diseases related to advanced age, such as Alzheimer's disease. Numerous studies have directly linked aging to oxidative stress. This chapter discusses the role of oxidative stress in aging and the link between oxidative stress and various neurodegenerative diseases that are more common in advanced age. As discussed throughout the book, the best defense against oxidative stress is a balanced diet with generous servings of fruits and vegetables each day, regular exercise, and a healthy lifestyle. Antioxidant vitamins and supplements do not have any added benefit for healthy individuals. In fact, such supplements may cause more harm than good. Antioxidant vitamins and supplements must be taken only under medical advice. Various age-related diseases linked to oxidative stress are listed in   Box 10.1 ."/>

						<outline text="Oxidative Stress  Oxidative stress  is a state of imbalance between free radical production and their degradation by antioxidant systems with increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tissues and organs. Oxidative stress is an important phenomenon that contributes to hypertension and links hypertension with CKD and its complications.  49''51  Oxidative stress has also been increasingly linked to the high incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with CKD. 52,53"/>
						<outline text="Markers of oxidative stress, such as advanced oxidation protein products 54  and F2 isoprostanes, 55,56  are increased in CKD and inversely correlated with GFR, suggesting that oxidative stress may have an important effect on the decline in renal function or vice versa. Mechanisms for the increased oxidative stress in CKD have been described in detail in several reviews and include a combination of increased ROS production and reduced activities (or clearance) of several antioxidant pathways."/>

						<outline text="Anti-oxidants  Oxidative stress  is important in severe asthma and COPD, particularly during exacerbations   [26] . Oxidative stress activates the proinflammatory transcription factors NF-ÎºB and activator protein-1 (AP-1), resulting in enhanced inflammation. Oxidative stress is increased in patients with COPD, particularly during exacerbations, and reactive oxygen species contribute to its pathophysiology. Oxidative stress reduces steroid responsiveness via a reduction in histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2) activity and expression  [27] . This suggests that antioxidants may reverse corticosteroid resistance and also reduce inflammation. Unfortunately currently available antioxidants based on glutathione are relatively weak and are inactivated by oxidative stress, so new more potent and stable antioxidants are needed, such as superoxide dismutase mimics and NADPH oxidase inhibitors  [28] ."/>

						<outline text="Autophagy, Oxidative Stress, and Redox Regulation  Jipeng Ma, ... Jian Yang, in   Autophagy and Cardiometabolic Diseases , 2018"/>
						<outline text="20.3 Conclusion and Perspective Oxidative stress  and autophagy pathway are considered to be vital in pathologies of diverse cardiac diseases. Oxidative stress and cellular ROS generation can regulate autophagy at multiple levels and autophagy in turn attenuates oxidative stress to maintain cell homeostasis as a prosurvival response via a negative feedback regulation. Consistent with this, genetic models with disruptions of autophagy display increased ROS generation and accumulation of damaged components which are involved in the pathology of diverse diseases. However, it is possible that ROS-induced autophagy can lead to cell death under severe oxidative stress in particular pathologic conditions. It is still missing to identify the key regulators and precise mechanisms on how autophagy is regulating cell death and survival in response to oxidative stress. Although several mechanisms underlying the interplay of oxidative stress and autophagy are postulated, the translation of such mechanism into the treatments of diseases is still a challenge. Considering the complexity of the network and the dual nature of autophagy, manipulation of autophagy in a quantitative manner may be an area of focus for treatment of cardiometabolic diseases."/>

						<outline text="When liberals look at Fox News, they tend to see Trump TV: a cable network that, with a few exceptions, has relentlessly pushed his policy objectives, and praised him in the terms that he loves. But that is not the way Donald Trump himself sees it. Trump loves that many Fox hosts are his loudest cheerleaders'--but any deviation from Trumpian orthodoxy he views as betrayal. He sees himself as responsible for the network's continued ratings success, and expects to be treated as such. In private, Trump reminds friends that Fox tried to derail his campaign during the 2016 Republican primary, and he vents that Fox owes its record ratings to him. ''At the end of day, Trump thinks he owns Fox. He thinks he made them,'' said a Republican who discussed Fox with Trump."/>
						<outline text="From the Archive: Tuesdays With Rupert Murdoch"/>
						<outline text="Trump's frustration with Fox has only intensified during the coronavirus pandemic. As the nation's COVID-19 death count rises, and Trump's poll numbers slide, Fox executives have sidelined the network's most flagrant coronavirus deniers. In late April Fox cut ties with MAGA stars Diamond and Silk after the duo promoted bizarre COVID-19 conspiracies, including speculation that the virus was man-made or that New York state was inflating deaths totals to hurt Trump politically."/>
						<outline text="Trump's view that Fox is insufficiently loyal has motivated him to look for a more reliable media partner. On April 26, he tweeted: ''The people who are watching @FoxNews, in record numbers (thank you President Trump), are angry. They want an alternative now. So do I!''"/>
						<outline text="Trump now is on the verge of having that alternative. According to sources, an investor group aligned with his son Don Jr. and the Dallas-based Hicks family has acquired a major stake in One America News Network, the fledgling conservative cable-news channel that features hosts like Jack Posobiec, a chief promoter of the Pizzagate conspiracy. ''[RNC co-chair] Tommy Hicks and Don Jr. have been looking to buy a station for Trump TV,'' said one source briefed on the talks. ''This is all about building a Fox competitor. Trump is really aiming to take down Fox,'' the person briefed on the deal told me. (A person close to Hicks said he resigned his position from the family business when he joined the RNC and isn't involved in the OANN deal)."/>
						<outline text="During impeachment, OANN distinguished itself by its brazen airing of pro-Trump propaganda. OANN ran a three-part series hosted by Rudy Giuliani promoting Trump's conspiracy that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that meddled in the 2016 election. Former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo'--the current spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services'--hosted a prime-time special titled: The Ukraine Hoax: Impeachment, Biden Cash, Mass Murder."/>
						<outline text="Sources said the deal has been dragging on for months, and hasn't yet closed. In January the Wall Street Journal reported that Hicks Equity Partners was in talks to invest $250 million to acquire OANN from parent company Herring Networks Inc. Sources told me OANN president Charles Herring was asking $300 million for the channel, a price the Trump group felt was too high (one source said the final price was around $200 million). It's unclear whether Don Jr. invested Trump family funds in the deal or was given equity. The infusion of cash will allow OANN to improve production values and expand its modest distribution of 35 million homes (Fox News is available in more than 90 million homes)."/>
						<outline text="''While Don has long enjoyed a close friendship with Tommy Hicks and his family, he is not part of any investment group looking to acquire OANN,'' a spokesperson for Donald Trump Jr. said in a statement. ''Should the Hicks family acquire the network, Don has no doubt that they will make OANN an even bigger success.''"/>
						<outline text="Hicks did not respond to requests for comment. Herring did not respond to an email seeking comment."/>
						<outline text="As the deal has been moving forward, Trump has been promoting OANN by calling on OANN reporters at White House briefings and tweeting favorably about the network's coverage. Over the weekend, he tweeted that AT&amp;amp;T is expanding OANN's distribution. ''I hate to be promoting AT&amp;amp;T, but @OANN is Great News, not Fake News. Everybody should be carrying them!''"/>
						<outline text="For Trump, the network serves as both a tactical weapon in the 2020 campaign and a strategic hedge in case he needs a new platform after November. One source told me that if Trump loses, he could use OANN as his post-presidential television platform to host shows. Controlling a network has been something Trump has been mulling since the 2016 election. Thinking he would lose, per the source, Trump dispatched his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to raise money to launch Trump TV. According to the source, Trump considered buying the Weather Channel, then owned by Blackstone, and converting it into a Trump TV network. The deal didn't go forward because Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman wanted $450 million, far more than the $300 million Trump was willing to pay. (A person close to Kushner denies this. A Blackstone spokesperson also denies the account.)"/>
						<outline text="''Trump's big thing was always to own a network and be a multibillionaire,'' the source said. ''If Trump loses, he can be on OANN all the time. And before he leaves office, he has months to pump it up.''This post has been updated to include a denial from Blackstone."/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="During Andy Lack's first tour of duty leading NBC News, he helped ''Dateline'' bounce back from a dark era in which producers admitted to manipulating elements of an investigative report on General Motors, and expanded the hours of the ''Today'' morning franchise, and ratings success followed. None of that prepared him for what lay in wait during his second time at the news unit's helm."/>
						<outline text="Lack, who is stepping down from NBCUniversal earlier than previously expected under a new reorganization set in motion by new CEO Jeff Shell, has been under scrutiny almost from the time he returned to NBCU in 2015. He joined the Comcast-owned media conglomerate while it was in the midst of a public-relations maelstrom around former ''NBC Nightly News'' anchor Brian Williams, and quickly moved through several other periods of tumult."/>
						<outline text="Lack, a colorful executive who has never been shy about experimenting with new concepts, was among the NBCU executives who wooed Megyn Kelly to NBCU from Fox News Channel, giving her two ill-fated programs and a massive multi-million dollar payout. He weathered criticism after former ''Today'' co-anchor Matt Lauer was fired from the network after allegations of sexual harassment surfaced. He had to contend with a roiled employee base and further opprobrium after NBC News allowed former host and reporter Ronan Farrow to take his work looking into harassment allegations made against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, which was started at NBC News, to a rival news operation, where its publication helped bring Weinstein to justice. Farrow, who wrote a 2019 book, ''Catch &amp;amp; Kill,'' about his time at NBC News, alleged executives there sought to obstruct his efforts  '' allegations NBC News has dismissed several times. Lack's personal life and conduct at past jobs became fodder for press investigations."/>
						<outline text="The Lauer ouster and the swirl of details contained in the Farrow book sparked concern internally and spurred activist organizations to call upon NBCU's parent, Comcast, to make changes at NBC News."/>
						<outline text="NBCUniversal investigated the news division in the wake of the Lauer firing. A report prepared by the company that was released in May of 2018 and greeted with some degree of skepticism said managers at the company's ''Today'' show and at NBC News had no knowledge of inappropriate behavior by the star anchor prior to his dismissal in November."/>
						<outline text="Critics charged Lack didn't heed the new rules of social interaction called for by movements like Time's Up and #MeToo. His supporters noted he kept focus on the business of news at NBCUniversal, lending new momentum to MSNBC after a period of fallow ratings; pushing NBC News into the digital era, with new content for Snapchat, Quibi and a recently-launched in-house streaming-video outlet; and expanding the company overseas. A move to launch a global news network based in London was recently delayed due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic."/>
						<outline text="Throughout his tenure, Lack enjoyed the support of Steve Burke, the company's previous CEO, who accepted some of the blame for the NBC's failure to turn Kelly into a success. ''In hindsight we shouldn't have done it,'' Burke told Variety in 2019. ''But it wasn't Andy going off rogue.'' Burke would continue to support Lack during his tenure, though in a re-organization of the company set last year, NBC News was placed under the oversight of an executive placed over Lack."/>
						<outline text="Cesar Conde, an executive whose chief role in recent years has been overseeing NBCU's international operations and its Spanish-language Telemundo network, will take over the company's news operations '' with a wider purview. Lack, who had oversight of CNBC during his first tenure, returned to the company to find CNBC's president, Mark Hoffman, had his own line of reporting to NBCU's  Burke. Under the new CEO's plan, CNBC will become part of a larger corporate division that houses the company's news operations."/>
						<outline text="NBCU declined to make Lack or Conde available for comment."/>
						<outline text="The installation of Conde in the news role interrupts a plan of succession that many expected to be completed by the end of the year. Under plans previously articulated by NBCU, Lack was expected to leave his role after the 2020 election. NBC News President Oppenheim was seen as his likely replacement.  One person familiar with the NBC News newsroom said some staffers had expressed hope after learning of the corporate changes that the news division might chart a period of calm under new management."/>
						<outline text="Unfortunately, there is still a chance for chaos in days to come. Staffers are worried about the potential for layoffs, according to another person familiar with the news division. The integration of CNBC into the NBC News and MSNBC operations will no doubt result in overlap of personnel behind the scenes and also on camera. Both news units have been growing their digital operations, and hiring reporters to cover such topics as media, politics and technology. An NBC News spokesman declined to comment on the potential for layoffs."/>

						<outline text="Thank you for this editorial. For the record, I'm a lifelong Democrat and will vote Democratic this fall, regardless. Defeating Donald Trump and saving our democracy is the most important thing. However, we still need a full, transparent investigation."/>
						<outline text="Making allegations of sexual assault is not easy. Those who do so deserve fair and thorough investigations. We demanded one with Brett Kavanaugh, and it's no different now. As a party, we cannot say we stand for sexual assault survivors, yet turn our backs when it's something we don't want to hear."/>
						<outline text="I'm disgusted by the attacks on Tara Reade, the insufficient mainstream media coverage, the slanted headlines and the flimsy excuses, such as that Joe Biden was already vetted when he ran for vice president. Hypocrisy looks bad no matter what side you're on. Innocent people have nothing to hide. They encourage full transparency. Yes, that means we need to look at the University of Delaware files.

I want a win, the removal of Donald Trump from office, and Mr. Biden is our best chance."/>

						<outline text="I do not know whether something occurred between then-Senator Joe Biden and Tara Reade, but I can say that it is highly unlikely that an event occurred as described. In 1993, a congressional staffer most likely would have been wearing something like a knee-length tailored skirt and pantyhose. It would be extremely difficult for someone to reach below the tight skirt, then bring his hand up to the waist and then down into the pantyhose. The fact that this supposedly occurred in a public corridor makes the story even more unlikely."/>

						<outline text="Rick Bright, the ousted chief of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency, said he was pressured to steer millions of dollars to the clients of a well-connected consultant."/>
						<outline text="Rick Bright said in a whistle-blower complaint that questionable contracts had gone to ''companies with political connections to the administration.''  Credit...   Toya Sarno Jordan/Bloomberg  WASHINGTON '-- A federal scientist who says he was ousted from his job amid a dispute over an unproven coronavirus treatment pushed by President Trump said Tuesday that top administration officials repeatedly pressured him to steer millions of dollars in contracts to the clients of a well-connected consultant."/>
						<outline text="Rick Bright, who was director of the Department of Health and Human Services' Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority until his removal in April, said in a formal whistle-blower complaint that he had been protesting ''cronyism'' and contract abuse since 2017."/>
						<outline text="Questionable contracts have gone to ''companies with political connections to the administration,'' the complaint said, including a drug company tied to a friend of Jared Kushner's, President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser. It said Dr. Bright was retaliated against by his superiors, who pushed him out because of ''his efforts to prioritize science and safety over political expediency.''"/>
						<outline text="The 89-page complaint, filed with the Office of Special Counsel, which protects federal whistle-blowers, also said Dr. Bright ''encountered opposition'' from department superiors '-- including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II '-- when he pushed as early as January for the necessary resources to develop drugs and vaccines to counter the emerging coronavirus pandemic."/>
						<outline text="The report provides a window into the inner workings of BARDA, a tiny agency created in 2006 as a response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. It partners with industry in developing ''medical countermeasures'' that can be stockpiled by the federal government to combat biological or chemical attacks and pandemic threats."/>
						<outline text="BARDA has spent billions of dollars on contracts with dozens of different suppliers, including major pharmaceutical companies and smaller biotechnology firms."/>
						<outline text="Both allies and Dr. Bright say his nearly four-year tenure as the head of BARDA was marked by clashes with his superiors '-- especially Dr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary of health for preparedness and response '-- and tension with some industry executives. Dr. Bright conceded in the complaint that those clashes came to a head after he leaked information on the dispute over the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to a reporter from Reuters."/>
						<outline text="A lawyer for Dr. Bright, Debra Katz, said he felt a ''moral obligation'' to get the word out that the administration was pressing to stockpile an unproven and potentially dangerous coronavirus treatment, which was supplied by drugmakers in India and Pakistan and had not been certified by the Food and Drug Administration."/>
						<outline text="The complaint says top Department of Health and Human Services officials, including Dr. Kadlec, who oversees the strategic national stockpile, overruled scientific experts while awarding contracts to firms represented by the consultant, John Clerici. Mr. Clerici, a founder of a Washington-based firm, Tiber Creek Partners, was instrumental, along with Dr. Kadlec, in writing the legislation that created BARDA."/>
						<outline text="''Dr. Bright was vocal about his concerns regarding the inappropriate and possibly illegal communications between Mr. Clerici, Dr. Kadlec, Mr. Shuy and Mr. Meekins,'' the complaint stated, referring to Bryan Shuy and Chris Meekins, two other department officials."/>
						<outline text="A spokeswoman for the department, Caitlin Oakley, did not address the complaints about officials there."/>
						<outline text="''Dr. Bright was transferred to N.I.H. to work on diagnostics testing '-- critical to combating Covid-19 '-- where he has been entrusted to spend upward of $1 billion to advance that effort,'' she said in an emailed statement. ''We are deeply disappointed that he has not shown up to work on behalf of the American people and lead on this critical endeavor.''"/>
						<outline text="Dr. Bright was initially offered a narrower role at the National Institutes of Health to work on a new ''Shark Tank''-style program to develop coronavirus treatments, but Ms. Katz told reporters he ''has no role'' and did not receive his last paycheck. A spokeswoman, Kendra Barkoff Lamy, later said that, at his doctor's direction, Dr. Bright ''has been on sick leave due to hypertension caused by this current situation.''"/>
						<outline text="In a statement, Mr. Clerici said he ''unequivocally'' denied any wrongdoing, adding: ''It's sad that during a pandemic, Dr. Bright and his team have chosen to distract people like Dr. Kadlec, who are critical to the response, with politically motivated allegations. The record is clear that his allegations are false and will be proven so.''"/>
						<outline text="The complaint, written by Ms. Katz and her law partner, Lisa Banks, identifies four specific instances in which Dr. Bright felt Mr. Clerici exerted undue influence. At one point, it said, Dr. Bright called for an investigation by the inspector general ''to help break up the 'cottage industry' of marketing consultants and political influence into these contracts.''"/>
						<outline text="Dr. Bright also said Mr. Clerici pushed, albeit unsuccessfully, for an extension of a contract awarded to a company run by someone who was ''friends with Jared'' and ''has Hollywood connections.'' In a brief interview, Mr. Clerici said the ''conversation never happened.''"/>
						<outline text="The document paints Dr. Bright as sounding the alarm about the emerging coronavirus threat and pressing his superiors to do more to prepare '-- including purchasing masks that would later turn out to be in short supply '-- at a time when Mr. Azar was downplaying the crisis."/>
						<outline text="On Jan. 23, he met with Mr. Azar and Dr. Kadlec to press ''for urgent access to funding, personnel and clinical specimens, including viruses,'' that would be necessary to develop treatments, the complaint said. But Mr. Azar and Dr. Kadlec ''asserted that the United States would be able to contain the virus'' through travel bans, the complaint said, adding that Dr. Bright was cut out of future department meetings related to Covid-19."/>
						<outline text="But the complaint says Dr. Bright found an ally in Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump's trade adviser, who ''shared Dr. Bright's sense of urgency, recognized his expertise and was prepared to help.'' In early February, an official from a company that makes masks connected Dr. Bright with Mr. Navarro, and the two met at the White House on Feb. 8, a Saturday, more than a month before Mr. Trump declared a national emergency."/>
						<outline text="In that meeting, the complaint said, Dr. Bright urged Mr. Navarro to have the government stop exporting high-quality N95 masks, stock up on remdesivir, an antiviral drug approved last week by the F.D.A. to treat Covid-19, and develop a ''Manhattan Project'' for a vaccine '-- an idea Mr. Trump recently adopted."/>
						<outline text="Mr. Navarro invited Dr. Bright back the following day to help him draft recommendations for the president's coronavirus task force '-- a move that angered top department officials, the complaint said."/>
						<outline text="Dr. Bright is asking the Office of Special Counsel to take steps to force the department to reinstate him as head of BARDA. In a brief statement during a conference call convened by his lawyers, he said the past few years ''have been beyond challenging.''"/>
						<outline text="''Time after time, I was pressured to ignore or dismiss expert scientific recommendations and instead to award lucrative contracts based on political connections,'' Dr. Bright said."/>
						<outline text="Dr. Bright was named to lead BARDA a day after Mr. Trump's election in November 2016, inheriting an agency full of fights with companies over contracting approvals. He proved a polarizing figure."/>
						<outline text="Bruce Gellin, the former director of the department's National Vaccine Program Office, described Dr. Bright as a ''visionary thinker'' who pushed BARDA to take risks and innovate. But some lobbyists and pharmaceutical executives say that under Dr. Bright, the disputes over contracting worsened, a situation that led to a review by an outside consulting firm to evaluate the situation."/>
						<outline text="The consultant, Mitre Corporation, issued two reports; neither is publicly available. The first concluded that some companies were badly treated by BARDA and included criticism that it lacked technical prowess and professionalism, according to two people who were told about its contents. It was later rewritten to include more flattering information about BARDA that was left out of the first report."/>
						<outline text="But the final straw for Dr. Bright came when Mr. Trump started pushing hydroxychloroquine as a possible ''game changer'' in the treatment of the virus. Dr. Bright pushed to limit access to the drug to hospitalized patients, but grew troubled when administration officials, including Dr. Kadlec, continued to press for its widespread usage, the complaint said."/>
						<outline text="When a Reuters reporter contacted him, he shared emails with the news outlet. Its story was published on April 16, and Dr. Bright was removed less than a week later."/>
						<outline text="Michael D. Shear contributed reporting."/>
						<outline text="Updated April 11, 2020"/>
						<outline text="What should I do if I feel sick?If you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others."/>
						<outline text="When will this end?This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: ''How will we know when to reopen the country?'' In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days."/>
						<outline text="How can I help?The Times Neediest Cases Fund has started a special campaign to help those who have been affected, which accepts donations here. Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30,000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal, though.)"/>
						<outline text="Should I wear a mask?The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing."/>
						<outline text="How do I get tested?If you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance '-- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance '-- you won't be able to get tested."/>
						<outline text="How does coronavirus spread?It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face."/>
						<outline text="Is there a vaccine yet?No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away."/>
						<outline text="What makes this outbreak so different?Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions '-- not just those with respiratory diseases '-- particularly hard."/>
						<outline text="What if somebody in my family gets sick?If the family member doesn't need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there's space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don't forget to wash your hands frequently."/>
						<outline text="Should I stock up on groceries?Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home."/>
						<outline text="Can I go to the park?Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea."/>
						<outline text="Should I pull my money from the markets?That's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years."/>
						<outline text="What should I do with my 401(k)?Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions '-- don't! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you're at least saving as much as you can to get that ''free money.''"/>

						<outline text="ALAMEDA, Calif. (KRON) '' An emergency order to release non-violent inmates from jail due to COVID-19, appears to have been used to release a violent sexual assault suspect, according to an East Bay city official. "/>
						<outline text="The council that wrote the order says that was not the intention. "/>
						<outline text="''When the bail motion was made we strenuously objected to it,'' Alameda County District Attorney spokesperson Teresa Drenick said."/>
						<outline text="''The attorney specifically petitioned Judge Reardon to reduce his bail,'' Livermore Mayor John Marchand said. "/>
						<outline text="There is controversy regarding the an Alameda County Superior Court Judges decision to reduce the bail, paving the way to release 61-year-old Gregory Vien from Santa Rita Jail. "/>
						<outline text="Vien was arrested back in November as a suspect in a pair of violent sexual assaults that occurred back in 1997 '-- One in Union City, the other in the town of Livermore where he is now on home confinement. "/>
						<outline text="''The gentleman was being held on $2.5 million of bail. We believe that poses a danger to the community,'' Drenick said. "/>
						<outline text="However, after Vien's attorney told the judge her client has a medical condition, the judge reduced Vien's bail down to zero. "/>
						<outline text="Livermore Mayor John Marchand believes the judge misused the California Judicial Council's emergency bail reduction order which released non-violent criminals from jail to reduce the spread of COVID-19."/>
						<outline text="''The Judicial Council has recommendations that the judge has the authority to reduce bail to zero for level felonies and misdemeanors. In my mind, multiple violent rapes does not constitute low level felonies and I don't think that he should have been release into my community,'' Marchand said. "/>
						<outline text="A representative from the California Judicial Council sent KRON4 this statement:"/>
						<outline text="''The Judicial Council's emergency $0 bail schedule applies only to those accused of misdemeanors and low-level felonies as a way to safely reduce jail populations during the pandemic. People accused of serious, violent felonies, crimes requiring sex offender registration, domestic violence or stalking, or driving under the influence are not eligible under this rule.It is also not a blanket release order'--a judge can still deny or raise bail if they find good cause that a defendant is a threat to public safety.''"/>
						<outline text="That is why Mayor Marchand penned a letter to state leaders including Governor Gavin Newsom hoping to find advocates who can help reverse this decision."/>
						<outline text="''My top priority as the Mayor of Livermore is the safety of my community,'' Marchand said."/>

						<outline text="CORONAVIRUS            To clarify the &quot;confusing&quot; messaging coming from the State, Mayor Adler plans to announce an extension to the stay-home order."/>
						<outline text="AUSTIN, Texas '-- Austin Mayor Steve Adler said the messaging from State has been &quot;confusing,&quot; after Gov. Greg Abbott partially reopened the state on Friday, May 1. The mayor is now trying to clarify some of the confusion, adding that the City will extend the stay-at-home order in Austin-Travis County. "/>
						<outline text="The stay-at-home order is set to expire on May 8, but the mayor told KVUE that city leaders have plans to extend the order."/>
						<outline text="&quot;It's kind of confusing right now with the messaging from the State, and we're going to try and clarify that this week by extending our order,&quot; Adler said."/>
						<outline text="Adler did not say how long the order will be extended or give a date on when city leaders will announce the order extension."/>
						<outline text="&quot;We are not past this,&quot; Adler said on KVUE Daybreak Monday, May 4. &quot;It's not like we have cured the virus, because we have not. It is as infectious and as deadly as it was a month ago.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Adler also encouraged people to stay at home as much as possible, with the exception of essential workers &quot;to minimize the contact as best we possibly can, or we are going to start seeing a spike, and that's the concern.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="&quot;We did a really good job of flattening the curve,&quot; Adler said, referring to how Austin hasn't hit its hospital capacity, intensive-care-unit capacity, or ventilator capacity. &quot;The concern is that can change on the dime. ... I am concerned with the number of social interactions that are happening right now. The work we did over the last four weeks will not have any impact over the next two to four weeks if we're having more and more physical interaction.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Adler also told KVUE he was worried Austin could have a second surge of the virus. People should still be wearing masks, limiting their social interaction, &quot;and staying real vigilant.&quot; "/>
						<outline text="&quot;Austin had cut down physical and social interactions and reduced them by 94%. No one was sure that we could do that but we did it as a community,&quot; he said. "/>
						<outline text="Adler emphasized that the virus is still here."/>
						<outline text="&quot;As a community, if we relax and slip below 80%, we will be on a path that overwhelms our hospitals. ... The truth is, we don't know, the governor doesn't know, no one knows what's going to happen to the amount of infections as we begin to open up businesses,&quot; the mayor told KVUE. "/>
						<outline text="Adler and his team are keeping a close watch on the numbers as businesses reopen. All of this affects the local economy, which Adler said, &quot;is hurting really badly.&quot; February saw 1,500 unemployment claims and, as of April 18, the numbers were up to 60,000 unemployment insurance claims. "/>
						<outline text="&quot;I understand the cause to reopen the economy and put people back to work,&quot; Adler added. &quot;But we know from history that the best way to ensure as a city we can come out of this is to not get overrun by the virus. The most important thing we can do for our economy right now is to contain the virus.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Adler said they are doing everything they can to help with the economic impact. City Council announced a new program to help with rental assistance and will be meeting on Thursday, May 7, to detail giving relief to nonprofits and organizations in town that need assistance."/>

						<outline text="(Reuters) - New York will work with the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to  &quot;reimagine&quot; the state's school system as part of broader reforms in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Governor Andrew Cuomo told a daily briefing on Tuesday."/>
						<outline text="Cuomo, who has emerged as a leading national voice on states' efforts to battle the crisis, said he believed people were starting to see the pandemic as a rare opportunity to make large-scale changes."/>
						<outline text="&quot;We have paid a very high price for what we are going through. But the hope is that we learn from it and that we are the better for it,&quot; Cuomo said, citing transportation, healthcare and schools as potential targets for reform."/>
						<outline text="&quot;We don't want to go through all of this and replace what was there before,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to build back better.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Cuomo said hospitals needed to be made more resilient and noted that New York City's subways would be shut for disinfection between 1 and 5 a.m. starting on Wednesday morning, likely presaging bigger changes for the nation's largest public transit system in the coming months."/>
						<outline text="He outlined plans to work with the foundation of Microsoft Corp co-founder Gates to improve New York's education system, which includes the largest public system in the country in New York City, with more than one million students."/>
						<outline text="While he did not provide specifics, Cuomo suggested a fundamental rethink of the classroom was on the table."/>
						<outline text="&quot;The old model of everybody goes and sits in a classroom and the teacher is in front of that classroom, and teaches that class, and you do that all across the city, all across the state, all these buildings, all these physical classrooms '' why with all the technology you have?&quot; Cuomo asked."/>
						<outline text="Cuomo is making plans for reopening New York, the worst-hit state by far with more than a third of the country's nearly 70,000 deaths, after a three-week decline in hospitalizations and a downtrend in the number of related deaths."/>
						<outline text="He said 230 New Yorkers died on Monday from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, a tick higher than Sunday but half the daily fatalities recorded two weeks ago. Hospitalizations and intubations continued to fall, Cuomo said."/>
						<outline text="The governor also called for a frank discussion about the trade-offs inherent in lifting restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the virus, noting that some models were revising national death counts upwards due to the decision to start re-opening in more than half of the 50 states."/>
						<outline text="&quot;The faster we reopen the lower the economic costs but the higher the human costs, because the more lives lost,&quot; Cuomo said. &quot;That is the hard truth that we are all dealing with. Let's be honest about it.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Cuomo criticized comments by U.S. President Donald Trump, who told the New York Post that giving federal funds to states financially crippled by the crisis would amount to bailing out Democratic governors who had mismanaged their states."/>
						<outline text="Calling on Trump to take a bipartisan approach, Cuomo said blocking funds to states hit hardest by the pandemic would prove to be &quot;self-defeating.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="&quot;If you starve the states, how do you expect states to fund&quot; their reopening, said Cuomo, who has estimated New York faces a $10 to $15 billion budget shortfall. &quot;If you go down this path of division you will defeat all of us.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Cuomo showed a slide of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, displaying former President Abraham Lincoln's famous line: &quot;A house divided against itself cannot stand.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="The memorial was the backdrop for Trump's virtual town hall on the pandemic broadcast by FOX News on Sunday night."/>

						<outline text="The UK and US have warned that state-backed cyber attackers are trying to steal data from universities, pharmaceuticals and research institutes involved in the coronavirus response."/>
						<outline text="Organisations trying to develop a COVID-19 vaccine are among those being targeted."/>
						<outline text="A joint advisory published on Tuesday did not name any specific country involved in the &quot;malicious cyber campaigns&quot;, but culprits are understood to include China, Russia and Iran, as well as others."/>
						<outline text="Foreign secretary warns sophisticated networks of hackers targeting UK's COVID-19 responseThe UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a branch of GCHQ, and its US counterpart, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), urged workers in healthcare and medical research to change easy-to-guess passwords."/>
						<outline text="They also advised staff in these sectors to use two-factor authentication to help fend off what the agencies called &quot;password spraying&quot; campaigns, which hit a target with multiple common passwords in the hope that one will work."/>
						<outline text="Image:          Staff have been advised to strengthen their passwordsThere is not thought to have been a successful attack on an institute in the UK, but Sky News understands attacks have had success elsewhere."/>
						<outline text="The significant rise in cyber attacks on research institutes and universities is thought to be in line with a shift in priorities of national governments in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic."/>
						<outline text="Suddenly, access to information held by a rival nation's laboratories is of top importance."/>
						<outline text="The US-UK warning said the &quot;advanced persistent threat&quot; (APT) groups carrying out the cyber attacks - typically state-backed hackers - were targeting medical research and healthcare organisations as well as local government &quot;to collect bulk personal information, intellectual property and intelligence that aligns with national priorities&quot;."/>
						<outline text=":: Listen to Divided States on Apple podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, and Spreaker"/>
						<outline text="The NCSC has made protecting the UK health sector its top priority in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, according to Paul Chichester, the director of operations."/>
						<outline text="&quot;By prioritising any requests for support from health organisations and remaining in close contact with industries involved in the coronavirus response, we can inform them of any malicious activity and take the necessary steps to help them defend against it,&quot; he said."/>
						<outline text="&quot;But we can't do this alone, and we recommend healthcare policy makers and researchers take our actionable steps to defend themselves from password spraying campaigns.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Security officials have identified targeting of national and international healthcare bodies, pharmaceutical companies, research organisations, and local government with the likely aim of gathering information related to the coronavirus outbreak, the joint US-UK statement said."/>
						<outline text="The warning followed a joint advisory from the NCSC and CISA last month about cyber criminals exploiting the coronavirus outbreak for their own personal gain."/>
						<outline text="They warned that the frequency of coronavirus-related cyber attacks will increase over the coming weeks and months."/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="The former top commander of U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan, retired four-star Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, criticized President Donald Trump's behavior and handling of the presidency, saying the commander-in-chief is dishonest and immoral."/>
						<outline text="''I don't think he tells the truth,'' McChrystal said in an exclusive interview on ''This Week'' when asked by Co-Anchor Martha Raddatz if he believes the president is a liar."/>
						<outline text="''Is Trump immoral, in your view?'' Raddatz asked."/>
						<outline text="''I think he is,'' he said."/>
						<outline text="McChrystal said he couldn't tell any of Trump's supporters &quot;that they are wrong,&quot; but added, &quot;What I would ask every American to do is ... stand in front of that mirror and say, 'What are we about? Am I really willing to throw away or ignore some of the things that people do that are -- are pretty unacceptable normally just because they accomplish certain other things that we might like?'"/>
						<outline text="&quot;If we want to be governed by someone we wouldn't do a business deal with because their -- their background is so shady, if we're willing to do that, then that's in conflict with who I think we are. And so I think it's necessary at those times to take a stand.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="McChrystal, a 34-year veteran of the U.S. Army, served as the head of the Joint Special Operations Command from 2003 to 2008 and later assumed command of all international forces in Afghanistan in June 2009. President Barack Obama relieved McChrystal of that command in June 2010 after Rolling Stone published controversial comments McChrystal made in an interview about the administration. In doing so, Obama still praised the general's &quot;deep intelligence&quot; and &quot;love of the country.&quot;"/>

McChrystal sits in a helicopter after a lengthy conference meeting with military officials at the forward operating base (FOB) Walton, outside of Kandahar, Afghanistan, Oct. 7, 2009.  Paula Bronstein/Getty Images, FILEMcChrystal, who recently published a book on leadership styles throughout history called, ''Leaders: Myth and Reality,'' criticized Trump for not embodying effective leadership."/>
						<outline text="''The military talks about would they come for you. And what that means is if you're put into a difficult military situation, would that leader sacrifice himself, put himself and others at risk to come for you? I have to believe that the people I'm working for would do that, whether we disagree on a lot of other things. I'm not convinced from the behavior that I've seen that that's the case here,'' said McChrystal."/>
						<outline text="He also cautioned anyone who might fill the vacancy left by Defense Secretary James Mattis' departure, to consider if their values sufficiently align with those of the president."/>
						<outline text="&quot;I think maybe it causes the American people to take pause and say, wait a minute, if we have someone who is as selfless and as committed as Jim Mattis resign his position, walking away from all the responsibility he feels for every service member in our forces and he does so in a public way like that, we ought to stop and say, 'OK, why did he do it?,'&quot; McChrystal said on &quot;This Week.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="''I would ask [potential candidates] to look in the mirror and ask them if they can get comfortable enough with President Trump's approach to governance, how he conducts himself with his values and with his worldview to be truly loyal to him as a commander in chief and going forward,'' McChrystal said. ''If there's too much of a disconnect then I would tell him I think it's -- it would be a bad foundation upon which to try to build a successful partnership at that job.''"/>
						<outline text="McChrystal said he would not take a job in the Trump administration if he were asked."/>

And I almost never saw people who were openly disingenuous on things.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="He also disagreed with Trump's approach to his visit to Iraq last week to address troops, saying the president was wrong to politicize a usually non-political occasion. In addition to talking extensively about domestic political issues in his speech to troops, Trump autographed troops' ''Make America Great Again'' hats. The president said in a tweet that the hats were not provided by the White House."/>

						<outline text="''If we encourage young military members to be Republicans or Democrats or anything particular, you start to create schisms in an infantry platoon,'' McChrystal told Raddatz on &quot;This Week.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="''I never knew who was a Democrat or Republican and even when we were generals, when you got in a room, you never talked about politics because it was just considered bad form,&quot; he said. &quot;I think if we allow it or encourage it, I think we are going to create something that could be a slippery slope.''"/>
						<outline text="McChrystal also disagreed with Trump's announcement to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, warning it would lead to &quot;greater instability&quot; in the Middle East."/>
						<outline text="&quot;What difference does it make -- does it really make, if those 2,000 U.S. forces leave?&quot; Raddatz asked."/>
						<outline text="''If you pull American influence out, you're likely to have greater instability and of course it'll be much more difficult for the United States to try to push events in any direction. There is an argument that says we just pull up our stuff, go home, let the region run itself. That has not done well for the last 50 or 60 years,'' McChrystal said."/>
						<outline text="In announcing the withdrawal from Syria earlier this month, Trump touted victory over the Islamic State, or ISIS, there, declaring,  ''We have defeated ISIS in Syria.''"/>
						<outline text="McChrystal disagreed, citing the continued threat of ISIS' ideology."/>
						<outline text="''I don't believe ISIS is defeated,'' McChrystal said. ''I think ISIS is as much an idea as it is a number of ISIS fighters. There's a lot of intelligence that says there are actually more ISIS fighters around the world now than there were a couple of years ago.''"/>

Zachery C. Laning/U.S. Marine Corps, FILEABC News has also reported that Trump plans to reduce U.S. forces in Afghanistan by half, about 7,000 troops. In a statement to Bloomberg Friday, Garrett Marquis, a spokesperson for the National Security Council said Trump &quot;has not made a determination to&quot; to withdraw troops from Afghanistan or &quot;directed the Department of Defense to begin the process of withdrawing&quot; troops. Marquis did not respond when ABC News requested further comment."/>
						<outline text="&quot;Do you see that as a problem?&quot; Raddatz asked McChrystal."/>
						<outline text="''I think the great mistake in the president's leaked guidance is that just when we were starting to sit down with the Taliban, just we were starting to begin negotiations, he basically traded away the biggest leverage point we have. If you tell the Taliban that we are absolutely leaving on a date ... their incentives to try to cut a deal dropped dramatically,'' McChrystal said."/>
						<outline text="McChrystal added that the decision could have a lasting impact on the trust in the alliance between the United States and the democratically-elected Afghan government it supports."/>
						<outline text="''Of course I was worried about the confidence of the Afghan people because at the end of the day, that's what determines who wins in Afghanistan,'' McChrystal said. ''And I think we probably rocked them -- we rocked them in their belief that we are allies that can be counted on.''"/>

						<outline text="''Concast'' should open up a long overdue Florida Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough. I know him and Crazy Mika well, used them beautifully in the last Election, dumped them nicely, and will state on the record that he is ''nuts''. Besides, bad ratings! #OPENJOECOLDCASE"/>
						<outline text="'-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 4, 2020"/>
						<outline text="Joe Scarborough responded by saying he understood that Trump didn't want to hear about the impending second wave of the pandemic."/>
						<outline text="&quot;Obviously, Donald, you didn't want to hear that again. I know I've been saying it a lot. You actually tweeted something extraordinarily cruel. I know you meant to be extraordinarily cruel to me by attacking me, by bringing up a conspiracy theory that has lived in the gutters of the internet for some time now."/>
						<outline text="&quot;But just like the Seth Rich conspiracy murder that was pushed by your allies, you don't understand the pain you cause, you cause to families who have already lost a loved one. Not me. Not my children. Not anybody that knows me or -- they know the truth. You, once again, drag a family through this and make them relive it again, just like Seth Rich's parents. As if losing a loved one the first time isn't enough.&quot; (An autopsy showed a former staffer collapsed due to an undiagnosed heart condition and suffered a fatal blow to the head as she fell.)"/>
						<outline text="&quot;But this weekend, my God, you were supposed to have a working weekend. You got it wrong again. You said 50,000, 60,000. Now you said 100,000 deaths. What did you do during your working weekend?&quot;"/>
						<outline text="He listed all the people Trump attacked this weekend, including former president George W. Bush."/>
						<outline text="&quot;You attacked George W. Bush for simply sending out a unifying message, to give Americans hope. He said positive things about Americans. He said positive things about health care workers. He said positive things about this country. He said, 'We choose to rise.' Even that offended you.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="He said Trump needed a break."/>
						<outline text="&quot;Mr. President, I ask that you get checked out. I ask that you take a rest. I ask that you take care of yourself. Maybe let Mike Pence run things for the next week. You're not well. Let Mike Pence work with Dr. Fauci, work with Dr. Birx,&quot; he said. He said it would be best for the country, and for the Republican party."/>
						<outline text="He repeated his advice."/>
						<outline text="&quot;Mr. President, you're getting worse every day. You need to take a rest. You need to let Mike Pence actually run things for the next couple of weeks. Come back when you're feeling a little better and when you can really actually focus on your job. You just can't do that right now."/>
						<outline text="&quot;Americans are dying every day because of it.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Brilliant. Trump's blood pressure must be in the red zone right now."/>

						<outline text="&quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; by Maya Angelou, &quot;Catch-22&quot; by Joseph Heller, &quot;The Things They Carried&quot; by Tim O'Brien, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald and &quot;Invisible Man&quot; by Ralph Ellison were all taken off an approved list of works that teachers in the Mat-Su Borough School District may use for instruction."/>
						<outline text="The school board voted 5-2 on Wednesday to yank the works out of teachers' hands starting this fall. The removed books contain content that could potentially harm students, school board Vice President Jim Hart told NBC News on Tuesday."/>
						<outline text="&quot;If I were to read these in a corporate environment, in an office environment, I would be dragged into EO,&quot; an equal opportunity complaint proceeding, Hart said. &quot;The question is why this is acceptable in one environment and not another.&quot;"/>

						<outline text="&quot;Caged Bird&quot; was derided for &quot;anti-white' messaging,&quot; &quot;Gatsby&quot; and &quot;Things&quot; are loaded with &quot;sexual references,&quot; &quot;Invisible Man&quot; has bad language and &quot;Catch-22&quot; includes violence, according to the school district."/>
						<outline text="Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings."/>
						<outline text="Dianne K. Shibe, president of the Mat-Su Education Association teachers union, said parents and her members were stunned by the board action."/>
						<outline text="Even though the school board had listed an agenda item to discuss &quot;controversial book descriptions,&quot; Shibe said, no one believed those works were under serious threat."/>
						<outline text="&quot;Most of the community didn't respond, because these books had been used forever,&quot; Shibe told NBC News. &quot;Now in retrospect, it's like, 'duh.' I could have seen this coming.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Shibe said her union would push board members to reconsider their action."/>
						<outline text="&quot;This is not set in stone,&quot; she said. &quot;The union is all about educating students, and this flies in the face of educating students.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Mary Ann Cockle, owner of Fireside Books in Palmer, about a mile from district headquarters, said her store ran out of copies of the books within hours of the board's action."/>
						<outline text="&quot;People who had read the books years ago are buying them to read again and to give away,&quot; Cockle said Tuesday. &quot;Our biggest outpouring of support are people buying the books and donating them or leaving them to us to distribute for free.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="A new shipment of &quot;Caged&quot; and &quot;Invisible Man&quot; arrived at Fireside on Tuesday, and Cockle expects them all to be gone by Wednesday."/>
						<outline text="&quot;I don't think they realized they were treading on censorship, and people are completely opposed to censorship,&quot; she said."/>
						<outline text="Hart insisted that the books are not &quot;banned&quot; and said they all remain in district libraries."/>
						<outline text="Even though students are still free to read the books on their own, Hart said, it would be unfair to ask teachers to have to navigate their pupils through the complicated subject matter."/>
						<outline text="&quot;These are teachers, not counselors,&quot; Hart said."/>
						<outline text="Several books that were not removed from classrooms also came under harsh scrutiny."/>
						<outline text="&quot;The Jungle&quot; and &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; could be interpreted as advocating for socialism, while &quot;A Street in Bronzeville&quot; was called into question for showing too much &quot;realism&quot; in describing racism against African Americans, according to a district memo."/>

						<outline text="Skip to contentDemonstrators stormed state capitol to protest governor's tyrannical lockdown measuresDemocrat Governor of Michigan Gretchen Whitmer went on CNN to complain about the anti-lockdown protesters unhappy with her illogical and tyrannical coronavirus lockdown measures, comparing them to neo-Nazis and racists."/>
						<outline text="With the help of CNN's liberal activist host Jake Tapper on Sunday, Whitmer portrayed the armed protesters who stormed Michigan's capitol to express their disapproval of her many new lockdown policies as a nothing but a group of angry racists."/>
						<outline text="Tapper first asked Whitmer if the Michigan protesters were ''in the same vein as the Charlottesville Neo-Nazis'' given President Trump defended them on Twitter."/>
						<outline text="''Some of the outrageousness of what happened at our capitol this week, um, you know, depicted some of the worst racism and awful parts of our history in this country,'' Whiter replied."/>
						<outline text="Whitmer then pointed to some protesters with swastikas on their signs as evidence of Nazi intentions, seemingly unaware that the swastikas were used to depict Whitmer's authoritarian policies."/>
						<outline text="''The Confederate flags and nooses, the swastikas, the behavior that you've seen in all the clips is not representative of who we are in Michigan,'' she continued. ''And the fact of the matter is, I mean, we're in a global pandemic. This isn't something we just negotiate ourselves out of as a political matter.''"/>
						<outline text="Is this protester, a black man who explained his desire to go to work again and rejection of government ''handouts'', one of the Nazis Whitmer is referring to?"/>
						<outline text="''Just allow me to work, as a man of color. I don't want any handouts,'' he said. ''Just giving me free stuff, it takes away my dignity'...why should I depend on other people to take care of me?''"/>
