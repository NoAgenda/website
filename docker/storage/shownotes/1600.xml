						<outline text="Market Update:"/>
						<outline text="We are seeing increased volatility in the stock market, including medical device stocks, due to elevated investor concerns about the impact of GLP-1 weight loss drugs (e.g., Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro) on various medical device end-markets, including ortho / spine."/>
						<outline text="-This past week, Novo Nordisk (Ozempic) announced a statistically significant reduction in chronic kidney disease for patients in its clinical trial. As a result, certain companies in the dialysis space experienced a ~20% decline in stock prices. Other recent clinical trials by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly highlighting improvement in cardiovascular disease, stroke, and Type 2 diabetes had similar impacts on companies treating those end-markets."/>
						<outline text="-Investors are struggling to understand the potential impact on demand for procedures that treat conditions that may be linked to obesity at a time when they are already concerned about economic uncertainty, including high interest rates in the US, potential recession risks in 2024, and geopolitical risks."/>
						<outline text="-Investors dislike uncertainty, and thus are reducing their exposure to medical device companies. The impact has been more pronounced for unprofitable companies. To provide some context, companies comparable to us (e,g., Orthopediatrics, Paragon 28, Nevro, Outset Medical, Silk Road, Treace Medical), are currently trading at or near all-time lows, breaching floors seen at the peak of COVID in 2020."/>
						<outline text="Our Performance:"/>
						<outline text="-While the recent market turbulence has affected our stock price, recognize that we've had a very strong year thus far due to your focused execution."/>
						<outline text="-Despite the market's reaction, we've maintained positive stock price performance year-to-date. Given our strong performance and fiscal discipline, I believe we are well positioned to benefit from the eventual stabilization of the stock market. We will need to be patient as market disruptions like this often take some time to resolve."/>
						<outline text="Our Resilience:"/>
						<outline text="While the market's response to increased use of GLP-1 drugs for weight control may be distracting and somewhat irrational, I want to emphasize that we are on the right track. We continue to see strong underlying demand for our products. Our exceptional talent, YOU!, and steadfast dedication to our mission have been instrumental to our success, and I have every confidence that this will be something that continues to set us apart. Anshul and I will educate analysts and investors on this topic during our upcoming Q3 earnings announcement."/>

				<outline text="ESG Scam" created="Thu, 19 Oct 2023 15:44:55 GMT">
					<outline text="&lt;i&gt;BOTG ESG and flare gas&lt;/i&gt;">
						<outline text="I wanted to follow up on your ESG/oil and gas segment at the beginning of last episode."/>
						<outline text="I work in the oilfield in North Dakota, and one of the biggest ESG scams they’re running is in relation to what we call “flaring.” Flaring is the process of burning off excess natural gas. In the past, oil and gas producers flared their excess gas on an almost continuous basis. Now, with the onset of ESG, they are required to limit how many cubic feet of gas they flare. Because of climate change, you see."/>
						<outline text="Each company is given a specific “flare allotment,” that they are then fined for exceeding."/>
						<outline text="Here’s the scam."/>
						<outline text="Because of this allotment, oil and gas producers are forced to sell all the gas they produce to a midstream gas company, who then sells it to their customers downstream. One of the largest producers in the Bakken oil patch is Marathon Oil. Of course, Blackrock is an investor. One of the largest midstream gas companies in the Bakken is called Oneok. Of course, Blackrock is also an investor in this company. So Blackrock is making money on the sale of gas to the midstream company, and the sale of that same gas to the downstream customer."/>
						<outline text="Here’s the real kicker. A significant amount of the gas produced in North Dakota is “sour gas.” Meaning, it has hydrogen sulfide in it, which is extremely poisonous. Midstream gas companies won’t buy sour gas, which puts the oil and gas producer in the position of either flaring and paying a fine, or buying hydrogen sulfide “scavenging” chemical to turn their sour gas sweet."/>
						<outline text="Oilfield chemical companies sell hydrogen sulfide scavenger by the billions of gallons, and I bet if one was to dig around, many of those chemical companies would be in Blackrock’s portfolio as well."/>
						<outline text="It’s all a scam."/>
						<outline text="Hope you’re well, sir!"/>

						<outline text="About 10 months ago, I figured out that I wanted to start hormone replacement therapy and in that way medically transition. There were many reasons for this decision, but one of them was the realization that growing up Israeli and trans in Jerusalem while being expected to become a Zionist man left an aftermath in my body. I needed help to heal, and sensed that growing a rounder, more tender body would help me connect with the justice-loving feminine child inside of me, and that having such a body would help me grow from that soft place."/>

						<outline text="I just got back from a week long mission trip in the Dominican Republic and I have some information I thought might be interesting to you. First I had a conversation with a pastor at a local church in the Dominican Republic and he informed me that the LGBT agenda has infected his country. He laid the blame for that on organizations from the United States. Also, I was told by multiple people that the hospitals in the Dominican Republic are currently overwhelmed. Pastor Michàel told me that the people of the Dominican Republic have been plagued by health issues such as diabetes, heart attacks, blood pressure, and other similar ailments. When I asked him why it had become such a problem he told me it all started after the Covid “vaccine” was pushed on his people. He said he was convinced that the “vaccine” was the culprit. They have also been overwhelmed with cases of Dengue. I don’t know how Dengue would be related but I thought it was all very interesting/concerning and I wanted to pass the information along to you.

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="Washington       CNN          '-- "/>
						<outline text="President Joe Biden has a favorite story about his long relationship with Israel. For decades, he has been publicly recounting his 1973 meeting with then-Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir '' which he described in 2015 as ''one of the most consequential meetings I've ever had in my life.''"/>
						<outline text="But parts of the version of the story Biden told on Wednesday, at a White House menorah lighting for the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, were not accurate."/>
						<outline text="Most of the details of Biden's Wednesday account were the same or very similar to the details in his previous accounts. Biden said that Meir kept referring to a bunch of maps, that future Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was present, that Meir offered to take a photo with Biden, and that Meir painted a dark picture of Israel's security situation but then assured him that Israel had a ''secret weapon'' in its conflicts with its neighbors: ''We have no place else to go.''"/>
						<outline text="But two elements of Biden's Wednesday version were different than usual, and both of these changes were incorrect. One of the falsehoods was obviously an accidental slip; the other was more substantial."/>
						<outline text="Biden began on Wednesday as follows: ''And during the Six-Day War, I had an opportunity to '' she invited me to come over because I was going to be the liaison between she and the Egyptians about the Suez, and so on and so forth.'' Later in the story, he suggested that Meir had referred to him during the meeting as ''Mr. Ambassador.''"/>
						<outline text="Facts First: Biden misspoke about when his meeting with Meir occurred. The meeting took place about five weeks before the Yom Kippur War in 1973, not during the Six-Day War in 1967. More significantly, Biden inflated his importance to Israel at the time. There is no evidence that Meir had any intention of using him as any sort of ''liaison'' between Israel and Egypt."/>
						<outline text="At the time of the Six-Day War in 1967, Biden was still a law student and Meir was not yet prime minister."/>
						<outline text="Biden's ''liaison'' claim is vague, but experts on the Yom Kippur War say it is also clearly inaccurate. While Biden did visit Egypt in 1973 just before he visited Israel, and told Meir what Egyptian officials had told him, there is zero indication that Meir wanted to use a 30-year-old American who had had never previously been to Israel and who had been a senator for only nine months as an intermediary in a complicated and critical conflict. In fact, an Israeli government official's written summary of the meeting said Biden had seemed inexperienced and that Meir had vehemently rejected his proposal for Israel to unilaterally withdraw from certain territory as a step toward peace."/>
						<outline text="A White House official suggested to CNN on Thursday that Biden's assertion that ''she invited me to come over because I was going to be the liaison between she and the Egyptians about the Suez'' was simply a reference to the fact that he had met with both Egyptian and Israeli officials on the 1973 trip to discuss relations between their countries."/>
						<outline text="But Biden's words, which were called false by the Republican National Committee on Thursday, conveyed the impression that Meir sought to use him in an important diplomatic role. Experts say that is indeed baseless."/>
						<outline text="''There is no reason to believe that Golda, who as Biden himself described, did not trust a diplomatic process, would voluntarily ask an inexperienced young senator to be her liaison for such a mission,'' said Uri Bar-Joseph, a Haifa University political science professor and the author of a book on what was happening in the Israeli government prior to the Yom Kippur War."/>
						<outline text="Bar-Joseph said in an email that there is ''nothing'' in the Israeli summary of the August 31, 1973, meeting to even ''hint'' that Meir had invited Biden to be a liaison. And Asaf Siniver, a University of Birmingham associate professor in international security and the editor of a book on the Yom Kippur War, said in an email, ''As far as I know there is no basis to the claim that he was 'going to be the liaison' between the sides.''"/>
						<outline text="In Biden's Wednesday telling of the story, the only one we could find in which he spoke of a ''liaison'' role, he said of Meir: ''She looked at me and she said, 'Mr. Ambassador, would you like a photograph?''' In some other tellings of the story, though, Biden has said that Meir addressed him just before or during the photo opportunity as ''son'' or as ''senator,'' not as ''Mr. Ambassador.''"/>
						<outline text="Meir died in 1978, and it's impossible to know precisely what was said between her and Biden 48 years ago. But the Israeli summary of the 100-minute meeting, an internal memo written by a government official at the time, provides useful information."/>
						<outline text="The summary, which was discussed in the Israeli media in 2020 and is available online in Israel's state archives, said Biden acknowledged he was not an expert on Egypt, said Biden was greeted warmly on his trip to Egypt but had met with only second-tier officials, and said Meir made extended remarks in which she argued against Biden's proposal for Israel to pursue peace by withdrawing from certain territory he didn't think had strategic value. (The summary didn't identify the territory Biden was talking about but said it wasn't the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights or Sharm el-Sheikh.)"/>
						<outline text="The Israeli official who wrote the summary, Gideon Yarden, ended by offering his personal assessment of Biden. He wrote that Biden was full of admiration and appreciation toward Meir, and kept saying he had come to learn, ''but on the other hand'' spoke in a manner that reflected ''his age and diplomatic 'experience.''' Yarden put the word ''experience'' in quotation marks, conveying sarcasm."/>
						<outline text="Another part of the Israeli account of the meeting differs from an account Biden offered in 2015."/>
						<outline text="In a speech marking Israeli Independence Day, Biden, then vice president, said he had told Meir and Rabin during the meeting that ''I thought that they (Egypt) were getting ready to attack again.'' He added: ''And everyone including my military and Israeli military thought I was crazy.''"/>
						<outline text="The Israeli summary does not note any such comment from Biden. Rather, the summary reported that Biden had conveyed that, of all the officials he had met in Egypt, none of them denied Israeli's absolute military superiority, and that the officials had argued it would be impossible for Egypt to go to war now against Israel."/>
						<outline text="In reality, Egypt and Syria ended up attacking Israel in early October 1973. The attack also caught Israel by surprise."/>

					<outline text="The Westminster Declaration">

						<outline text="Archived Version" type="link" url="http://adam.curry.com/art/1697691014_fk5gy6YF.html"/>
						<outline text="Thu, 19 Oct 2023 04:50"/>
						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="The Westminster Declaration We write as journalists, artists, authors, activists, technologists, and academics to warn of increasing international censorship that threatens to erode centuries-old democratic norms."/>
						<outline text="Coming from the left, right, and centre, we are united by our commitment to universal human rights and freedom of speech, and we are all deeply concerned about attempts to label protected speech as 'misinformation,' 'disinformation,' and other ill-defined terms."/>
						<outline text="This abuse of these terms has resulted in the censorship of ordinary people, journalists, and dissidents in countries all over the world."/>
						<outline text="Such interference with the right to free speech suppresses valid discussion about matters of urgent public interest, and undermines the foundational principles of representative democracy."/>
						<outline text="Across the globe, government actors, social media companies, universities, and NGOs are increasingly working to monitor citizens and rob them of their voices. These large-scale coordinated efforts are sometimes referred to as the  'Censorship-Industrial Complex.'"/>
						<outline text="This complex often operates through direct government policies. Authorities in India [1]  and Turkey [2]  have seized the power to remove political content from social media. The legislature in Germany [3]  and the Supreme Court in Brazil[4] are criminalising political speech. In other countries, measures such as Ireland's 'Hate Speech' Bill [5] , Scotland's Hate Crime Act[6], the UK's Online Safety Bill[7], and Australia's 'Misinformation' Bill[8] threaten to severely restrict expression and create a chilling effect."/>
						<outline text="But the Censorship Industrial Complex operates through more subtle methods. These include visibility filtering, labelling, and manipulation of search engine results. Through deplatforming and flagging, social media censors have already silenced lawful opinions on topics of national and geopolitical importance. They have done so with the full support of 'disinformation experts' and 'fact-checkers' in the mainstream media, who have abandoned the journalistic values of debate and intellectual inquiry."/>
						<outline text="As the Twitter Files revealed, tech companies often perform censorial 'content moderation' in coordination with government agencies and civil society. Soon, the European Union's Digital Services Act will formalise this relationship by giving platform data to 'vetted researchers' from NGOs and academia, relegating our speech rights to the discretion of these unelected and unaccountable entities."/>
						<outline text="Some politicians and NGOs[9] are even aiming to target end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram.[10] If end-to-end encryption is broken, we will have no remaining avenues for authentic private conversations in the digital sphere."/>
						<outline text="Although foreign disinformation between states is a real issue, agencies designed to combat these threats, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the United States, are increasingly being turned inward against the public. Under the guise of preventing harm and protecting truth, speech is being treated as a permitted activity rather than an inalienable right."/>
						<outline text="We recognize that words can sometimes cause offence, but we reject the idea that hurt feelings and discomfort, even if acute, are grounds for censorship. Open discourse is the central pillar of a free society, and is essential for holding governments accountable, empowering vulnerable groups, and reducing the risk of tyranny."/>
						<outline text="Speech protections are not just for views we agree with; we must strenuously protect speech for the views that we most strongly oppose. Only in the public square can these views be heard and properly challenged."/>
						<outline text="What's more, time and time again, unpopular opinions and ideas have eventually become conventional wisdom. By labelling certain political or scientific positions as 'misinformation' or 'malinformation,' our societies risk getting stuck in false paradigms that will rob humanity of hard-earned knowledge and obliterate the possibility of gaining new knowledge. Free speech is our best defence against disinformation."/>
						<outline text="The attack on speech is not just about distorted rules and regulations '' it is a crisis of humanity itself. Every equality and justice campaign in history has relied on an open forum to voice dissent. In countless examples, including the abolition of slavery and the civil rights movement, social progress has depended on freedom of expression."/>
						<outline text="We do not want our children to grow up in a world where they live in fear of speaking their minds. We want them to grow up in a world where their ideas can be expressed, explored and debated openly '' a world that the founders of our democracies envisioned when they enshrined free speech into our laws and constitutions."/>
						<outline text="The US First Amendment is a strong example of how the right to freedom of speech, of the press, and of conscience can be firmly protected under the law. One need not agree with the U.S. on every issue to acknowledge that this is a vital 'first liberty' from which all other liberties follow. It is only through free speech that we can denounce violations of our rights and fight for new freedoms."/>
						<outline text="There also exists a clear and robust international protection for free speech. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)[11] was drafted in 1948 in response to atrocities committed during World War II. Article 19 of the UDHR states, 'Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.' While there may be a need for governments to regulate some aspects of social media, such as age limits, these regulations should never infringe on the human right to freedom of expression. "/>
						<outline text="As is made clear by Article 19, the corollary of the right to free speech is the right to information. In a democracy, no one has a monopoly over what is considered to be true. Rather, truth must be discovered through dialogue and debate '' and we cannot discover truth without allowing for the possibility of error. "/>
						<outline text="Censorship in the name of 'preserving democracy' inverts what should be a bottom-up system of representation into a top-down system of ideological control. This censorship is ultimately counter-productive: it sows mistrust, encourages radicalization, and de-legitimizes the democratic process. "/>
						<outline text="In the course of human history, attacks on free speech have been a precursor to attacks on all other liberties. Regimes that eroded free speech have always inevitably weakened and damaged other core democratic structures. In the same fashion, the elites that push for censorship today are also undermining democracy. What has changed though, is the broad scale and technological tools through which censorship can be enacted. "/>
						<outline text="We believe that free speech is essential for ensuring our safety from state abuses of power '' abuses that have historically posed a far greater threat than the words of lone individuals or even organised groups. For the sake of human welfare and flourishing, we make the following 3 calls to action."/>
						<outline text="We call on governments and international organisations to fulfill their responsibilities to the people and to uphold Article 19 of the UDHR. "/>
						<outline text="We call on tech corporations to undertake to protect the digital public square as defined in Article 19 of the UDHR and refrain from politically motivated censorship, the censorship of dissenting voices, and censorship of political opinion."/>
						<outline text="And finally, we call on the general public to join us in the fight to preserve the people's democratic rights. Legislative changes are not enough. We must also build an atmosphere of free speech from the ground up by rejecting the climate of intolerance that encourages self-censorship and that creates unnecessary personal strife for many. Instead of fear and dogmatism, we must embrace inquiry and debate."/>
						<outline text="We stand for your right to ask questions. Heated arguments, even those that may cause distress, are far better than no arguments at all. "/>
						<outline text="Censorship robs us of the richness of life itself. Free speech is the foundation for creating a life of meaning and a thriving humanity - through art, poetry, drama, story, philosophy, song, and more. "/>
						<outline text="This declaration was the result of an initial meeting of free speech champions from around the world who met in Westminster, London, at the end of June 2023. As signatories of this statement, we have fundamental political and ideological disagreements. However, it is only by coming together that we will defeat the encroaching forces of censorship so that we can maintain our ability to openly debate and challenge one another. It is in the spirit of difference and debate that we sign the Westminster Declaration."/>

(NYSE:PFE) today announced that it has amended its supply agreement with the U.S. government for Paxlovid, the first oral antiviral pill approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is updating its Full-Year 2023 Guidance."/>
						<outline text="Paxlovid Amended Agreement with U.S. Government Facilitates Commercialization"/>
						<outline text="At the end of 2023, Pfizer will accept a non-cash return of any remaining Emergency Use Authorized (EUA)-labeled U.S. government inventory, estimated to be 7.9 million treatment courses, and in the fourth quarter, will reverse the associated revenues currently estimated to be approximately $4.2 billion."/>
						<outline text="The commercial transition will begin in November 2023, as the U.S. government begins to discontinue the distribution of EUA-labeled Paxlovid. Pfizer will ensure commercial readiness by providing NDA-labeled commercial supply to all channels by the end of 2023, however, EUA-labeled Paxlovid will remain available free-of-charge to all eligible patients until the end of the year, and therefore Pfizer expects only minimal uptake of NDA-labeled commercial product before January 1, 2024."/>
						<outline text="Any remaining EUA-labeled treatment courses previously purchased by the U.S. government will be converted to a volume-based credit. This credit will support continued access to Paxlovid through a patient assistance program (PAP) operated by Pfizer on behalf of the U.S. government. As part of the PAP, all federally insured patients (Medicare and Medicaid) and the uninsured will receive Paxlovid, free of charge, through 2024. Beginning in 2024, Pfizer will sell Paxlovid to privately insured patients (commercial) with prices to be negotiated with payers and offer a copay program through 2028. The PAP will continue to provide access to Paxlovid to eligible uninsured and underinsured patients through that same period."/>
						<outline text="Additionally, Pfizer will manage and supply 1.0 million treatment course U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to enable future pandemic preparedness and refresh stock prior to expiry through 2028."/>
						<outline text="Pfizer will recognize revenues as product is delivered beginning in 2024."/>
						<outline text="Updates Outlook for COVID-19 Products"/>
						<outline text="Pfizer also announced additional clarity on its full-year 2023 outlook for its COVID products '' Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Clarity on the underlying vaccination and treatment rates will be observed by year end and will set a reliable base for the prediction of future product utilization."/>
						<outline text="As previously announced, the European Union (EU) contract for Comirnaty supply was renegotiated with amended purchasing obligations through 2026. The U.S. market for Comirnaty transitioned to commercially available product in September 2023. Due to the recent commencement of the fall vaccination period, the outlook for year-end vaccination rates and market shares requires more time for more determinable estimates."/>
						<outline text="As previously announced, Paxlovid also received full NDA approval from the FDA earlier this year. The global utilization rates for Paxlovid are currently trending slightly above last year's utilization but lower than our original expectations."/>
						<outline text="Launches Cost Realignment Program"/>
						<outline text="In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Pfizer announced that the company has launched a multi-year, enterprise-wide cost realignment program that will realign its costs with its longer-term revenue expectations. The program is expected to deliver targeted savings of at least $3.5 billion, of which $1.0 billion is expected to be realized in 2023 and an additional $2.5 billion is expected to be realized in 2024. The one-time costs to achieve the savings associated with the new cost realignment program are expected to be approximately $3.0 billion, of which the majority is expected to be cash. These costs will primarily include severance and implementation costs. Pfizer will continue to refine the estimated targeted savings and their associated costs over the remainder of the year and will incorporate them into its full-year guidance for 2024."/>
						<outline text="Updates Full-Year 2023 Revenue and Adjusted(2) Diluted EPS Guidance(1) Ranges"/>
						<outline text="Pfizer also announced that it now anticipates full-year 2023 revenues to be in the range of $58.0 to $61.0 billion, versus its previous guidance range of $67.0 to $70.0 billion solely due to its COVID products. Full-year 2023 revenues for Paxlovid and Comirnaty are expected to be approximately $12.5 billion, a decline of $9.0 billion versus original expectations. The company is reducing its full-year 2023 revenue expectations for Paxlovid by approximately $7.0 billion which includes a non-cash $4.2 billion revenue reversal for the return of the 7.9 million treatment courses of EUA-labeled U.S. government inventory, as well as the delayed commercialization to January 2024 versus our previous expectation of commercialization in the second half of 2023. The company is also reducing its full-year 2023 revenue expectations for Comirnaty by approximately $2.0 billion due to lower-than-expected vaccination rates."/>
						<outline text="Pfizer's non-COVID products remain on track to achieve an expected 6% to 8% operational revenue growth year over year in 2023."/>
						<outline text="Due to lower-than-expected utilization for our COVID products, Pfizer recorded a non-cash charge of $5.5 billion to Cost of Goods Sold in the third quarter of 2023 primarily related to inventory write-offs for Paxlovid of $4.6 billion and to a lesser extent for inventory write-offs and other charges for Comirnaty of $0.9 billion."/>
						<outline text="The company expects to deliver approximately $1.0 billion in savings in 2023 through its cost realignment program."/>
						<outline text="Revised guidance also reflects anticipated improvement in our Effective Tax Rate on Adjusted(2) Income for 2023 from approximately 15% in our original guidance to approximately 12%."/>
						<outline text="Due to the aforementioned items, the company now expects full-year 2023 Adjusted(2) diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.65 versus its original guidance range of $3.25 to $3.45."/>

						<outline text="(b) All other adjustments include approximately $4.8 billion reduction in COVID product revenue due to the delayed commercialization of Paxlovid to January 2024 versus our previous expectation of commercialization in second half of 2023 as well as lower-than-expected vaccination rates for Comirnaty partially offset by $1.0 billion in anticipated savings from the cost realignment program."/>

						<outline text="''At the same time, this agreement with the U.S. government makes it easier for patients to access Paxlovid; enables the United States to have a robust stockpile for future use; and provides Pfizer with greater clarity regarding the transition to a commercial market for this important treatment, which has helped remove some of the uncertainty around our business expectations for our COVID products. We expect additional clarification on global vaccination and treatment rates by the end of the year, which we expect will be a good predictor of utilization in future years."/>
						<outline text="''We remain proud that our scientific breakthroughs played a significant role in getting the global health crisis under control. Over the past several years, we have continued to ensure supply readiness for our COVID products, and as we gain additional clarity around vaccination and treatment rates for COVID, we will be better able to estimate the appropriate level of supply to meet demand and continue to address any ongoing public health needs. As a result, we continue to expect our COVID-related revenues to contribute to our business in future periods, helping us to further invest in activities that drive Pfizer's long-term growth potential.''"/>

						<outline text="Pfizer COVID-19 Treatment Transition"/>
						<outline text="Albert Bourla announces an important agreement with the U.S. government that will make it easier for patients to access Pfizer's oral antiviral treatment for COVID-19. This will help ensure that the United States will have a robust stockpile for future use and helps provide more clarity on the commercial market for COVID related products. This is the next logical step in Pfizer's unrelenting effort to help ensure every eligible patient continues to have access to this potentially life-saving medicine."/>

						<outline text="Limitations of Use"/>
						<outline text="PAXLOVID is not approved for use as pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19."/>
						<outline text="U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization"/>
						<outline text="The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the emergency use of PAXLOVID for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death."/>

The emergency use of PAXLOVID is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner."/>
						<outline text="IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION"/>
						<outline text="WARNING: SIGNIFICANT DRUG INTERACTIONS WITH PAXLOVID"/>
						<outline text="PAXLOVID includes ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, which may lead to greater exposure of certain concomitant medications, resulting in potentially severe, life-threatening, or fatal eventsPrior to prescribing PAXLOVID: 1) Review all medications taken by the patient to assess potential drug-drug interactions with a strong CYP3A inhibitor like PAXLOVID and 2) Determine if concomitant medications require a dose adjustment, interruption, and/or additional monitoringConsider the benefit of PAXLOVID treatment in reducing hospitalization and death, and whether the risk of potential drug-drug interactions for an individual patient can be appropriately managedPAXLOVID is contraindicated in patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions (eg, toxic epidermal necrolysis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to its active ingredients (nirmatrelvir or ritonavir) or any other components of the product. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue PAXLOVID and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care."/>
						<outline text="PAXLOVID is contraindicated with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions and drugs that are strong CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced nirmatrelvir or ritonavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance. There are certain other drugs for which concomitant use with PAXLOVID should be avoided and/or dose adjustment, interruption, or therapeutic monitoring is recommended. Drugs listed here are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all drugs that may be contraindicated with PAXLOVID. The healthcare provider should consult other appropriate resources such as the prescribing information for the interacting drug for comprehensive information on dosing or monitoring with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor like PAXLOVID."/>
						<outline text="Drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions:"/>
						<outline text="Alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist: alfuzosinAntianginal: ranolazineAntiarrhythmic: amiodarone, dronedarone, flecainide, propafenone, quinidineAnti-gout: colchicine (in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment)Antipsychotics: lurasidone, pimozideBenign prostatic hyperplasia agents: silodosinCardiovascular agents: eplerenone, ivabradineErgot derivatives: dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergonovineHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: lovastatin, simvastatin (these drugs can be temporarily discontinued to allow PAXLOVID use)Immunosuppressants: voclosporinMicrosomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor: lomitapideMigraine medications: eletriptan, ubrogepantMineralocorticoid receptor antagonists: finerenoneOpioid antagonists: naloxegolPDE5 inhibitor: sildenafil (Revatio®) when used for pulmonary arterial hypertensionSedative/hypnotics: triazolam, oral midazolamSerotonin receptor 1A agonist/serotonin receptor 2A antagonist: flibanserinVasopressin receptor antagonists: tolvaptanDrugs that are strong CYP3A inducers: PAXLOVID cannot be started immediately after discontinuation of any of the following medications due to the delayed offset of the recently discontinued CYP3A inducer:"/>

Medications that induce CYP3A may decrease concentrations of PAXLOVID. These interactions may lead to:"/>
						<outline text="Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medicationsLoss of therapeutic effect of PAXLOVID and possible development of viral resistanceSevere, life-threatening, and/or fatal adverse reactions due to drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with PAXLOVID. The most commonly reported concomitant medications resulting in serious adverse reactions were calcineurin inhibitors (eg, tacrolimus, cyclosporine), followed by calcium channel blockers."/>
						<outline text="Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic transaminase elevations, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering PAXLOVID to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, or hepatitis. Because nirmatrelvir is coadministered with ritonavir, there may be a risk ofHIV-1 developing resistance to HIV protease inhibitors in individuals with uncontrolled or undiagnosed HIV-1 infection."/>
						<outline text="The most common adverse reactions in the PAXLOVID group ('¥1%) that occurred at a greater frequency than in the placebo group were dysgeusia (5% and &amp;lt;1%, respectively) and diarrhea (3% and 2%, respectively)."/>

						<outline text="Immune System Disorders: Anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactionsSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndromeNervous System Disorders: HeadacheVascular Disorders: HypertensionGastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomitingGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Malaise"/>
						<outline text="PAXLOVID is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, and an inhibitor of CYP2D6, P-gp, and OATP1B1. Coadministration of PAXLOVID with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2D6 or are transported by P-gp or OATP1B1 may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs and increase the risk of adverse events. Coadministration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring."/>
						<outline text="Pregnancy: Available data on the use of nirmatrelvir during pregnancy are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Published observational studies on ritonavir use in pregnant women have not identified an increase in the risk of major birth defects.

						<outline text="What are GLP-1 Weight Loss Drugs?Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs are used to manage type 2 diabetes and aid in weight loss. They mimic the action of a hormone called GLP-1, which helps control blood sugar, reduce appetite, and enhance satiety."/>
						<outline text="Here are the most common GLP-1 drugs:"/>
						<outline text="Semaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus)Exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon)Liraglutide (Victoza, Saxenda)Dulaglutide (Trulicity)Lixisenatide (Adlyxin)Albiglutide (withdrawn from the market)Exenatide Extended-Release (Bydureon)Efpeglenatide (Lyxumia, ZYOG1)Out of all, the most popular is Semaglutide."/>
						<outline text="In 2017, the FDA initially approved Semaglutide, marketed as Ozempic, from the pharmaceutical behemoth Novo Nordisk, to assist individuals with type 2 diabetes in managing their blood sugar levels."/>
						<outline text="In 2021, the FDA granted approval to Novo Nordisk for another semaglutide under the brand Wegovy, for people who have obesity or are overweight and have other health problems, like heart disease. "/>
						<outline text="Wegovy typically contains more of the active ingredient semaglutide (0.5, 1.0, 1.7 or 2.4 milligrams weekly) than Ozempic (0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 milligrams weekly)."/>
						<outline text="Why is Semaglutide so Popular among the GLP-1s?  Semaglutide has demonstrated strong effectiveness in lowering blood sugar levels and promoting weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes. Its shown impressive results in clinical trials, including the STEP program (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity). Many individuals using semaglutide have reported satisfaction with their ability to manage blood sugar levels and lose weight with this medication (both Ozempic and Wegovy). The availability of semaglutide in different formulations, such as injections and oral tablets, provides patients with options that cater to their preferences.  All of this is to say, patients and physicians are being driven to GLP-1s, particularly semaglutide, for managing obesity. This is a trend that is becoming increasingly prevalent in the United States as well as other countries. "/>
						<outline text="Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 vs Other Weight Loss MedicationGLP-1 agonists like Ozempic distinguish themselves from other weight loss medications by not only targeting appetite but also having metabolic effects beneficial for those with coexisting type 2 diabetes."/>
						<outline text="The weight loss prompted by GLP-1 drugs is also notably substantial compared to other available weight loss drugs, with studies showcasing a remarkable reduction in body weight among users."/>
						<outline text="Expected sales from 2020 vs 2024 of Ozempic (and other diabetes drugs):"/>
						<outline text="It's exploding. Of course, all this doesn't come without any concerns - physically, mentally, and economically - which we will discuss further below."/>
						<outline text="American Sentiment Towards GLP-1 Weight Loss DrugsThe rise in attention towards GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy highlights a blend of wariness and hope in the mindset of American consumers."/>
						<outline text="Interest &amp;amp; Concerns32% of adults in the United States who felt they needed to lose weight who were interested in trying select weight loss methods as of 2023"/>
						<outline text="Key Insights from a Morning Consult Survey:"/>
						<outline text="26% of U.S. adults are interested in trying these drugs.Concerns are evident: 70% worry about long-term effects, while 66% are anxious about short-term ones.2 in 3 adults are uneasy about the necessity for continual use and potential mental health challenges during usage."/>
						<outline text="33% of respondents for this survey believed GLP-1 medications to be safe (and 37% believed it to be effective):"/>
						<outline text="That may not seem very positive, especially when comparing to other weight loss methods polled, but have a look at a similar survey from 2016, and you'll see a trend occurring in regards to the perception of GLP-1 medication safety. "/>
						<outline text="Perceived Benefits50% and 55% believe the drugs can positively impact physical health and self-image respectively.Over 40% foresee advantages like promoting healthier eating and inspiring more physical activity.About 36% anticipate benefits in reducing compulsive/addictive behavior."/>
						<outline text="Prescription Priorities and Insurance Coverage52% feel that those needing the drugs for weight-related health issues should be prioritized.Only 11% believe priority should be given to those using them purely for weight loss.Regarding insurance, about 2 in 3 believe insurers should cover these drugs for weight-related health issues, and half feel coverage should extend to exclusive weight loss use too."/>
						<outline text="International ConcernReports from the UK and EU about stomach paralysis, excessive vomiting, and probes into suicidal thoughts related to these drugs amplify concerns."/>
						<outline text="Supply and Demand ChallengesRising demand vs. supply shortages creates a complex situation for those needing these drugs for medical and weight loss reasons."/>
						<outline text="As these GLP-1 drugs become more prominent, balancing the evident public interest with concerns and ethical distribution will be pivotal in their narrative moving forward."/>
						<outline text="Insights on Food Sales from Walmart"/>
						<outline text="In parallel, Walmart, the multinational retail corporation, showcases a distinct yet arguably related stance, particularly in the realm of food and nutritional accessibility. Walmart emphasizes providing consumers with affordable, nutritious options, likely recognizing the intrinsic link between diet, obesity, and the cascading demand for weight loss drugs. Through strategies like broadening their array of healthy food options and creating partnerships with health and wellness brands, Walmart indirectly addresses the surging interest in weight loss medications by aiming to mitigate the root issue: unhealthy dietary habits. "/>
						<outline text="There may have to be some balancing among the big consumer staple companies like General Mills or Kraft Heinz."/>
						<outline text="Benefits of GLP-1 drugsGLP-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1) weight loss drugs, such as Ozempic (semaglutide), are primarily designed to manage diabetes but have also gained attention for their ability to promote weight loss and are even under investigation for potential applications in treating neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease."/>
						<outline text="Researchers are exploring the efficacy of these drugs in improving glucose utilization and reducing inflammation throughout the body, including the brain, with the aim to potentially slow the progression of debilitating diseases. Notably, while Ozempic and similar drugs have shown promise in initial studies, conclusive results and applications in the field of neurodegenerative disease management are still under research and pending further trial outcomes. "/>
						<outline text="Take the potential applications in treating neurodegenerative disorders with a pinch of salt."/>
						<outline text="Furthermore, from an economic standpoint, industries may see shifts in demand patterns, which, if navigated adeptly, could pave the way for new market trends, particularly towards healthier product options."/>
						<outline text="Risks of GLP-1 weight loss medicationGLP-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1) receptor agonists, like Ozempic, bring tangible benefits in managing Type 2 diabetes and aiding weight loss but also come with potential risks. "/>
						<outline text="Physical Risks: Gastrointestinal Issues: Including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Pancreatitis: A concern though definitive links are under scrutiny. Hypoglycemia: Particularly when used with other anti-diabetic medications. Kidney Injury: Usually associated with dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea.Mental Health Concerns: An instance pointing toward mental health implications is highlighted by Jenny Kent, who experienced significant emotional disturbances upon using Ozempic, a drug approved for Type 2 diabetes and gaining popularity for its off-label use in weight loss."/>
						<outline text="As more people employ Ozempic to manage diabetes and speculate its efficacy in weight loss, reports to the FDA regarding potential side effects, particularly relating to mental health, have been on the ascent. Kent reported being persistently overwhelmed and tearful after beginning her regimen. This subjective experience is echoed in other cases too, although whether the emotional turmoil is directly related to Ozempic is still under question."/>
						<outline text="Regulatory Concerns and Investigations: The European Medicines Agency was, as of July 2023, investigating over 150 reports concerning self-harm and suicidal thoughts potentially linked to Ozempic and similar drugs. In contrast, the FDA has not progressed to an investigative stage but continues to monitor situations closely. The FDA has received 489 reports related to anxiety, depression, or suicidal thoughts with semaglutide drugs (including Ozempic), 96 of which involved suicidal thoughts, with five resulting in death.A Few Things Worth Considering:Database Challenges: Rishi Desai highlights the FAERS database's limits, noting its incapacity to establish causality between drugs and side effects due to its passive and unverified data nature.Clinical Trials' Relevance Questioned: Dr. Amy Rothberg indicates a potential misalignment between clinical trial parameters and real-world use, pointing out that mental health conditions were not represented in Ozempic's trials, possibly overlooking related side effects.Unwavering Confidence from Novo Nordisk: Despite emerging concerns, Novo Nordisk firmly backs Ozempic's safety and efficacy, vowing persistent surveillance and cooperation with regulatory bodies to ensure ongoing patient safety.Prioritizing Patient Safety: Given the promise of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic in diabetes management and weight loss, rising mental health concerns necessitate healthcare providers to uphold a vigilant, patient-oriented strategy, ensuring thorough monitoring, open patient communication, and rigorous validation of experiences to safeguard pharmacological use.Studies on Semaglutide1. Weight Loss Outcomes With Semaglutide TreatmentThe study found that semaglutide treatment at doses used in randomized clinical trials (1.7 mg and 2.4 mg) was associated with significant weight loss. At 3 months, patients achieved an average weight loss of 5.9%, and at 6 months, the weight loss increased to 10.9%. These results align with weight loss outcomes observed in randomized clinical trials. However, longer-term studies are needed to assess prolonged weight loss outcomes."/>
						<outline text="The study also highlighted that adverse effects were reported in approximately 50% of the cohort during follow-up, with gastrointestinal symptoms being the most commonly reported adverse effects, including nausea and vomiting."/>
						<outline text="2. Clinical Review Report of Semaglutide (Ozempic)The &quot;SUSTAIN-6&quot; was a cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) designed to assess the impact of Semaglutide on cardiovascular-related endpoints in patients with T2DM.

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="WASHINGTON'--In the midst of our nation's unprecedented opioid epidemic, which is killing 115 Americans every day, U.S. Senators Ed Markey (D-MA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Joe Manchin (D-VW) today urged the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to remove ultra-high dosage opioids from the market.  Ultra-high dose opioids are those which, when taken as directed by the label, exceed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) threshold for dangerously high daily opioid intake.  For example, the OxyContin 80mg tablet'--which is as powerful as 24 tablets of Vicodin'--can cause fatal respiratory depression when taken by a person without a high opioid tolerance. "/>
						<outline text="''Given the strength of a single dose of one of these opioids, it is shocking that such products remain on the market in the midst of our nation's opioid epidemic,'' the Senators wrote in a letter to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb.  ''We urge you to heed this important, potentially life-saving request.'' "/>
						<outline text="Several medical and public health stakeholders, including health commissioners of several states, have submitted a citizen petition under Section 355(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, asking the FDA to remove these high-dose opioid pills from the market given their outsized risks.  The latest CDC guidelines and recent medical studies recommend non-opioid treatment for most forms of pain.  However, cancer and palliative care patients who need high levels of pain medication would still be able to receive needed treatment by taking other pill formulations."/>
						<outline text="A particular concern with ultra-high dose opioids is accidental ingestion, borrowed medication, and recreational use.  Studies have shown that 12 million Americans misuse prescription opioids annually, and more than half of all misuse originates with a prescription opioid from a friend or relative.    "/>
						<outline text="Full text of the letter is available  here  and below:"/>
						<outline text="May 3, 2017"/>
						<outline text="Dear Commissioner Gottlieb:"/>
						<outline text="Our nation's unprecedented opioid epidemic, which is killing 115 Americans every day, requires a comprehensive response from all stakeholders.  Under your leadership, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has taken positive steps to reduce opioid addiction and overdose, including by expanding the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to immediate-release opioids, exploring ways to expand provider education, making packaging and labeling changes to protect against overconsumption, and requesting removal of Opana ER from the market due to its abuse potential.  We commend you for spearheading these important initiatives. Today, we write to urge you to take additional action to protect Americans from unsafe products that pose disproportionate overdose risk by removing ultra-high dosage opioids from the market."/>
						<outline text="Ultra-high dose opioids are those which, when taken as directed by the label, exceed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) threshold for dangerously high daily opioid intake of 90 morphine milligram equivalents.  For example, the OxyContin 80mg tablet, can cause fatal respiratory depression when taken by a person without a high opioid tolerance'--it is as powerful as 24 tablets of Vicodin.  Additionally, the Subsys fentanyl spray comes in doses equal to 58 Vicodin tablets.  Given the strength of a single dose of one of these opioids, it is shocking that such products remain on the market in the midst of our nation's opioid epidemic."/>
						<outline text="A particular concern with ultra-high dose opioids is accidental ingestion, borrowed medication, and recreational use.  Studies have shown that 12 million Americans misuse prescription opioids annually, and more than half of all misuse originates with a prescription opioid from a friend or relative.  It is our understanding that the FDA may have evidence and adverse events data to understand the scope of misuse from ultra-high dose opioids. "/>
						<outline text="Last year, the National Academy of Sciences issued a report outlining a new framework for the FDA's opioid approval and removal decisions.  We were pleased by your endorsement of this new approach that takes misuse potential into account when weighing the risks and benefits of opioid formulations.  Given that palliative and cancer-related pain patients who require high opioid doses could still receive adequate treatment with multiple pills, patches, or other formulations, we believe these ultra-high dose opioids can be removed from the market without imposing hardship on those with legitimate pain needs. "/>
						<outline text="We understand that several medical and public health stakeholders have submitted a citizen petition under Section 355(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, asking the FDA to remove these high-dose opioid pills from the market given their outsized risks. We urge you to heed this important, potentially life-saving request.  We appreciate your commitment to using all tools at the FDA's disposal to help address the opioid crisis. "/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="Last month, Target abruptly announced it would soon shutter three of its Portland locations for good. The company cited threats to employee safety and organized retail crime as reasons for the closures, which begin Saturday."/>
						<outline text="Emails obtained by WW sent from Target executives to Mayor Ted Wheeler's office offer more details about Target's concerns, and also provide insight into apparently unsuccessful efforts by officials inside Wheeler's office to appease those concerns."/>
						<outline text="In May 2022, Skylar Brocker-Knapp, a top policy adviser in the mayor's office, met with senior Target executives at the company's new store in Hollywood, which had just opened a year earlier. In preparation for the meeting, Target's government affairs director Kent Wilson forwarded Brocker-Knapp a letter from the store's director, Brittany Munoz, providing ''added context.''"/>
						<outline text="The litany of concerns laid out in the letter might sound familiar. The store's rear wall was repeatedly vandalized with graffiti, which would reappear within hours of being painted over. Drug paraphernalia and needles littered the parking lot. A nearby homeless encampment kept popping back up after being targeted by intermittent city sweeps."/>
						<outline text="''We have seen many repeat offenders with multiple police report cases filed who continue to roam the streets and come into our store daily to steal without fear of being reprimanded,'' wrote Munoz, who included a list: five harassment cases, 30 cases of disorderly conduct, and one assault."/>
						<outline text="The assault described in the letter occurred in January: a 19-year-old employee was shoved by a thief who'd snuck into a backroom to steal electronics. Months later, police still hadn't solved the case even though the suspect ''is still seen in my building,'' Munoz wrote."/>
						<outline text="''A number of times when we have called law enforcement for support on these issues, we have received long wait times to speak to a dispatcher, as well as long response times waiting for police or no police response at all,'' she wrote."/>
						<outline text="She noted the 19-year-old was a college student who quit immediately following the assault. ''This has also impacted the retention of our team and our ability to staff,'' she added."/>
						<outline text="A spokesman for the Portland Police Bureau was unable to immediately offer more information about the incident."/>
						<outline text="The subsequent meeting between Brocker-Knapp and Target executives went well. ''Everyone was so thankful for the work that you're doing, and they loved having you visit the store,'' Wilson told Brocker-Knapp."/>
						<outline text="Over the following year, the relationship between the mayor's office and Target appeared to warm."/>
						<outline text="The mayor's director of economic development, Andrew Fitzpatrick, wrote Wilson in August to see if there was anything Target could do to ''address EBT conversion to cash for the purchase of illicit drugs.'' In other words, the purchase of bottled water or similar products with government food vouchers for the purpose of redeeming the containers for cash."/>
						<outline text="''It may help reduce the overall incidence of crime in the vicinity,'' Fitzpatrick wrote. Wilson responded that he was happy to help, and could introduce the mayor's office to other retailers like Walgreens and CVS."/>
						<outline text="The correspondence culminated in a pair of meetings between high-level Portland officials and top Target executives."/>
						<outline text="Portland Police Bureau Deputy Chief Mike Frome had an ''in-person meeting'' with Target's director of public safety in February. And Wheeler himself met with top Target executives, including its vice president of asset protection, Oscar Arango, in the lobby of a Washington, D.C., Hilton during a national conference in January."/>
						<outline text="Wilson emailed Fitzpatrick to report that ''Oscar was raving about Mayor Wheeler and how he was actually engaged.''"/>
						<outline text="But problems were mounting. In June, Wilson reported further issues at the Hollywood store and Galleria location downtown, highlighting particularly ''burglaries in storage rooms'' and ''awful issues with the bottle bill,'' which requires the store to allow people to redeem bottles and cans for cash."/>
						<outline text="''We recently had an individual in one of our stores that was peeling off his face with pliers in the bathroom,'' explained Wilson."/>
						<outline text="''The redemption situation at many retailers and grocers is incredibly frustrating,'' Fitzpatrick acknowledged."/>
						<outline text="The next email communication, provided to WW by the mayor's office in response to a public records request, came in late September, when Wilson gave Fitzpatrick a heads-up that Target was permanently closing the two stores'--and one more on Southeast Powell Boulevard."/>
						<outline text="''News will be public at 12 pm your time,'' Wilson wrote in a terse message Sept. 26."/>

						<outline text="The U.S. Department of Energy on Friday selected the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association's PNWH2 Hub for award negotiations as one of the nation's seven Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs following a competitive nationwide process, according to a news release from the Washington State Department of Commerce."/>
						<outline text="PNWH2 Hub could receive up to $1 billion in federal funding over nine years for its projects."/>
						<outline text="The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association is a multistate nonprofit coalition of public and private partners spanning Washington, Oregon, and Montana, and includes representatives from tribal nations, labor, business and industry, higher education, government, and the environmental community."/>
						<outline text="DOE's H2Hubs will kickstart a national network of clean hydrogen producers, consumers, and connective infrastructure while supporting the production, storage, delivery, and end-use of clean hydrogen. The H2Hubs, funded by President Biden's Investing in America agenda, will accelerate the commercial-scale deployment of clean hydrogen '-- helping generate clean, dispatchable power, create a new form of energy storage, and decarbonize heavy industry and transportation, the release said."/>
						<outline text="Together, they also will reduce 25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions from end-uses each year '-- an amount roughly equivalent to combined annual emissions of 5.5 million gasoline-powered cars '-- and create tens of thousands of good-paying jobs across the country while supporting healthier communities and strengthening America's energy security, the release added."/>
						<outline text="The PNWH2 Hub will leverage the abundant clean power and innovative technology companies in the Pacific Northwest to accelerate the transition to clean hydrogen production and use. The hub will focus on decarbonizing the region's hard-to-electrify heavy-duty transportation, long-duration energy storage, ports, agriculture, and industrial operations, the Commerce Department said."/>
						<outline text="''Washington state and our many partners in this effort got here today because we have the commitment to innovation, nation-leading climate policies and economic bona fides to build even more clean energy resources here in Washington,'' Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement. ''This hub will be another example that the transition to all renewable energy is not only saving our planet but contributing to robust economic growth. The projects in this hub will support thousands of new jobs in Washington and the Northwest, while slashing emissions in sectors such as heavy-duty transportation, maritime, agriculture, and industrial operations.''"/>
						<outline text="DOE and the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association will negotiate the final funding and scope for the hub beginning this fall. Companies with projects proposed as part of the PNWH2 Hub are: Air Liquide Hydrogen Energy US LLC, Amazon.com Inc., ALA Renewable Energy LLC, Atlas Agro, Centralia College, Mitsubishi Power Americas Inc., Northwest Seaport Alliance, NovoHydrogen Development Inc., PACCAR Inc., Portland General Electric Co., Puget Sound Energy, PUD No. 1 of Douglas County, Regis Solar LLC, Synchronous LLC dba First Mode, Twin Transit, USA Fortescue Future Industries Inc., and Williams Field Services Group LLC."/>
						<outline text="The PNWH2 Hub is eligible to receive up to $1 billion in federal funding over four DOE-defined development phases spanning nine years, with $20 million allocated for Phase 1. DOE will evaluate the hub's activities and deliver go/no-go decisions at each phase."/>
						<outline text="The PNWH2 Hub will kick off Phase 1, which includes detailed project planning, in early 2024 to refine projections submitted in the proposal and provide assurance to DOE that the overall hydrogen hub concept and proposed projects are technologically, financially and legally viable, with buy-in from local stakeholders. Project partners, who have been engaging with local communities for many months, will build on this groundwork with extensive community and labor engagement in Phase 1, the release said."/>
						<outline text="The PNWH2 Hub's proposal was developed by a team of experts from each proposed project led by federal engineering, procurement and construction contractor Atkins. Guidance was provided by the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association Board and the Advisory Committee, as well as through community and partner feedback."/>

						<outline text="Israel since Oct. 7 has been at war with Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip. The conflict has claimed more than 4,000 lives and counting on both sides after Hamas's deadly surprise assault on Israel by land, air and sea.  "/>
						<outline text="The conflict has unsettled the region, with U.S. officials concerned that the Iran-backed Hezbollah might choose to open a second front in the fight. Hezbollah and Israel last fought a monthlong war in 2006.  "/>

						<outline text="2010 air crash near the city of Smolensk, Russia"/>
						<outline text="On 10 April 2010, a Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft operating Polish Air Force Flight 101 crashed near the Russian city of Smolensk, killing all 96 people on board. Among the victims were the president of Poland, Lech KaczyÅski, and his wife, Maria; the former president of Poland in exile, Ryszard Kaczorowski; the chief of the Polish General Staff and other senior Polish military officers; the president of the National Bank of Poland; Polish government officials; 18 members of the Polish parliament; senior members of the Polish clergy; and relatives of victims of the Katyn massacre. The group was arriving from Warsaw to attend an event commemorating the 70th anniversary of the massacre, which took place not far from Smolensk."/>
						<outline text="The pilots were attempting to land at Smolensk North Airport '-- a former military airbase '-- in thick fog, with visibility reduced to about 500 metres (1,600 ft). The aircraft descended far below the normal approach path until it struck trees, rolled, inverted and crashed into the ground, coming to rest in a wooded area a short distance from the runway.[2]"/>
						<outline text="Both the Russian and Polish official investigations found no technical faults with the aircraft, and concluded that the crew failed to conduct the approach in a safe manner in the given weather conditions. The Polish authorities found serious deficiencies in the organization and training of the Air Force unit involved, which was subsequently disbanded. Several high-ranking members of the Polish military resigned following pressure from politicians and the media."/>
						<outline text="Various conspiracy theories have been circulated alleging that the plane had been deliberately brought down by the Russians in an act of political assassination, with these theories also typically alleging that the 2011 investigations constituted a cover-up and that the Polish government of the time '-- primarily controlled by the Civic Platform party as opposed to Lech KaczyÅski's Law and Justice party '-- was complicit in or aware of the plot or at least aided in the efforts to cover it up.[3] While neither of the 2011 investigations reported any evidence supporting these claims, with the Polish investigation also examining whether Russian air control failures were a contributory factor in the crash,[2] the conspiracy theories are regularly promoted by the Law and Justice party and its supporters in general[4] and by party leader JarosÅaw KaczyÅski, twin brother of Lech KaczyÅski, and deputy party leader Antoni Macierewicz in particular,[5][6][7][8] and were given an official veneer following the 2022 conclusion of a further investigation by the Polish government, which by then was being led by the Law and Justice party.[9][10] The new report did not produce any evidence that could conclusively challenge the 2011 reports,[3] and was later indicated to have been the subject of tampered evidence.[11]"/>
						<outline text="Background Purpose of the flight The flight's purpose was taking many high-ranking Polish officials to ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre, a mass murder of Polish intellectuals, politicians, and military officers by the Soviets during World War II. The site of the massacre is approximately 19 km (12 mi) west of Smolensk. The area is fairly remote; Smolensk is the only city nearby and has the only two airports in the area: Smolensk North Airport, where the accident occurred, and Smolensk South Airport."/>
						<outline text="Destination airport Russian servicemen, accompanied by a policeman, twist bulbs into the approach lights of Smolensk North Airport's runway, hours after the crash of the Tu-154Smolensk North Airport is a former military airbase, presently in mixed military-civilian use. At the time of the crash, the airport was not equipped with an ICAO-compliant instrument landing system (ILS), the standard system used in most developed countries. The airport used to have a Russian-made landing system installed, which was decommissioned after civilian operations started.[12] The Polish Tu-154 was modified to use a Western-style ILS.[citation needed ] A non-directional beacon (NDB) was installed at the airport,[13] but such a device is essentially a navigational aid, and can be used only for non-precision approaches, where it can guide the pilot to align with the runway, but offers no vertical guidance on how to descend towards the runway.[14] The airport was equipped also with both a surveillance and landing radar.[12] The lowest approved visibility conditions to land (approach minimums) were cloud base 100 meters (330 ft) and visibility 1,000 meters (3,300 ft).[12]"/>
						<outline text="The ground visual navigation aids on 10 April 2010 were not effective. According to the Polish report, the radar was unstable and swung within ±10%.[15] From the photographic documentation of the Polish committee, it appears that the origin of components of the Smolensk North lighting system was unknown. This was not the Luch-2MU system as the Russians stated. The report from the inspection flight performed on 15 April 2010 stated that the approach lamps, depending on their location and on the altitude of an inbound aircraft, can be obscured by surrounding trees and shrubs when an aircraft is at a distance of 400, 700, and 800 metres from Runway 26. The lamps of the first group (900 m) had their light filters shattered and, of three bulbs installed, only one was serviceable.[15]"/>
						<outline text="Aircraft 101, the aircraft involved in the accident, seen in 2008The aircraft was a Tupolev Tu-154M of the 36th Special Aviation Regiment of the Polish Air Force (SiÅy Powietrzne), tail number 101. Built in 1990 at the Kuybyshev Aviation Plant as msn 90A837, it first flew on 29 June 1990. At the time of the accident, the airframe had accumulated more than 5,150 hours in 4,000 cycles. The service life of the Tu-154M is more than 25 years or 30,000 hours or 15,000 cycles (whichever comes first). All three Soloviev D-30KU-154 engines were within the service limits of 24,000 hours or 11,100 cycles.[12]"/>
						<outline text="101 was one of two Tupolev Tu-154s that served as official government jets; the other with a tail number of 102 was a year younger and at the time of the accident it was being overhauled in the Aviakor aviation plant in Samara. The 101 aircraft had undergone a major overhaul in December 2009, and Alexey Gusev, the head of the maintenance plant that carried out the work, told Polish TV that it should not have had technical problems.[16] The crash happened 138 flight-hours after the most recent overhaul.[17]"/>
						<outline text="The aircraft used the callsign Polish Airforce 101, operating flight PLF101. PLF is the ICAO three-letter designator for the Polish Air Force, used to identify the operator of an aircraft by air traffic control."/>
						<outline text="Crew The cockpit crew of Flight 101 consisted of pilot Captain Arkadiusz Protasiuk, 36, co-pilot Major Robert Grzywna, 36, navigator Lieutenant Artur ZiÄtek, 32, and flight engineer WO2 Andrzej Michalak. Protasiuk had landed at Smolensk three days earlier on 7 April in the same Tu-154; he served as first officer on that flight.[12] Protasiuk had 3,531 flight hours, including 2,906 hours on the Tu-154. Co-pilot Grzywna had 1,909 hours, with 475 of them on the Tu-154. ZiÄtek had 1,050 hours, only 58 of them on the Tu-154. Michalak had only 329 flight hours, all on the Tu-154.[12]"/>
						<outline text="Flight sequence Take-off and cruise Map of the origin and destination of the accident flightFlight PLF101[18] took off from Warsaw at 9:27 Smolensk time after a delay of 27 minutes.[12]"/>
						<outline text="As the aircraft left Warsaw, weather conditions were rapidly deteriorating at Smolensk. A temperature inversion had developed, trapping moisture low in the atmosphere and causing a dense fog to develop.[12] At 9:15 Smolensk time, about an hour and a half before the crash, a Yakovlev Yak-40 jet (flight PLF 031)[12] also belonging to the Polish government[19] and carrying Polish journalists from the President's press pool landed at the airbase without incident, though conditions were rapidly worsening at the time.[citation needed ] Shortly thereafter, between 9:20 and 9:39 MSD, a Russian Ilyushin Il-76 (tail number 78817) made two attempts to land,[12] but because of low visibility, it diverted to Vnukovo Airport near Moscow.[20] Upon PLF101's approach to the base, atmospheric conditions continued to worsen, and the fog continued to thicken, further reducing visibility to 400 metres (1,300 ft).[12] The ground control personnel stated to PLF101 that there were no conditions for landing.[12] The Captain then requested and was given permission to conduct a &quot;trial&quot; approach.[12] The controllers instructed the captain as to the landing minimum of 100 metres (330 ft), to which the captain replied, &quot;Yes, sir!&quot;[12]"/>
						<outline text="Stress and workload factors Meanwhile, the situation in the cockpit was one of very high stress.[12] As the weather continued to worsen, the crew became increasingly aware of the extreme difficulty they would encounter in landing at Smolensk. The crew may have feared a negative reaction from their passengers should they have to divert to an alternative airfield.[12] The protocol director was present in the cockpit from time to time, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Air Force was present in the cockpit[verification needed ] for the final approach phase of the flight, including the crash itself.[12][needs update ] At one point, the navigator is heard on the CVR saying &quot;He'll go crazy&quot;, a possible reference to the President of Poland, should the crew choose to divert.[21] There may also have been some friction between the Air Force Commander and the captain, caused by an absence in the latter of condition training.[22]"/>
						<outline text="The captain and first officer's decision making may have also been affected by knowledge of a 2008 flight when the President of Poland ordered a change in destination right before departure and again while airborne. The captain and first officer had been the first officer and navigator, respectively, on that flight. Lacking charts or a flight plan for the new destination, the captain of that flight had decided he could not bring the aircraft to the new destination safely. Disobeying the President and a high-ranking Polish Air Force commander on board, the captain flew on to the originally planned destination. The Polish prosecutor's office would later clear that captain of any wrongdoing in relation to that flight, and he was even awarded a silver medal of merit for national defence.[23] However, in the final report issued by The Interstate Aviation Committee (Russian: Ð'ÐµÐ¶Ð&quot;Ð¾ÑÑÐ´Ð°ÑÑÑÐ²ÐµÐ½Ð½ÑÐ¹ Ð°Ð²Ð¸Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð¾Ð½Ð½ÑÐ¹ ÐºÐ¾Ð¼Ð¸ÑÐµÑ , abbr. Ð'ÐÐ  )'--a supervising body overseeing the use and management of civil aviation in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)'--it was stated he had not been assigned to fly the President again since.[12] Polish sources state he flew the President to New York in September 2008, despite objections voiced by the President.[23] The captain involved in the 2008 incident flew the Polish Prime Minister to Smolensk on 7 April without the President on board, but he was removed from the crew of the 10 April flight which carried the President.[24] Knowledge of the 2008 incident and its repercussions may have weighed on the crew of PLF101, potentially placing additional pressure on them to complete their flight to the original destination.[12]"/>
						<outline text="Complicating the situation was the increased workload on the captain. Normally, one pilot flies the aeroplane while another crew member handles radio communications. On Flight 101, the responsibility for communication usually rests with the navigator. At Smolensk however the situation was different. As the airport is not usually open for international flights and is not ICAO certified, the air traffic controllers were not required to be fluent in English, the ICAO standard language for air traffic control (ATC) communication. Accordingly, all communication between Smolensk's ATC and Flight 101 was carried out in Russian. Russian law requires international flights landing at military airports to have a Russian &quot;leaderman&quot; (navigator; Russian: Ð&gt;&gt;Ð¸Ð´Ð¸ÑÐ¾Ð²ÑÐ¸Ðº , romanized: lidir&quot;vÅÄik ) on board the flight, who is then responsible for this ATC communication, done in Russian.[12] In the middle of March, as part of their request for permission to conduct the flight, Poland asked for leaderman services and the latest airport data for Smolensk. At the end of March, after apparently having received no reply to their first request, Poland tendered a second request for permission to fly, but did not request leaderman services in this second request. As a spokesperson for the Air Force Command said: &quot;The Russian side has not confirmed readiness to secure the flight leader&quot;.[25][26] According to the Final Report, however, Russia did offer leaderman services, but Poland refused, stating their crew had satisfactory knowledge of Russian and could conduct the flight without a leaderman.[12] In reality, the captain was the only member of the crew who could speak Russian adequately.[12] Accordingly, upon being handed off'--transferred'--to Smolensk ATC, the captain took over communication duties from the navigator. In a normal situation, this would dictate that the first officer be the pilot actually flying the aeroplane, but as the weather was bad, the captain, as the most experienced member of the crew, elected to fly the aeroplane as well.[12] Thus, the captain was simultaneously performing two tasks that would normally be split up, dividing his attention and increasing his workload.[12]"/>
						<outline text="Approach 101 landing at Prague Airport less than two days before the accidentUnder these stresses, the crew continued their approach pattern and readied the aircraft for final descent. Radios were tuned to the two Non-Directional Beacons (NDBs) present at the field, and the autopilot was set up to use waypoints from the Flight Management System (FMS) units for navigation. The crew used their second radio to contact the Yak-40 which had landed earlier, inquiring as to the weather conditions. The Yak-40 crew replied, &quot;Well, generally it's absolute shit here,&quot; and that, &quot;(we) were lucky to land at the last moment.&quot;[12] The Yak-40 crew estimated visibility was 200 metres (660 ft), but told PLF101, &quot;you might try...(to make an approach).&quot;[12] The crew of PLF 101 acknowledged this information and continued their approach. As the aircraft approached the outer marker, the crew issued pitch commands (via the CLIMB-DESCEND wheel) to the autopilot. This is not recommended for the Tu-154, as the autopilot cannot maintain vertical speed accurately enough for the approach phase of flight; manual flight mode is instead recommended. Although the crew had not requested it, the radar controller began issuing reports to Flight 101 concerning their distance from the runway and whether or not they were on the glidepath.[12] The Polish report noted that on multiple occasions the radar controller stated the aeroplane was on the glidepath when it was not."/>
						<outline text="The Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) fired its first audible warning &quot;terrain ahead!&quot; at 10:40:06. This was because the Smolensk airport, as a former military airfield not open to international flights, was not in the system's database and therefore the system did not recognize that the aeroplane was approaching an airport.[27] Six seconds later, someone (most likely the captain or navigator) pressed a button on the captain's FMS panel commanding standard barometric pressure be set on the captain's main electronic altimeter. This had the effect of increasing the altimeter's reading by 170 metres (560 ft); as the TAWS takes readings from this particular altimeter, this had the additional effect of silencing the warning.[12] The captain's secondary (mechanical) and the copilot's main electronic pressure altimeters continued to read correctly.[12] As the descent continued, the crew realized they had started descent too late. To compensate for this, they increased their vertical speed to 8 metres per second (26 ft/s), twice the prescribed rate for a normal approach. The aircraft did not have enough drag to maintain speed with this rate of descent, so even though the auto-throttles commanded idle power from the engines, the speed of the aircraft increased to approximately 35 km/h (22 mph) higher than specified.[12]"/>
						<outline text="Approaching 300 metres (980 ft), the navigator began calling out the radar altimeter's reading. This is not standard practice for a non-precision approach, as the radar altimeter does not take into account the contour of the terrain around the airport. Standard practice would entail calling out the readings on the pressure altimeter, which is set according to atmospheric pressure and thereby references the elevation of the actual airport. The terrain on approach to Smolensk airport is uneven and locally much lower than the runway level.[12]"/>
						<outline text="Warning signs At 200 metres (660 ft), the engines were still at idle power. Power settings for jet engines are expressed in instrument readings and flight data recorders as percentages labelled as &quot;N1&quot; and &quot;N2&quot;. N1 and N2 refer to the spools, or shafts, of a jet engine on which the compressor and turbine blades are mounted; jet engine power is measured as a percentage of maximum N1 or N2 rpm.[28] Although the shafts are not mechanically connected, the speed of one spool can be calculated based on the speed of the other spool and atmospheric conditions.[28] The Tu-154 manual indicates that a go-around must be initiated at 200 m if the engines are running at or below 75% N2.[12] This is because jet engine throttle response is not linear; jet engines have to &quot;spool up&quot; in order to produce more thrust.[28] At power settings higher than 78%, this response is almost instantaneous; at idle power, it can take a full 8 seconds for a jet engine to &quot;spool up&quot; to full power.[28] On PLF101, the N2 values were not recorded by the flight data recorder (FDR). The N1 values were, and at 200 m they indicated 32''33% N1. 75% N2 equates to 51''52% N1 for the given conditions.[12] Thus, the engines were well below the 75% minimum N2 reading, and the crew should have initiated a go-around at this point, even though they were still above Decision Height (DH). However, they did not go around, and continued the descent. The Final Report would later determine that a go-around was technically possible from as low as 40 m, but that 200 m was the first of many times that the crew were required to go around, but did not.[12]"/>
						<outline text="At 180 metres (590 ft), the &quot;terrain ahead!&quot; warning again sounded on the flight deck. The crew continued the descent. According to MAK's report, at 100 metres (330 ft) (Decision Height) there was no &quot;landing&quot; or &quot;go-around&quot; call by the captain. If this happens, the first officer is supposed to overrule the captain, take control of the aeroplane, and initiate a go-around.[12] Poland suggests that at this point the captain said &quot;Go around&quot;, and 8 seconds later the first officer confirmed by saying &quot;go around&quot;[30][31] (only the second of these two statements is recorded in the official transcripts by MAK; the first one may have been obscured by a simultaneous report by TAWS). Despite these calls, neither pilot initiated a go-around, and the descent continued.  One second after the 100 m altitude was reached, the TAWS alert &quot;PULL UP&quot; activated and continued to sound for the remainder of the flight. &quot;PULL UP&quot; activates only when the TAWS computer believes a collision with terrain is imminent. Thus, when &quot;PULL UP&quot; sounds, the crew is supposed to begin an immediate, maximum performance emergency climb (full power and angle of attack to the maximum permissible without stalling) and continue climbing until the warning stops.[32] However, the crew continued the descent.[12] There is a method of setting up the TAWS to prevent false warnings when flying into airports not in the database, known as &quot;terrain inhibit&quot; mode; however, the crew did not utilize it.[12] Even if they had, an excessive rate of descent and excessive airspeed can cause the TAWS to issue a &quot;SINK RATE&quot; warning followed by a &quot;PULL UP&quot; warning.[33] This point (10:40:40 local time, approximately 20 seconds before the collision with terrain) is also notable because this was the moment when the aircraft had crossed the minimum allowed approach slope for this airport (2°10'). Prior to this moment, the radar controller had no reason to think that the landing attempt was not proceeding normally. The behaviour of the controller was later the subject of some criticism by the Polish media. The controller remained silent for about 12 seconds after the aircraft passed the 100 m mark, and, even at that point, he did not order a go-around, but, rather issued an instruction to transit from a descent to a horizontal flight. (The decision to go around was apparently reached in the cabin of the aircraft within a few seconds of that instruction.)[12] In addition, according to some interpretations of the radio exchange between the ground and the aircraft, the crew was instructed by the ground control to descend to 120 metres (390 ft) and either to wait for clearance to land or request one explicitly,[34] or to inform the ground control regarding their decision whether to land or to go around.[35] (According to MAK's report, it meant that the crew was supposed to inform the ground control of their decision to land before passing the decision altitude, and that the ground control was supposed to allow the landing as long as the runway and the airspace were clear.) None of this ever happened, with the aircraft continuing the descent through the 120 m mark while the ground control remained silent."/>
						<outline text="For the next several seconds, the crew continued to call out &quot;100 meters&quot; as read from the radar altimeter. The aircraft was flying into a valley at this time and actually descended by 60''70 metres (200''230 ft).[12] The crew began calling out radar altitude every 10 metres (33 ft). At 60 metres (200 ft) radar altitude (where the crew had set their radar altitude bugs), the First Officer called out &quot;Go around&quot; (this is the &quot;confirmation&quot; go around call referred to in the Polish comment above). Due to the terrain in the area, the aircraft was actually only 15 metres (49 ft) above runway level at the time. Simultaneously to this callout, the FDR recorded a brief pull on the control column, likely done by the first officer, as he instinctively started the go-around sequence of actions. According to the investigation, this attempt at a go-around was completely overridden by the auto-pilot, which was still active, and, in any event, it was not completed (protocol requires that the correct sequence of operations during a go-around attempt involves increasing thrust to takeoff mode and disengaging the autopilot, neither action was done at the time).[12] Flight simulator testing by the investigation concluded that had the first officer completed a go-around at this point, the crash would likely have been avoided despite the violation of minimums and the excessive rate of descent.[12] The investigation found that this was the last moment at which a go-around could have been successful.[12]"/>
						<outline text="Point of no return As the crew called out &quot;50 meters&quot;, the controller instructed &quot;level 101&quot;, telling the aircraft to terminate descent. At 20 metres (66 ft), another controller instructed &quot;Check altitude, level.&quot; Simultaneously with this final call, the control column was pulled full aft, commanding max pitch up from the aircraft, and the throttles were moved within one second from their flight idle positions to maximum power. The aircraft, due to the valley terrain, was actually 15 metres (49 ft) below the runway at this time. The Russian investigation surmised that at this moment the flight crew saw the trees through the fog, and instinctively reacted in an attempt to escape their grave predicament. The crew did not disengage the autopilot, but the action of commanding maximum pitch up on the control column overrode it, causing the pitch channel to disengage. The control column briefly moved to neutral at this point, then moved full aft and remained there for the duration of the flight.[12] According to the Polish report, the command &quot;level&quot; ordering a change to horizontal flight was issued at a time when the aircraft was at an altitude of about 14 metres (46 ft) above airfield level. Two seconds before the &quot;level&quot; command, the aircraft commander made the decision to go around. According to the Polish committee's findings, the command to level should have been issued 10 seconds sooner, when the aircraft was well below the glide path.[15]"/>
						<outline text="Soon after, the aircraft began hitting trees. One, a large birch with a trunk 30 to 40 cm (12 to 16 in) wide, ripped off about 6.5 metres (21 ft) of the left wing, including the left aileron. The resulting asymmetrical lift caused an uncommanded roll to the left. Within five seconds, the aircraft was inverted, hitting the ground with the left wing, followed very shortly after by the nose. The nose impact resulted in forces exceeding 100g, which killed everyone on board instantly.[12] Even without the birch tree and subsequent roll, the excessive angle of attack would have led to an aerodynamic stall approximately two seconds after impact with that tree, which would also have led to a fatal accident.[12] According to the Polish report, safety areas around every aerodrome are mandated by international regulations (including Polish and Russian law) to prevent situations where aircraft or aerodrome operation could be compromised by obstacles in the immediate vicinity. A thorough analysis of terrain reveals that obstacles were present in the safety area, with many trees exceeding the permitted height limit (mostly about 10''11 metres (33''36 ft)).[15]"/>
						<outline text="After the nose hit, the aircraft was violently torn apart by impact forces.[12] The wreckage came to rest upside down about 200 metres (660 ft) before the runway threshold and slightly left of its centreline. The largest pieces remaining were the wing roots (the strongest part of an aeroplane), the wingtips and the tail section. The tail section came to rest backwards, relative to the direction of flight. A small post-impact fire ensued, but was quickly brought under control by the emergency services.[12]"/>
						<outline text="The governor of Smolensk Oblast, Sergey Antufyev, confirmed that there were no survivors of the crash. Pictures from the scene showed parts of the aircraft charred and strewn through a wooded area.[36] The Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, said that the bodies of those killed in the crash would be brought to Moscow for identification.[37] KaczyÅski's body was identified in Smolensk and was flown directly to Warsaw on the afternoon of 11 April.[38]"/>
						<outline text="Investigation As the accident occurred on Russian soil, Russia was tasked by ICAO procedure with primary responsibility for investigation, which it carried out with international cooperation. Poland also set up its own committee to investigate the crash, and prosecutors in both countries began criminal investigations."/>

The committee is headquartered in Moscow, Russia.[39]"/>
						<outline text="Within hours of the crash, the president of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, announced the establishment of a special commission for the investigation of the accident. The commission was to be supervised by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.[40][41][42] An Investigation Committee of the Prosecutor General of Russia started a criminal case in accordance with a &quot;violation of the safety rules&quot; of the Russian Criminal Code.[43]"/>
						<outline text="Flight recorders Two flight recorders, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR), were recovered undamaged from the crash site during the afternoon/early evening of 10 April, as was confirmed by Sergey Shoygu, the Russian minister of emergency situations.[44] That evening, it was reported that the CVR recordings confirmed the crew attempted to land against the advice of air traffic controllers.[citation needed ] A third flight recorder, a Quick Access Recorder (QAR) designed for maintenance diagnostics, was found on 12 April.[45] The two Flight Management System (FMS) units were also recovered.[12] The investigation was able to obtain information from the electronic memories of the Quick Access Recorder and one of the FMS units, despite the fact that they were not designed to withstand a crash. Since the FMS units are linked together, being able to read the memory of one meant the investigation was able to determine the actions performed by both units.[12] It would later be discovered that the FDR was partially defective and had occasional gaps in its data, but as the QAR managed to survive the crash, by synchronizing the data from the two units, a complete picture of flight data emerged.[12]"/>
						<outline text="On the day after the crash, investigators said they had reviewed the flight recorders, and confirmed that there were no technical problems with the Soviet-built aeroplane, ruling out initial theories that the 20-year-old aircraft was at fault. Alexei Gusev, general director of the Aviakor factory, said that the aircraft's three engines had been repaired and technicians had upgraded the plane's avionics at a recent overhaul the previous year. He said that there were no doubts about the plane's airworthiness.[46]"/>
						<outline text="Search for human remains Ewa Kopacz, former Polish Minister of Health, claimed before the Sejm that after the crash, ground was dug to a depth of one metre, and even if a tiny piece of human flesh was found, it was genetically tested. However, in the transcript released online by the Sejm, the meaning of her speech was changed: that when a small piece of flesh was found, the ground was dug to a depth of one metre. Moreover, in September 2010, one of the Polish pilgrims to Smolensk found a jaw with teeth and two other bones.[47]"/>
						<outline text="Russian cooperation Russia offered full cooperation to Polish prosecutors during the investigation.[48] According to the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) Polish investigators in Russia have been given access to all procedures of Russian investigators. However, Edmund Klich, the head of the Polish investigative commission, said that &quot;Poland does not have a lot of things that (we) would like to have&quot; and as an example gives lack of documentation of Smolensk airport and regulations about Air Control.[49] Polish investigators do not have the authority to conduct investigative actions by themselves, but they participated on equal terms with their Russian counterparts in the interviews with people involved and other parts of the investigation. Polish officials were to secure all Polish state documents found in the wreckage, as well as electronic devices (portable computers and mobile telephones) belonging to government officials and military officers. In turn Russian investigators received from Poland materials secured after the crash, including those about the technical state of the aircraft and fitness of the pilot. The Polish investigation results were to be based in part on Russian findings, but they are not bound by the results of the Russian investigation. Preliminary results of the investigations were to be released on the Thursday after the crash (including the cockpit voice recordings), but this was postponed until after the weekend when the funeral of the Presidential couple was to take place,[48][50] then postponed indefinitely until the full analysis was completed. The Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder, both of Soviet design, were analyzed in Russia with the participation of Polish experts.[12] The Quick Access Recorder, designed and produced in Poland, was sent to Poland and analysed there, with the participation of Russian experts.[51] The Flight Management System units, manufactured in the United States, were analyzed there with the participation of the FAA, NTSB, Polish experts, and Russian experts.[12]"/>
						<outline text="Airport and pilot communication The airport's traffic control communicated with the pilots in Russian, and one of the controllers claimed the Polish crew had problems communicating in this language.[52] However, according to Tomasz Pietrzak, the former commander of the Polish 36th Special Aviation Regiment, the captain of PLF101 was fluent in Russian and English.[52] The Captain had landed in Smolensk three days before the crash, when he was part of the crew bringing Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk to the 7 April ceremony, and at the time no communication problems with ground control were reported.[53] However, while the captain knew Russian, the rest of the crew did not, in particular the navigator whose task it is to communicate with the ground,[54] thus placing an additional workload on the captain. Previous flights to Smolensk had been accompanied by a Russian navigator, but none was provided for the April 2010 flights, with differing reasons for this given by Polish and Russian sides.[54] The final accident report would later conclude that the captain's knowledge of Russian was &quot;satisfactory.&quot;[12]"/>
						<outline text="The airport, which normally should have been closed due to the severe conditions, was not declared closed as its management feared that this could cause a diplomatic incident.[55] According to the news agency Interfax, the pilot was told that Smolensk North Airport was enveloped in thick fog and strongly advised against landing, but still he decided to continue with the original flight plan and attempt a landing.[56] According to an interview with a flight controller Pavel Plusnin[57] it was suggested to the pilot that he land at an alternative airfield in Moscow or Minsk. According to Plusnin, the pilot said, that he would attempt one approach, and if landing was not possible, he would then divert to another airfield.[52]"/>
						<outline text="There was some concern in the press as to whether or not Russian military ATC had the authority to issue military orders to Flight 101, as the aircraft was a military flight. Under Russian law, military flights are under the control of Russian military ATC, and permission or denial for approach and landing must be given by the controller prior to these actions being undertaken by a flight crew.[12] The final accident report determined that, because it was a foreign military aircraft, Russian controllers did not have the authority to issue military orders to Flight 101, and this had been communicated to the ATC personnel who handled the flight.[12] The &quot;trial&quot; approach was conducted with the understanding by ATC that all risk for such an approach was to be undertaken by Flight 101 and not ATC.[12]"/>
						<outline text="Theft from victims On 6 June 2010, it was reported that payments worth '¬1,400 had been made from a credit card found on the body of historian Andrzej PrzewoÅºnik, one of the victims of the crash. Credit cards belonging to the politician Aleksandra Natalli-Åwiat were also missing, but not used in transactions.[58] On 8 June 2010, ITAR-TASS reported that four soldiers of Unit 06755 had been charged in connection with the theft, after being found in possession of three credit cards used to withdraw a total of 60,345 roubles.[59] A Polish spokesperson said that the first withdrawals using the cards had been made around two hours after the crash.[60] The Polish government admitted that the Russian soldiers involved in the theft were probably conscripts, and that earlier reports blaming members of Russia's OMON forces for the theft had been a mistake.[61]"/>
						<outline text="Initial reports An initial report by CIS' Interstate Aviation Committee (Russian: Ð'ÐµÐ¶Ð&quot;Ð¾ÑÑÐ´Ð°ÑÑÑÐ²ÐµÐ½Ð½ÑÐ¹ Ð°Ð²Ð¸Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð¾Ð½Ð½ÑÐ¹ ÐºÐ¾Ð¼Ð¸ÑÐµÑ (MAK) ) revealed that all three engines were operating normally, and that there was no fire or explosion before the aircraft crashed.[62] According to the newspaper Dziennik, Polish flight recorder ATM-QAR registered that precisely at 8:41:02.5 (Polish time) the tail of the aircraft separated. All systems of Tu-154 stopped working at 8:41:04. Fuel temperature was below 0 °C (32 °F). Engines when the aircraft was above the road were at 60% of their nominal power (Tu-154 needs about 10 seconds to get 100% of power from engines). They also determined that the aircraft was 40 metres (130 ft) lower than it should have been.[63]"/>
						<outline text="The discrepancy among the time of the crash registered by MARS flight recorders (10:41:05.4), ATM-QAR recorder (10:41:04), and when electricity lines were cut by the crashing aircraft a second or two before the final crash (10:39:35) was never explained.[64]"/>
						<outline text="On 19 May 2010, the preliminary report of the investigation into the crash was published. Alexei Morozov, the head of the technical commission of Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee, stated that the Tupolev Tu-154M had no mechanical faults, and that an air traffic control official at Smolensk North Airport had &quot;warned twice that visibility was 400 metres (1,312ft) and that were no conditions for landing&quot;. The investigation ruled out a terrorist attack, explosion or fire on board the aircraft as the cause of the crash. It was also reported that the voices of two non-crew members were heard in the cockpit during the period leading up to the crash. One of the voices was identified by sources as the Polish Air Force Commander, Lieutenant General Andrzej BÅasik.[65][66] However, according to the findings of the Polish prosecutor's office in January 2013, General BÅasik had not stayed in the cockpit and was a regular passenger.[67] The other voice was later identified as the Director of Protocol.[12]"/>
						<outline text="According to the Interstate Aviation Committee report from 19 May 2010, the aircraft first hit an 11-metre (36 ft) tree approximately 1,100 metres (3,609 ft) from the runway. The aircraft was also off by 40 metres (130 ft) from the extended middle line of the runway. The TAWS alarm &quot;Pull up!&quot; was first sounded at 100 metres (328 ft)  altitude and then repeated several times before the crash. It was first sounded 18 seconds before hitting the tree and the crew attempted to abort landing 13 seconds later. Due to geographical relief the aircraft was actually 15 metres (49 ft)  below the runway at the time of the first impact.[68]"/>
						<outline text="On 26 May 2010, it was reported that pilot error had been identified as the reason for the crash.[citation needed ] Edmund Klich, the head of the Polish investigative commission, stated in an interview &quot;Pretty much everything is clear right now and nearly all evidence has been gathered&quot;. &quot;The pilots ignored the plane's automatic warnings and attempted an incredibly risky landing,&quot; Klich said.[citation needed ] According to the report, the crew of the Tupolev Tu-154M failed to respond for 13 seconds when the plane's &quot;terrain approaching&quot; alarm warned that the aircraft was less than 100 metres (330 ft) from the ground. The aircraft attempted to pull up after hitting a five-metre-tall (16 ft) birch tree, but part of the left wing had been sheared off in the impact. The aircraft then went into a roll before landing on its back and disintegrating five seconds later. Edmund Klich declined to speculate on whether the pilot had been placed under pressure to land, commenting, &quot;Psychologists will have to assess the stress levels the pilots were subjected to.&quot;[69]"/>
						<outline text="On 1 June 2010, Poland's Interior Ministry published a transcript from the cockpit voice recorder of the crashed Tu-154M.[citation needed ] The transcript confirmed earlier reports that the aircraft had attempted to land in bad weather against the advice of air traffic control and the plane's terrain awareness warning system.[70] At one point in the recording, Mariusz Kazana, the Director of Diplomatic Protocol in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, enters the cockpit and was told by the pilot &quot;Sir, the fog is increasing. At the moment, under these conditions that we have now, we will not manage to land&quot; to which Kazana replies &quot;Well, then we have a problem.&quot;[71]"/>
						<outline text="Expert commentators have noted that the flight navigator, who was listing the altitude readings on the transcript, was referring to the radar altimeter (which gives height above ground) rather than the pressure altimeter (which would provide the height relative to the level of the runway).[72] Because the terrain rises up to the runway, this could have had the effect of causing the pilot to fly far too low. The Final Report confirms this is exactly what happened.[12]"/>
						<outline text="The Russian report was published on 12 January 2011, and the Polish report was published on 29 July 2011. Both reports placed the majority of the blame for the accident on the pilots for descending too low without being able to see the ground. The Polish report also placed harsh criticism on the organization of Poland's special aviation regiment and its leaders, as well as finding deficiencies in the performance of the Russian air traffic controllers and in the airport's lighting and approach area. In Polish discourse, there remained wider questions and unease about the potential causes of the crash.[73] This prompted a Warsaw court and a separate military investigation. Some of the unease subsequently fueled conspiracy theories revolving around aspects of the investigation, such as Russia's decision not to return the Polish plane wreckage to Poland.[74]"/>
						<outline text="Russian final accident report The MAK completed their investigation on 20 October 2010. A copy of the report was sent to the Polish authorities, who had 60 days to comment, after which the report was published on 12 January 2011.[62]"/>
						<outline text="After the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) report's publication, Poland stated that it was created in violation of Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation because some requested documents and/or other evidence were not provided by Russia[49][75] and, according to a Polish lawyer, because Polish comments to the final report were not agreed to nor fully applied.[76]"/>
						<outline text="The final report noted that the captain's electronic altimeter was set 170 metres (560 ft) higher than the actual aeroplane position. This change was made after the aircraft began its final approach, and soon after the first TAWS warning sounded. All other altimeters on board were set correctly. The investigation also determined that the controller's radar screen was not calibrated correctly and showed the aeroplane as being 90''150 metres (300''490 ft) closer to the runway than it actually was. Additionally, his radio calls to the crew regarding their distance to the runway were given in advance by an average of 500 metres (1,600 ft).[clarification needed ][77]"/>
						<outline text="As part of their investigation, MAK conducted an experiment in a Tu-154M simulator to determine how late the crew could have gone around. &quot;The experiment confirmed that during approaches in conditions similar to the flight conditions of the T-154M ... with a similar flight profile with vertical speed of descent of 7''8 m/s ... the aircraft characteristics guaranteed safe go around from the height of 40 m (without taking into consideration the possible obstacles and terrain along the flight path).&quot;[12] Taking into consideration the terrain at Smolensk, the investigation determined the last moment a go-around manoeuvre would have been successful was coincident with the first officer calling &quot;Go around&quot; and briefly pulling the control column at 60 metres (200 ft).[12]"/>
						<outline text="On the same day that the final report was published by MAK, Poland published its comments on the draft of the final report sent to MAK before. Poland stated that their comments were not taken into consideration. MAK did not include them in the report, but published this document on its website among other appendixes.[77] Poland also published a final version of MAK report with changes performed by MAK in reaction for Polish comments highlighted (red colour means changes of text, blue means text addition).[12]"/>
						<outline text="The main points of Polish comments are:"/>
						<outline text="A list of documents, evidence, and other information requested by Poland but not received from the Russian side (First table in document &quot;Lista wystÄpieÅ strony polskiej o dokumentacjÄ&quot;, List of requests from Poland about documentation. Entry &quot;Nie otrzymano&quot; means &quot;Not received&quot;). Sample of them: Standards of certification for usage of military airports on the Russian Federation territory, Instructions for flights in Smolensk area.Poland notes that, according to international agreement between Poland and Russia from 1993, PLF101 was classified in Poland as a military plane and should be treated as performing a military operation also on the territory of the Russian Federation, especially in non-classified airspace and during approaching a military airport without ICAO certification. During military operations the ATC can give orders to the crew about landing decisions as opposed to civilian flights where the ATC only gives recommendations, but where the final decision about landing is the pilots' responsibility.Information that result of analysis of CVR (Cockpit Voice Recorder), performed by Polish Commission for the Investigation of National Aviation Accidents, says that first officer gives command &quot;go around&quot; at 100 m altitude[30][31] This analysis has been ignored by MAK's final report.[12]Request for document confirmation that Commander of the Landing Zone was allowed to work in bad weather conditions. Documents confirm only admission for work at day and night in normal weather conditions.  Poland notices also that Commander of the Landing Zone had never before worked at Smolensk and in last 12 months performed this function only 7 times. All that information is in his testimony. There is no documentation which certificate Commander of the Landing Zone on Smolensk airport which is required by Russian Law.Polish position that ATC gives wrong information for Flight 101 (&quot;on course, on glide slope&quot;) and &quot;Level 101&quot; was given too late. According to Final Report at this moment plane was up to 15''20 metres (49''66 ft) above runway level and 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) before runway begins.[12]Differences in approach card described by Final Report and approach card received by Poland before 10 April 2010 with information that Russia sent documents without information about reference system of coordinates in document. Poland assumed that coordinates are expressed using WGS-84 which is worldwide standard. Current standard for reference system used in Russia (according to its own law regulation) is PZ-90 which differ from WGS-84 by less than 40 cm (16 in) in any given direction.Doubts about Smolensk compliance with Russian regulations because there were trees and other obstacles in an area 300 to 900 m long before the runway. The heights of these obstacles are 15m higher than allowed (according to both Russian and ICAO regulations). After the accident, trees in this area were cut. The structure of flight PLF101 began to be destroyed[clarification needed ] in that area.[12]Polish explanation that there is no requirement in Military aviation for aircraft to have insurance (101 was owned and maintained by the Polish Military) and even civil regulations allows other financial protections besides insurance. In the case of Flight 101, the Polish National Treasury was financially responsible for the aircraft.Polish explanation that, according to Polish law, Certificate of Airworthiness is required for civilian planes and is not obligatory for military machines '-- instead of this certificate, Polish military planes have to accomplish conditions regulated by &quot;Instrukcja sÅuÅ¼by inÅ¼ynieryjno-lotniczej Lotnictwa SiÅ Zbrojnych RP&quot; (Instruction for engineering and aviation service of Aviation Forces in Republic of Poland). Poland also provides list of documents that confirm plane compliance with that document.Information that Polish side had not received documentation of control flight over Smolensk nor documentation of RSP-6m2 radar system used in ATC.Doubts about reliability of protocol after control flight which confirmed that light system (LUCZ-2MU) is working properly on Smolensk when MAK Final Report says it did not. Polish specialists were not allowed to be present during control flight.Doubts about proper work of radar display according to protocol from control flight.Request for source data to marker location on radar display described in Final Report. Information provided to Poland says that camera recorder in ATC was corrupted and there is no information about any other source data.Request for information about 13 recorders mounted in ATC, and data recorded (even corrupted) for analysis. MAK states that camera, voice recorders and photo laboratory did not work properly, and much information was not saved.Information that FCOM of Tu-154M in fact does not prescribe using the autopilot during non-precision approach, however this is also not forbidden.Expressed lack of any document that confirms Flight 101's status under Russian law.Request for source data and method of calculation of Flight 101's weight. Poland says that original documentation about loading and weight measure was destroyed.Allegations that documents certifying the medical examination of air controllers had manual corrections and are inconsistent with their testimonies where they confirmed that medical point was closed on 10 April 2010.Correction of number of specialists'--with list of their certifications'--that performed technical support on flight PLF101Polish publication of ATC tapes At an 18 January 2011 press conference, the Polish investigators made public the information contained in the ATC recordings, and their analysis thereof. They concluded that the &quot;on course, on glide path&quot; calls given to the pilots were made when the aircraft was actually off course, and furthermore the &quot;Level!&quot; call was given 11 seconds too late."/>
						<outline text="MAK publication of ATC tapes In response to the Polish claims of publicity MAK published transcripts of ATC recordings on its website.[79] The announcement made on MAK website states that the transcripts are based on a copy of recordings identical to the one which was given to the Polish side during the investigation."/>
						<outline text="The transcripts include: &quot;Open microphone&quot;,[80] phone calls[81] and radio transmissions.[82][better source needed ] The transcripts show that communication between the ATC and PLF101 was done mostly in Russian with only a few English phrases."/>
						<outline text="Causes MAK report The MAK report found the &quot;immediate cause&quot; of the accident was the failure of the crew to make a timely decision to proceed to an alternate airport despite being warned multiple times of the poor weather conditions at Smolensk.[12] Another immediate cause was the descent below minimums without visual contact with the ground as well as ignoring numerous TAWS warnings.[12] This led to controlled flight into terrain.[12] Additionally, the MAK report found an &quot;immediate cause&quot; of the accident was the presence in the cockpit of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Air Force, which placed extreme stress and &quot;psychological pressure&quot; on the Captain to &quot;continue descent in conditions of unjustified risk with a dominating aim of landing at any means.&quot;[12]"/>
						<outline text="A &quot;contributing factor&quot; to the accident was a long discussion with the Protocol director and the crew of the Yak-40 regarding the actual weather and the impossibility of landing at Smolensk in such weather conditions.[12] The report found this discussion caused the Captain to experience &quot;clash of motives.&quot;[12] On one hand he knew that landing in the reported weather conditions was unsafe.[12] On the other hand, he faced strong motivation to land at Smolensk anyway.[12] He expected a strong negative reaction from the President if he chose to divert the aeroplane and land at an alternate airport.[12]"/>
						<outline text="Other &quot;contributing factors&quot; were a lack of compliance with standard operating procedures, a lack of crew resource management, and a significant gap in bad weather flights by the PIC (he had not flown in weather conditions similar to Smolensk that day in four months).[12] Additional &quot;contributing factors&quot; were the Navigator calling out radar altitudes without considering the uneven terrain in the area, utilization of the autopilot and autothrottles much lower than minimum descent altitude which did not comply with the Flight Crew Operations Manual for the Tu-154, and the late start of the final descent which caused the crew to maintain a higher than normal vertical speed.[12]"/>
						<outline text="A &quot;systemic cause&quot; of the accident were &quot;significant shortcomings in the organization of flight operations, flight crew preparation and arrangement of the VIP flight in the special air regiment.&quot;[12]"/>
						<outline text="Official Polish government report The Polish Committee for Investigation of National Aviation Accidents (KBWLLP) published its report on 29 July 2011,[15] also available in English and Russian.[2][83] While the report stated that pilot error was the main cause of the accident, with the crew lacking adequate training in operating in adverse weather conditions, it differed from the Russian report in several aspects."/>
						<outline text="Chief among these differences was a conclusion that the pilots were not placed under pressure forcing them to land at Smolensk, and that the crew decided to abort landing when they reached 100m altitude (measured by radio altimeter) and had decided to go around using the autopilot.[2] However, it was impossible for the autopilot installed in the aircraft to conduct an automatic go-around from a non-precision approach.[2] The Polish investigation concluded this caused a delay in executing the go-around which contributed to the crash.[citation needed ]"/>
						<outline text="Another major difference was a conclusion that Russian air traffic control played a part in the accident by passing incorrect information to the crew regarding the plane's position. ATC gave distance callouts on average 500 metres (1,600 ft) in advance, and told the aircraft it was on the correct glidepath when it actually was not. Furthermore, the controllers gave the &quot;Level 101&quot; command ten seconds after the aircraft passed the 100 metres (330 ft) altitude where such call was supposed to be given.[2][84][85]"/>
						<outline text="The Polish report also found three deficiencies regarding the Smolensk airport which contributed to the crash. One was a large number of obstacles (mostly tall trees) in the area before the runway which should have been removed to keep the protected approach airspace clear of obstructions. The second deficiency was with the approach lighting system, which was charted incorrectly and not well maintained. Many bulbs were burned out, several others were missing their lenses, and others were obscured by shrubbery.[2] The third concern was with the airport information received by Poland, which contained incorrect information. In addition to the lighting system not being depicted correctly, the airport's location was charted approximately 116 metres (381 ft) to the North of its actual position.[2]"/>
						<outline text="Due to numerous accusations raised by Law and Justice opposition party who rejected the official report's conclusions, a new commission was created in 2013, headed by Maciej Lasek. Its task was to publish and explain all the technical evidence used in the official report. Lasek commission's produced over a hundred very detailed technical reports, maps, transcripts, photos and videos which were originally published on www.faktysmolensk.gov.pl website.[citation needed ] Shortly after the 2015 Polish parliamentary elections the website was shut down and all documents removed by the new government,[86] but were subsequently restored on an independent mirror.[82]"/>
						<outline text="Cause of accident according to Polish report:"/>
						<outline text="The immediate cause of the accident was the descent below the minimum descent altitude at an excessive rate of descent in weather conditions which prevented visual contact with the ground, as well as a delayed execution of the go-around procedure. Those circumstances led to an impact on a terrain obstacle resulting in separation of a part of the left wing with aileron and consequently to the loss of aircraft control and eventual ground impact.[2]Circumstances contributing to the accident:[2]"/>
						<outline text="Failure to monitor altitude by means of a pressure altimeter during a non-precision approach;failure by the crew to respond to the PULL UP warning generated by the TAWS;attempt to execute the go-around manoeuvre under the control of ABSU (automatic go-around);Approach Control confirming to the crew the correct position of the aeroplane in relation to the RWY threshold, glide slope, and course which might have affirmed the crew's belief that the approach was proceeding correctly although the aeroplane was actually outside the permissible deviation margin;failure by LZC to inform the crew about descending below the glide slope and delayed issuance of the level-out command;incorrect training of the Tu-154M flight crews in the 36 Regiment.Conducive circumstances:[2]"/>
						<outline text="incorrect coordination of the crew's work, which placed an excessive burden on the aircraft commander in the final phase of the flight;insufficient flight preparation of the crew;the crew's insufficient knowledge of the aeroplane's systems and their limitations;inadequate cross-monitoring among the crew members and failure to respond to the mistakes committed;crew composition inadequate for the task;ineffective immediate supervision of the 36 Regiment's flight training process by the Air Force Command;failure by the 36 Regiment to develop procedures governing the crew's actions in the event of:failure to meet the established approach criteria;using radio altimeter for establishing alarm altitude values for various types of approach;distribution of duties in a multi-crew flight.sporadic performance of flight support duties by LZC over the last 12 months, in particular under difficult WC, and lack of practical experience as LZC at the SMOLENSK NORTH airfield.Notable passengers In addition to KaczyÅski and his wife Maria, and Ryszard Kaczorowski, the last president of Poland in exile, on board were the military chiefs of staff (army, air force, navy), the national bank governor, a deputy foreign minister, head army chaplains of the Catholic and Orthodox churches, head of the National Security Bureau, three deputy parliament speakers, Olympic Committee head, the civil rights commissioner Janusz Kochanowski, trade union activist Anna Walentynowicz, and at least two presidential aides and widely known national lawmakers (including core members of the Law and Justice party).[87][88]"/>
						<outline text="Political aftermath In accordance with the Polish Constitution, on the president's death his duties were taken on by the marshal of the Sejm (speaker of the lower house of the parliament)'--at the time BronisÅaw Komorowski, who thus became acting president.[89] Within two weeks he was obliged to announce the date of the presidential election, to be held within a further 60 days on a weekend. KaczyÅski was up for re-election in late September or early October, before the end of his first five-year term.[90]"/>
						<outline text="Despite the deaths of the president and numerous officials, the crash was not expected to impair the functions of the government, since no cabinet ministers were aboard the plane. The Polish Armed Forces were dealt a severe blow, however, since all of their senior commanding officers were killed; their duties were automatically taken over by respective deputy commanders, following standard contingency plans for such a situation.[citation needed ]"/>
						<outline text="The commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre was split up because of the political conflict between the liberal-conservative government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk and national-conservative President KaczyÅski.[91] On 7 April, Tusk, along with government officials and members of his Civic Platform party, went to Katyn[92] on invitation from the prime minister of Russia, Vladimir Putin.[93] The official commemoration, organised by Polish Council for the Protection of Struggle and Martyrdom Sites, was scheduled on 10 April. Nevertheless, both ruling coalition and opposition were represented on the plane, with six and nine members of the Sejm, as well as one and two from the Senate, respectively, some of them well known in Poland.

						<outline text="Allegations of political assassination Conspiracy theories have been in circulation since the day of the accident, claiming in general that the crash was in fact a political assassination, an act of war against Poland or an elaborate coup attempt, possibly orchestrated by Russia.[169][170] The range of such theories has been described by some international media as &quot;dizzying&quot;; from the idea that the fog around the airport had been artificially produced, to victims' bodies being doctored in fake autopsies, to the idea that explosives were planted on board the plane.[170] Reports favourable to such conspiracy theories have in particular very often referred to an alleged detonation that happened immediately before the plane hit a birch tree."/>
						<outline text="Soon after the crash, Artur G&quot;rski, a Polish MP from the Law and Justice party, claimed that the Smolensk air traffic controllers were ordered to prevent the plane from landing, so that the president could not attend the KatyÅ ceremony, resulting in the crash. G&quot;rski later apologized for his remarks.[171] Law and Justice's leader JarosÅaw KaczyÅski and the head of the parliamentary committee of investigation Antoni Macierewicz have been described as long time supporters of the assassination theory, and have repeatedly accused the then prime minister Donald Tusk of being involved in a cover-up.[5][6][7] Macierewicz repeated these accusations as newly appointed minister of defence in 2016, causing a significant controversy in Polish, Russian and international media.[172]"/>
						<outline text="Claims of explosives traces On 30 October 2012, Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita reported that traces of explosives had been detected by investigators in the wreckage of the Tupolev, on the wings and in the cabin.[173] The claims were denied by Polish prosecutors'--who claimed that a number of common substances could as well have produced the observed readings[174]'--and were later withdrawn by the owner of the newspaper. Rzeczpospolita's editor-in-chief and three other staff, including the author of the article, were fired from their jobs.[note 1][175][176][177] The author of the article in question, Cezary Gmyz, maintained that what he wrote was confirmed by four independent sources.[178]"/>

						<outline text="Seremet said they had had the information for 10-20 days - about highly energetic molecules that can be used as an ingredient of explosives. He said he had personally informed Prime Minister Tusk about it. He said, thinking out loud, that maybe these were remnants of the war, that they would need to wait until the soil around the wreckage is sampled too, and that it was going to last a couple more months. Not a single time did he suggest that these molecules can point to another source than explosives - like perfume or a tent. Moreover, he added something that mattered to me - namely, that &quot;we knew that the information was going to leak out sooner or later&quot;, while looking at me inquisitively, and saying: &quot;We knew that some of the prosecutors decided to brag about these discoveries quickly. Because it leaked out of the prosecutor's office, didn't it?&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Tomasz Wr&quot;blewski, editor-in-chief of Rzeczpospolita[179]"/>
						<outline text="Seremet responded by claiming that he told the editor that the highly energetic particles[note 2] detected can be of &quot;various&quot; origin."/>
						<outline text="I said back then that I can confirm that during the inspection and examination of the wreckage in Smolensk, the experts' measuring instruments revealed the presence of some highly energetic materials, similar to explosives, but I said not to reach any conclusions, especially those equivalent to [conclusions] that such materials had been used against or towards that plane."/>

						<outline text="In November 2015, a court in Poland ruled in favour of the sacked journalists, stating that the information published in the article correctly reflected the state of knowledge at the time of publication.[180][181]"/>
						<outline text="After the 2012 publication, there was some discussion about the trustworthiness of the handheld explosives detectors used. The Supreme Military Prosecutor's Office (NPW) announced that they examined the interior of the other Polish government Tu-154M (the one that did not crash), and during the examination the handheld explosives detectors did, in some places, signal the presence of explosives - implying that the readings of the instruments in general cannot be trusted.[182][183] The manufacturer of the detector countered that the only way the detector can be fooled is when its benchmark (an element containing trace amounts of explosives, for reference) is clogged because of very high concentrations of specific substances in the surrounding air - for example, when put inside a bottle of acetone, or very close to a sample of perfume - which according to him is very unlikely to happen in the field; and even then it behaves in a way that would cause the user to notice the device is malfunctioning, because it alternates between different substances being reported instead of reporting just one of them. The results of an experiment conducted by some journalists seem to confirm that.[184]"/>
						<outline text="A relative of one of the victims brought back remains of the victim's clothing and a piece of seatbelt (including the clip) from Smolensk, and sent them to the United States for private examination. The examiners did not find traces of explosives on the piece of clothing. They did, however, find traces of TNT on the seatbelt.[185] The analysis was qualitative, stating that the substance was present but not determining its quantity."/>
						<outline text="In 2017, it was announced that the British Ministry of Defence was engaged by the Polish Government to examine the wreckage of the aircraft for traces of explosives. The work would be done by scientists based at the Forensic Explosives Laboratory at Fort Halstead, Kent.[186] In early 2019, Polish right-wing weekly Sieci reported that partial results from the Forensic Explosives Laboratory were in, and that the &quot;traces of explosives&quot; were confirmed in the &quot;vast majority&quot; of a few dozens of samples that had been tested by the British so far.[187][188] British air accident investigator Frank Taylor, who was involved in the investigation into the losses of Pan Am Flight 103 and British Airtours Flight 28M but did not investigate the Flight 101 crash apart from inspecting photographs presented by Antoni Macierewicz,[189] claimed that there were explosions on board the aircraft, including in its wing, immediately before it reached the tree.[190]"/>
						<outline text="According to Polish experts, trace amounts of high explosives could be present in the aeroplane due to frequent presence of military personnel onboard, or as result of contamination on the ground (Smolensk area was a battlefield during World War II). The fact that the traces were found on some parts of the aeroplane (e.g. belts) but not on others (e.g. bodies), their trace amounts and chemical character all have been described as inconsistent with the hypothesis of an in-flight bomb explosion.[191][192] The 2013 report of Maciej Lasek commission also did not corroborate the idea. For example, the bomb explosion theory is not supported by the fact that the plane's debris is concentrated in a relatively small 160x50 m area, and no parts of the plane's interior were found before the first ground contact.[193]"/>
						<outline text="Birch tree Smolensk birch tree with visible damage and Tu-154 fragmentsProponents of the assassination theory cast doubt on the probability of the Tu-154's left wing sustaining damage following its collision with a birch tree as described in the 2011 reports.[194][195][196] In some cases, critics of the official narrative have derisively characterised it as involving a collision with an &quot;armoured&quot; birch tree (Polish:Pancerna brzoza).[197][198] Members of the 2011 investigations have repeatedly stressed that the fact of the plane's left wing colliding with the birch tree is an obvious one, while photographs of the birch tree in question show it to have sustained considerable damage and to contain fragments of the Tu-154.[199][200] National Institute for Aviation Research simulations confirmed that the damage to the plane's left wing was consistent with a collision.[11] Even if the plane had avoided a collision with the birch tree and thus the subsequent uncommanded roll, the excessive angle of attack would have led to an aerodynamic stall approximately two seconds later which would also have led to a fatal accident.[12]"/>
						<outline text="Macierewicz-led reports Law and Justice parliamentary committee publications In July 2010, a group of Polish MPs, mostly from the Law and Justice party, formed the &quot;Parliamentary Committee for the investigation of the Tu-154M crash in Smolensk&quot;, chaired by the party's deputy leader Antoni Macierewicz. Later in November, Macierewicz called for the United States to lead an independent international commission on the accident. Some US Republican congressmen supported this idea but the U.S. has never acted upon it.[201]"/>
						<outline text="In March 2015 the Polish committee published a report in which it claimed that two separate explosions took place on board the Tupolev in the last few seconds of its flight, bringing the aircraft down; a third explosion allegedly occurred after the impact with the ground.[202] The committee's conclusions were partly based on a paper by WiesÅaw Binienda of the University of Akron, in which the author presented computer simulations that claimed to prove that the impact with the birch tree could not have severed the plane's wing.[203] The paper, however, was self-published and not peer-reviewed.[195][196] According to the committee's scientists '' Binienda, Kazimierz Nowaczyk from the University of Maryland[204] and Gregory SzuladziÅski[205] '' the direct cause of the crash was not a collision with an obstacle, but two explosions in the last phase of the flight: first on the left, by which the plane lost part of the left wing, then another inside the hull.[205] It was alleged that the official reports from 2011 contained contradictions, errors, and manipulations.[205][206] Binienda also claimed that if an accidental crash had occurred, then the cut wingtip could not have flown over 100 metres from the tree, the Tu-154's hull could not appear to have been torn from within, and there should have been a crater in the ground as a result of the crash.[195][196] Szuladzinski's report stated that any landing or fall in a wooded area, regardless of its adversity or its angle, could not in any way result in such fragmentation of the Tu-154 as was documented.[194] Nowaczyk analyzed data from FMS and TAWS system and came to the conclusions that the plane flew over the tree and was torn at a height over 30 metres above the ground.[196][207][208] WacÅaw BerczyÅski, a former software engineer at Boeing,[209][210] pointed to the pulled-out rivets of the hull sheeting and claimed that this could only have been caused by an internal explosion.[211]"/>
						<outline text="Starting in October 2012, an independent (financed by its participants) Smolensk Conference[212][213] was organised annually in Warsaw and attended by scientists and researchers from Polish and foreign universities to provide a forum intended to introduce and discuss independent studies related to the catastrophe.[214][215] The last (fourth) of these meetings was convened in November 2015 and its proceedings[216] (with summaries[217] and abstracts[218] in several languages) were published in 2016 (with a letter from the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda).

						<outline text="Subcommittee for the Re-investigation of the Smolensk Air Crash Following Law and Justice's victory at the 2015 Polish parliamentary elections, the newly conservative government appointed the chair of the Polish Parliamentary Committee of Investigation, Antoni Macierewicz, as defence minister, and the question of the Smolensk crash was brought back into the government's agenda.[86] New foreign minister Witold Waszczykowski announced that Poland would sue Russia in a human rights court over Moscow's withholding of the wreckage.[219] The Consul of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly designated a special investigation rapporteur who will carry out an inquiry on whether holding back the wreckage and other evidence material by the Russians is justified.[220]"/>
						<outline text="On 25 November 2015, government spokeswoman ElÅ¼bieta Witek called for former Prime Minister Donald Tusk to be put on trial for his handling of the 2010 air disaster.[221] Adam LipiÅski, from the Prime Minister's Chancellery, accused Tusk of negligence and weakness in handling the investigation and the restitution of the wreckage.[222] Deputy Minister of Culture JarosÅaw Sellin stated his absolute conviction that there were explosions on board the Tu-154 and that the real cause of the Smolensk crash had not yet been established.[223] Polish President Andrzej Duda, from the Law and Justice party, wrote a letter to the participants of the 4th Smolensk Conference that took place on 14 November 2015 in Warsaw, describing the official Russian and Polish accident reports as 'simply hypotheses' inconsistent with evidence, and stating that the investigation on the crash is not complete.[224][225]"/>
						<outline text="In November 2015, the government shut down the faktysmolensk.gov.pl website, which had been set up by state authorities under Tusk's cabinet to explain in simple terms the findings of the official investigations. No reason was given for the website closure.[86] An independent mirror was created shortly afterwards.[82]"/>
						<outline text="In February 2016, Macierewicz announced the official reopening of the investigation in the so-called Subcommittee for the Re-investigation of the Smolensk Air Crash (Polish: Podkomisja do spraw Ponownego Zbadania Wypadku Lotniczego), declaring that the previous inquiries were &quot;riddled with mistakes&quot; and reaffirming his belief that the aircraft disintegrated mid-air immediately before impacting the ground.[226] As part of the renewed investigation, the remains of the deceased Polish president were exhumed on 14 November 2016.[227]"/>
						<outline text="In January 2018, the Subcommittee claimed that a number of explosions had occurred aboard the airliner, with these claims being formalised during the presentation of their preliminary findings in February. The head of the previous commission, Maciej Lasek, dismissed the claims as &quot;illusions&quot; and &quot;propaganda&quot;.[228] In April 2018, the Subcommittee published a further report which said that the plane was destroyed in a mid-air explosion, and that Russian air traffic controllers at the Smolensk air base had misled the pilots about the plane's location during its approach to the runway; this report was described as one focusing on technical issues, with Macierewicz stating that the final report was yet to be published.[229]"/>
						<outline text="In June 2021 a ruling was delivered in a long trial where officials were accused of negligence in the flight's preparation. The judge stated that there were four parties directly involved in the flight preparation: the President's Office (KP), the Prime Minister's Office (KPRM), the Government Protection Office (BOR) and the 36th Special Aviation Regiment, with each of these having broken numerous procedural safeguards which would have prevented the crash. The President's Office should not have requested flight to an airport that was legally closed and not ready to accept such flights, the Prime Minister's Office should have not accepted and proceeded with the President's requests as it was not compliant with existing laws and procedures, and similar negligence was shown in the actions of the remaining two parties.[230]"/>
						<outline text="The date of publication of the Subcommittee's final report had been repeatedly delayed since 2016, with these delays generating a significant amount of frustration and criticism even among its members. Glenn Jorgensen, Marek DÄbrowski, WiesÅaw Chrzanowski and Kazimierz Grono were eventually removed from the Subcommittee and published a statement in which they rejected the conclusions of the report and their authorship.[231] Law and Justice MEP Beata Gosiewska, who had unsuccessfully requested a written version of the final report from Macierewicz, accused him of turning the investigation into an object of ridicule and of exploiting the disaster to advance his political career.[232] In February 2021, Civic Platform senator Krzysztof Brejza made a request to the Polish Ministry of National Defence for information on how much the Subcommittee's efforts had cost; the Ministry did not furnish Brejza with these figures, leading him to bring a legal case which, in September, he ultimately won. In December, following Brejza's receipt of the information that he had requested, it was reported that around 22.63 million zlotys had been spent by the Subcommittee between its 2016 inception and February 2021 despite the continued absence of the final report; in comparison, around 6.11 million zlotys had been spent between the immediate aftermath of the crash in 2010 and the publication of the 2011 reports.[233]"/>
						<outline text="In April 2022, JarosÅaw KaczyÅski stated that he had seen investigative documents in his capacity as a relative of a victim, with these documents supposedly confirming that the crash was induced deliberately; he went on to claim that the decision to bring down the plane was made &quot;at the highest level of the Kremlin&quot; and that the Polish government of the day covered up the truth of the matter as part of a &quot;macabre reconciliation&quot; with Russia. Conversely, Civic Coalition Sejm member Barbara Nowacka, whose mother Izabela Jaruga-Nowacka died in the crash, claimed that, while the documents did describe the crash as deliberate, they only did so because the investigation was politicised and had &quot;very little to do with the real evidence&quot;. Nowacka also accused Law and Justice of conducting a &quot;political war on the coffins of our loved ones&quot; and of attempting to divide Poland over &quot;our common tragedy&quot;.[8] On the twelfth anniversary of the Smolensk disaster, 10 April 2022, both Macierewicz and KaczyÅski alluded to the imminent publication of the Subcommittee's final report whilst again painting the crash as a deliberate act.[234][235] The report was subsequently published the following day and essentially repeated earlier allegations that the plane was destroyed by explosives as part of a Russian assassination plot; the report's publication was marked by a press conference where Macierewicz described the events in Smolensk as constituting an act of unlawful interference by Russia.[9][10] The report and its corresponding webpage were temporarily retracted when it was reported that imagery of victims' corpses had been included in the report without distressing aspects of those images being redacted; Macierewicz subsequently issued an apology to the victims' families and to any private individuals who had seen the images.[236][237] The images originally formed part of classified addenda from 2016 that discussed the burns on the victims' bodies; the author of the addendum, Marek DÄbrowski, said that his work had been retracted about a year before over disagreements with the Subcommittee's work and was therefore used without his consent, and that he did not want to be associated with the actions of Macierewicz.[237] It was also reported that other parts of the report, which was eventually republished on the domain belonging to the publisher of niezalezna.pl, a right-wing daily, were poorly redacted and the shaded text could be quickly uncovered using conventional software.[238]"/>
						<outline text="Shortly after the report's publication, the director of the Interdisciplinary Modelling Centre of the University of Warsaw (Polish: Interdyscyplinarne Centrum Modelowania Matematycznego i Komputerowego UW, ICM) to whose &quot;mathematical modelling&quot; results the report referred on a number of subjects declared that the ICM had never participated in the work of the Subcommittee and its computing resources had been used on a commercial basis for computations he described as pseudo-scientific.[239]"/>
						<outline text="In September 2022 TVN24 journalist Piotr Åwierczek published an extensive investigation, including interviews with members of the Subcommittee and external experts, documenting numerous cases where Macierewicz manipulated their results or reports of external laboratories, and came up with conclusions which were inconsistent or contradictory to the expert assessment of the evidence. For example, the American National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR) was hired to test whether the wing of a Tu-154 could break off upon impact with a birch tree as was reported to have happened during the disaster. The simulated collision saw the wing breaking off the plane upon impact in similar fashion to the findings of the 2011 reports. The NIAR's conclusions were completely ignored by Macierewicz and then misrepresented to prove the opposite case, namely that the wing cut through the tree without significant damage. Similar manipulations were applied to the pyrotechnical simulations of the wing, where a redacted photo was presented to fit the hypothesis that the wing suffered an internal explosion. Voice recorder analysis was interpreted by the Subcommittee in complete contradiction to the conclusion of a voice analysis expert who did not confirm that any explosions could be heard.[11] The Subcommittee responded by insisting on the accuracy of the new report's version of events and by accusing TVN24 of committing its own manipulations and presenting Russia's point of view; in contrast, Donald Tusk, who now served as leader of the Civic Platform, called for Macierewicz to be tried and imprisoned in connection with the reported manipulations.[240] JarosÅaw KaczyÅski denounced critics of the Subcommittee's report as being &quot;agents of [Vladimir] Putin&quot; during a Sejm debate on TVN24's findings,[241] and would later use a press conference to make similar comments about there being a &quot;powerful front&quot; defending Putin; KaczyÅski also claimed that the NIAR report would be published, but did not offer any specific timeframe for this to happen.[242][243] On 4 December, a further report from TVN24 stated that the National Public Prosecutor's Office had asked several international experts to examine the bodies of eighty-three Smolensk victims, with these examinations failing to find any evidence that the victims' injuries were caused by an explosion. The experts' opinion was submitted to the Prosecutor's Office on 20 September, but the latter had yet to reach a decision on public dissemination at the time of TVN24's report.[244][245][246]"/>
						<outline text="On 1 December 2022, Law and Justice attempted to amend a planned Sejm resolution on recognising Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism in order to include a section describing Russia as being &quot;directly responsible&quot; for the Smolensk crash and for the 2014 shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. All members of the opposition refused to vote on the amendment, depriving it of the required quorum; the resolution itself failed to pass after ElÅ¼bieta Witek, a Law and Justice member of the Sejm who currently serves as its Marshal, refused to allow a vote on the earlier, unamended version. Borys Budka, leader of the Civic Coalition's Sejm caucus, accused Macierewicz of &quot;still trying to impose his lies&quot; about the crash and asked if he and KaczyÅski were attempting to provoke a war with Russia; in turn, Macierewicz accused the opposition of being a &quot;pro-Russian formation&quot; unwilling to tell the truth about &quot;Russian terrorism&quot;.[247][248] On 14 December, a second attempt to pass the resolution was also boycotted since it again included an amendment attributing direct responsibility for the Smolensk crash to Russia; on this occasion however, the resolution was successfully passed, with Macierewicz thanking supporting Sejm members for making &quot;a great decision that [broke] the previous Smolensk lies&quot;.[249]"/>
						<outline text="In response to the September 2022 TVN24 report, entitled SiÅa KÅamstwa (The Power of Lies) in its broadcast version, Macierewicz submitted a complaint to the National Broadcasting Council where he accused the station of broadcasting &quot;the Russian point of view&quot; and misleading public opinion. On 30 December 2022, the head of the Council announced the launch of proceedings against TVN to determine if it had broadcast &quot;false information contrary to the Polish raison d'(C)tat and threatening public security&quot;, thereby being in breach of its broadcast licence. TVN responded by accusing the Council of trying to clamp down on journalistic criticism of the Commission, and proceeded to make The Power of Lies available for free on its Czarno na biaÅym YouTube channel. In January 2023, after TVN had decided to widen distribution of the original TVN24 report to any media outlet expressing interest, Onet, Gazeta Wyborcza, Wirtualna Polska, RMF FM, Radio ZET, and other outlets republished the report in a show of solidarity with the station.[250][251]"/>
						<outline text="In April 2023, at a speech marking the thirteenth anniversary of the crash, JarosÅaw KaczyÅski announced that Polish prosecutors would soon be asked to investigate it as a deliberate assassination and also suggested that Vladimir Putin should appear in the International Criminal Court in connection with the crash. KaczyÅski also accused the wider world of wanting either to believe &quot;nonsense stories&quot; about the crash being an accident or to forget about it entirely, and stated that fully explaining &quot;the Smolensk crime, but also [...] the Smolensk coverup&quot; and punishing the supposed perpetrators of both acts was &quot;one of the conditions for [Poland's] final victory&quot; and that &quot;every reasonable person knows [it was an assassination]... We have to convince the rest of our nation&quot;. The speech was condemned by opposition figures such as RadosÅaw Sikorski and  Mariusz Witczak as a further attempt to exploit the crash for political purposes and as &quot;soulless cynicism&quot;. Antoni Macierewicz later used a Polish Press Agency interview to confirm that his committee was preparing a request to prosecutors.[4]"/>
						<outline text="Opinion polls and foreign reaction In general, the assassination theory did not find much support among the general population of Poland. Since 2012, support for the notion that the Smolensk disaster was in fact an assassination generally oscillated between one-fourth to one-third of Poles.[5][7][172][252][8] Belief in the theory is stronger among supporters of the Law and Justice party and its allies - during the 2020 Polish presidential election for example, 56% of those who voted for the Law and Justice-supported Andrzej Duda believed in the theory, while support for it among those who voted for other candidates was in the single or low-double digits.[252][253][8] Support for the assassination theory surged during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, with an April 2022 poll conducted on behalf of wPolityce, a right-wing pro-government magazine, finding that 48% thought the assassination theory was plausible and 33% did not, with the remaining 19% being undecided.[254] An Ipsos poll for OKO.press in May 2022 found that 52% believed that the crash was an accident, 36% believed that it was caused by a deliberate attack, with this figure including 78% of those who identified themselves as Law and Justice supporters, and the remaining 12% were undecided.[4]"/>
						<outline text="The assassination theory did not gain significant traction outside of Poland prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with foreign outlets generally describing the claim as a conspiracy theory[6][7] or an allegation,[172][9][10] while Russia has consistently denied any involvement in the crash.[172] Following the first weeks of the invasion, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to give credence to the theory in his March 2022 address to the Polish Sejm, speaking of the &quot;silence of those who knew exactly everything but still looked constantly at our neighbour [Russia]&quot;.[255][256] During his April 2023 state visit to Poland, Zelenskyy referred to the Smolensk crash along with the Bykivnia graves, the Bucha massacre, and the Katyn massacre as atrocities that Russia would bear responsibility for.[257][258] Similarly, Ruslan Stefanchuk, Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, voiced a &quot;personal conviction&quot; that Russia was involved in the crash when interviewed by TVP Info in December 2022.[259] Former Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko also stated a belief in Russia being responsible for the crash during a January 2023 interview.[260][261] In an April 2023 Facebook post, former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili also claimed that Russia caused the crash, adding that it was intended as an act of revenge against Lech Kaczynski's visit to Tbilisi during the 2008 Russo-Georgian War.[262]"/>

						<outline text="Published : 16:20,   16 Oct 2023   Updated : 16:51,   16 Oct 2023 A FAT-busting jab hailed as the 'King Kong' of obesity treatments has been shown to help people shed a quarter of their body weight."/>
						<outline text="Tirzepatide - sold under the brand name is Mounjaro - was originally developed to treat diabetes and was approved for use in diabetic NHS patients earlier this month."/>
						<outline text="1"/>
						<outline text="Tirzepatide - brand name Moujaro - is licenced to treat diabetes but Eli Lily hopes to market it as a weight loss jab  Credit: ReutersBut its manufacturer Eli Lily is now looking to get the drug approved for obesity and weight loss management."/>
						<outline text="Tirzepatide follows in the footsteps of Ozempic - a once-weekly diabetes jab which was later green-lit for weight loss treatment under the brand name Wegovy."/>
						<outline text="Now, experts say tirzepatide is even more effective as a weight loss tool than its predecessors, causing users to lose 24 per cent of their body weight on average during an 84-week trial."/>
						<outline text="Like Wegovy and Ozempic - which contain the ingredient semaglutide - tirzepatide does cause some side effects, including nausea, diarrhoea, constipation and vomiting."/>
						<outline text="Eighty per cent of people participating in the most recent study reported experiencing at least one of those while taking tirzepatide."/>
						<outline text="But experts reckon it still causes fewer, less frequent and less intense symptoms compared to semaglutide."/>
						<outline text="On top of that, patients taking the drug shed more weight than people taking Wegovy or Ozempic in comparable studies."/>
						<outline text="They lost an average of 64lbs - about 29kg - achieving similar results to surgical interventions like gastric sleeve surgery, according to researchers."/>
						<outline text="Prior to presenting the results at Obesity Week conference taking place in Dallas, Texas, lead author and professor of psychology in psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Thomas Wadden, said: &quot;Patients who received lifestyle intervention and tirzepatide achieved a mean weight loss consistent with that produced by sleeve gastrectomy, a widely used procedure in metabolic and bariatric surgery."/>
						<outline text="&quot;Tirzepatide could offer a safe and highly effective alternative to surgery for some persons with severe obesity.&quot;  "/>
						<outline text="The study echoes previous research, which has found that tirzepatide helped patients lose 5kg more than semaglutide."/>
						<outline text="Leading US expert Dr Julio Rosenstock dubbed the drug the &quot;King Kong&quot; of obesity treatments, compared to the 'gorilla' of semaglutide, the Wall Street Journal reported."/>
						<outline text="How the study worked Published in the journal Nature Medicine, the study followed 576 adults struggling with obesity, who had already lost about 6.9 per cent of their body weight through an intensive 12-week lifestyle switch-up that included diet changes and exercise."/>
						<outline text="A once-weekly dose of tirzepatide was then given to 287 of those, while the remaining participants received placebo jabs."/>
						<outline text="Those taking the drug lost an 18.4 per cent of their body weight."/>
						<outline text="In comparison, those taking the dummy shot gained back 2.5 per cent of their weight."/>
						<outline text="Dr Wadden said: &quot;These are extraordinary findings."/>
						<outline text="''The additional weight loss produced further improvements, compared with placebo, in multiple measures of health, including waist circumference, blood pressure, cholesterol and triglycerides, blood sugar and physical functioning,&quot; he added."/>
						<outline text="How tirzepatide works Tirzepatide is a type of medication known as a GLP-1 agonist."/>
						<outline text="It mimics a naturally-occurring hormone in the body called a peptide to influence a specific hormone receptors linked to feelings of hunger and fullness."/>
						<outline text="It also helps to regulate insulin by mimicking a hormone called GIP."/>

						<outline text="(AP) '-- The medicine in the diabetes drug Mounjaro helped people with obesity or who are overweight lose at least a quarter of their body weight, or about 60 pounds on average when combined with intensive diet and exercise, a new study shows."/>
						<outline text="By comparison, a group of people who also dieted and exercised, but then received dummy shots, lost weight initially but then regained some, researchers reported Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine."/>
						<outline text="''This study says that if you lose weight before you start the drug, you can then add a lot more weight loss after,'' said Dr. Thomas Wadden, a University of Pennsylvania obesity researcher and psychology professor who led the study."/>
						<outline text="The results, which were also presented Sunday at a medical conference, confirm that the drug made by Eli Lilly &amp;amp; Co. has the potential to be one of the most powerful medical treatments for obesity to date, outside experts said."/>
						<outline text="''Any way you slice it, it's a quarter of your total body weight,'' said Dr. Caroline Apovian, who treats obesity at Brigham and Women's Hospital and wasn't involved in the study."/>
						<outline text="The injected drug, tirzepatide, was approved in the U.S. in May 2022 to treat diabetes. Sold as Mounjaro, it has been used ''off-label'' to treat obesity, joining a frenzy of demand for diabetes and weight-loss medications including Ozempic and Wegovy, made by Novo Nordisk."/>
						<outline text="All the drugs, which carry retail price tags of $900 a month or more, have been in shortage for months."/>
						<outline text="Tirzepatide targets two hormones that kick in after people eat to regulate appetite and the feeling of fullness communicated between the gut and the brain. Semaglutide, the drug used in Ozempic and Wegovy, targets one of those hormones."/>
						<outline text="The new study, which was funded by Eli Lilly, enrolled about 800 people who had obesity or were overweight with a weight-related health complication '-- but not diabetes. On average, study participants weighed about 241 pounds (109.5 kilograms) to start and had a body-mass index '-- a common measure of obesity '-- of about 38."/>
						<outline text="After three months of intensive diet and exercise, more than 200 participants left the trial, either because they failed to lose enough weight or for other reasons. The remaining nearly 600 people were randomized to receive tirzepatide or a placebo via weekly injections for about 16 months. Nearly 500 people completed the study."/>
						<outline text="Participants in both groups lost about 7% of their body weight, or almost 17 pounds (8 kilograms), during the diet-and-exercise phase. Those who received the drug went on to lose an additional 18.4% of initial body weight, or about 44 pounds (20 kilograms) more, on average. Those who received the dummy shots regained about 2.5% of their initial weight, or 6 pounds (2.7 kilograms)."/>
						<outline text="Overall, about 88% of those taking tirzepatide lost 5% or more of their body weight during the trial, compared with almost 17% of those taking placebo. Nearly 29% of those taking the drug lost at least a quarter of their body weight, compared with just over 1% of those taking placebo."/>
						<outline text="That's higher than the results for semaglutide and similar to the results seen with bariatric surgery, said Apovian."/>
						<outline text="''We're doing a medical gastric bypass,'' she said."/>
						<outline text="Side effects including nausea, diarrhea and constipation were reported more frequently in people taking the drug than those taking the placebo. They were mostly mild to moderate and occurred primarily as the dose of the drug was escalated, the study found. More than 10% of those taking the drug discontinued the study because of side effects, compared with about 2% of those on placebo."/>
						<outline text="Lilly is expected to publish the results soon of another study that the firm says shows similar high rates of weight loss. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted the company a fast-track review of the drug to treat obesity, which Eli Lilly may sell under a different brand name. A decision is expected by the end of the year."/>

						<outline text="Shikma Bressler at a protest in Tel Aviv, September 9, 2023.Shikma Schwartzman-Bressler, physicist and researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science, and a top co-leader of the anarchist coup attempt, told the audience at the First Nahalal Conference on Democracy: ''President Yitzhak Herzog has been sabotaging the protest for months to save Netanyahu, even if the intentions are good. It is forbidden to talk to Nazis, whether they are Jews or non-Jews.''"/>
						<outline text="In other words, according to Bressler, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his supporters are Jewish Nazis, and therefore any negotiations with him are verboten."/>
						<outline text="Remember Dany Dayan, Benny Gantz's appointment to CEO of Yad Vashem? Dayan has been under a magnifying glass for irregularities at his institution which is dedicated to the memory of the Holocaust. You would have expected Dany Dayan to issue an angry condemnation of this outrageous public statement. He didn't. No one else on the left did, either. It has become commonplace for Israeli leftists to call the right fascists and Nazis with no fear of consequences. As if this is an established truth that requires no supporting evidence. And so, Justice Minister Yariv Levin is a fascist for wishing to restore balance to the three branches of government, and MK Simcha Rothman is a fascist for passing Levin's agenda through his Constitution committee, and Netanyahu is a fascist because, you know, he just is."/>
						<outline text="Last week, Haaretz interviewed General (Res.) Gil Regev, the former head of the IDF HR, who openly called for a military coup against the prime minister. ''The Chief of Staff, the head of the Shin Bet, and the head of the Mossad should tell Bibi, up to here.'' He continued: ''They should tell him that if this government does not go back from the direction it took '... there will be no IDF.''"/>
						<outline text="The demonization of the right is no longer just tolerated, it is the formative image carried by the mainstream media of the ''Bibistim,'' Netanyahu's camp, which happens to comprise 64 mandates out of the Knesset's 120."/>
						<outline text="So, what did Dany Dayan have to say about the desecration of the memory of the Holocaust, the guardianship of which is in his job description? He shared his own late-August tweet that said: Recently, there has been an increase in the public discourse in Israel of terrible statements that make malicious use of the Holocaust and its Nazi perpetrators. There was a (right-wing) man who expressed satisfaction over the murder of millions of Jews, a pamphlet (right-wing) that blamed LGBT people for the Holocaust, and now a well-known professor (left-wing) who compares a Jewish leader to Hitler. I follow these phenomena with anxiety and disgust and call for them to stop immediately.''"/>

						<outline text="Yaniv Turgeman commented: ''Only one thing is more shocking than the disgrace Shikma Bressler uttered, and that's the fact that no one around the table interrupted her, no one in the audience made a comment. And the worst thing is that in addition, they applauded her. He also noted that Channel 12 News failed to report the Bressler Nazi fiasco."/>

						<outline text="Here's a bit of common gossip we have been avoiding recently, but decided to release seeing as Bressler is viewing the majority of Israelis as Nazis. Right-wing attorney Kinneret Broshi revealed that Bressler is married to a member of the clandestine Shin Bet, and noted: ''In recent months, many in Israel have been wondering how people protesting against the government arrive in a matter of minutes at places where the Prime Minister, senior ministers, and Knesset members are staying.''"/>

The Shin Bet's headquarters are located in northwest Tel Aviv, north of Yarkon Park."/>
						<outline text="It is one of three principal organizations of the Israeli intelligence community, alongside Aman (military intelligence) and Mossad (foreign intelligence service)."/>
						<outline text="Organization   [ edit ]  Shabak is believed to have three operational wings:[2]"/>
						<outline text="The Arab Department: responsible primarily for Arab-related counterterrorism activities in Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip.The Israel and Foreigners Department: formerly named the Non-Arab Affairs Department. It includes the Department for Counter-intelligence and Prevention of Subversion in the Jewish Sector, also known as the &quot;Jewish Department&quot;.[3] It is responsible for preventing espionage, and for dealing with extremists who carry out actions (such as terrorism) against the state and the democratic regime. As its original concerns mostly related to the Communist Bloc, it shrank after the fall of the Soviet Union, but rose again in importance in response to Jewish terrorist activity beginning in the early 1980s.[4]The Protective Security Department: responsible for protecting high-value individuals and locations in the country such as government officials, embassies, airports, and research facilities.Although a security agency, it is not a part of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, and its chief answers directly to the Prime Minister of Israel."/>
						<outline text="Duties and roles   [ edit ]  Shabak's duties are safeguarding state security, exposing terrorist rings, interrogating terror suspects, providing intelligence for counter-terrorism operations in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, counter-espionage, personal protection of senior public officials, securing important infrastructure and government buildings, and safeguarding Israeli airlines and overseas embassies."/>
						<outline text="History   [ edit ]  With the Israeli declaration of independence in 1948, the Shabak was founded as a branch of the Israel Defense Forces and was initially headed by Isser Harel (the father of Israeli Intelligence, who later headed the Mossad). Responsibility for Shabak activity was later moved from the IDF to the office of the prime minister. During the 1948 Arab''Israeli war, Shabak's responsibilities included only internal security affairs. In February 1949 (a short while before the end of the war), its responsibilities were extended to counter-espionage.[5]"/>
						<outline text="One of the Shabak's leading successes was obtaining a copy of the secret speech made by Nikita Khrushchev in 1956, in which he denounced Stalin. A Polish edition of the speech was provided to the Israeli embassy in Warsaw by the boyfriend of the secretary of a Polish communist official. The Shabak's Polish liaison officer conveyed the copy to Israel. The Israeli government then decided to share the information with the United States, which published it with Israeli approval.[6] On the other hand, a study published in 2013 by Matitiahu Mayzel casts doubt on the story, arguing that the speech was not secret and that it was conveyed to the West by multiple sources, including Soviet political and intelligence agencies.[7]"/>
						<outline text="A notable achievement in counter-espionage was the 1961 capture of Israel Beer, who was revealed to be a Soviet spy. Beer was a lieutenant colonel in the reserves, a senior security commentator and close friend of Ben-Gurion and reached high Israeli circles. Beer was tried and sentenced to ten years in prison (later extended by the Supreme Court to fifteen years, following his appeal), where he died. A year before, Kurt Sitte, a Christian German from the Sudetenland and a professor in the Technion, was revealed as a Czechoslovakian spy.[8]"/>
						<outline text="Medal given to Shabak workers on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel, 1988In 1967, an Egyptian-Israeli double agent, Rif'at al Gamal/Jacques Bitton, gave Egypt false information about Israel's battle plans, claiming it would begin with ground operations. The Egyptians thus left their aircraft on open runways, which enabled the Israel Air Force to knock out Egypt's air force within three hours of the outbreak of the Six-Day War.[9] Operation Yated, as it was later known, is considered one of the most successful deceptions in Israeli intelligence history, on a par with Britain's Operation Mincemeat during World War II.[9]"/>
						<outline text="After the war, monitoring terrorist activity in the West Bank and Gaza Strip became a major part of Shabak's mission. During 1984''1986, Shabak experienced a major crisis following the Kav 300 affair in which four Palestinian militants hijacked a bus. Two of the hijackers were killed in the ensuing standoff and the other two were killed shortly after being taken into custody by Shabak officers, who later covered up the event and conspired to frame a senior IDF officer.[10] Following the affair, Shabak head Avraham Shalom was forced to resign."/>
						<outline text="The 1987 Landau Commission, set up to investigate Shabak interrogation methods, criticized the organization and established guidelines to regulate what forms of physical pressure could be used on prisoners. Among the  practices authorised were  &quot;keeping prisoners in excruciatingly uncomfortable postures, covering their heads with filthy and malodorous sacks and depriving them of sleep.&quot; Human rights groups in Israel maintained that this amounts to torture.[11] A 1995 official report by Miriam Ben-Porat, made public in 2000, showed that Shin Bet &quot;routinely&quot; went beyond the &quot;moderate physical pressure&quot;  authorised  by the Landau Commission. In the report, Israel admitted for the first time that   Palestinian  detainees were  tortured during the First Intifada, between 1988 and 1992.[11]"/>
						<outline text="In 1995, the Shin Bet failed to protect the Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated by right-wing Israeli radical Yigal Amir. Shin Bet had discovered Amir's plans, and a Shin Bet agent was sent to monitor Amir, and reported that Amir was not a threat. Following the assassination, the Shabak director, Carmi Gillon, resigned preemptively. Later, the Shamgar Commission pointed to serious flaws in the personal security unit. Another source of embarrassment and criticism was the violent, provocative and inciting behavior of Avishai Raviv, an informer of the Shabak's Jewish Unit during the time leading up to the assassination.[12] Later, Raviv was acquitted of the charges that he encouraged Yigal Amir to kill Yitzhak Rabin."/>
						<outline text="A few months after the Rabin assassination, Hamas chief bombmaker Yahya Ayyash was assassinated in a targeted killing in which an explosive device was planted in his cellular phone.[13]"/>
						<outline text="Gillon was replaced by  Israeli Navy admiral Ami Ayalon, who helped to restore the organizational morale, after the debacle of the Rabin assassination, and to rehabilitate its public image.[14]"/>
						<outline text="In 2000, Ayalon was replaced by Avi Dichter,  an ex-Sayeret Matkal commando and experienced Shabak agent, who tightened the working relationship with the Israel Defense Forces and Israeli police. Dichter was in charge when the al-Aqsa Intifada erupted. He turned Shabak into a prominent player in the war on terrorism after the collapse of the 2000 Camp David Summit."/>
						<outline text="In November 2003, four former heads of Shabak (Avraham Shalom, Yaakov Peri, Carmi Gillon and Ami Ayalon) called upon the Government of Israel to reach a peace agreement with the Palestinians.[15]"/>
						<outline text="In May 2005, Dichter was replaced by Yuval Diskin, who served until 2011."/>
						<outline text="In 2007, the service launched its first-ever public recruitment drive, unveiling a &quot;slick Website&quot; and buying on-line ads in Israel and abroad in a campaign aimed at &quot;attract[ing] top-tier computer programmers&quot; to its &quot;cutting-edge&quot; IT division. On March 18, 2008, it was announced that Shabak's official website would also offer a blog, where four of its agents would discuss anonymously how they were recruited, and what sort of work they perform; they would also answer questions sent in by members of the public.[16] The decision to launch the blog was made by the Shin Bet's top brass, including head Yuval Diskin, and is part of an attempt to attract high-tech workers to the agency's growing IT department. According to Shabak officers, the Web site and blog are aimed also at promoting a more accessible and positive public image for the secret service, long associated with &quot;dark, undercover and even violent activity&quot;.[17]"/>
						<outline text="In 2011, Yoram Cohen was chosen as the new head of Shabak, and served until 2016."/>
						<outline text="In 2016, Nadav Argaman was chosen as the new head of Shabak, and assumed office on 8 May 2016."/>
						<outline text="On 11 October 2021, Ronen Bar was announced as the next head of the ISA,[18][19] and took office on 13 October.[20]"/>
						<outline text="On 16 October 2023, following the succesful surprise attacks by Hamas against Israel in Operation Al-Aqsa Flood and the subsequent outbreak of the 2023 Israel''Hamas war, ISA director Ronen Bar took responsisbility for his role in the failure of Israeli intelligence to predict the oncoming war from Gaza.[21][22]"/>
						<outline text="Accountability   [ edit ]  Former Shin Bet director special assistant Barak Ben-Zur said that since 1948 (or more particularly 1957) the group has been brought under the control of the Knesset in order to monitor its budget. In May 2002, Shin Bet was brought under the purview of the Knesset Foreign and Security Committee, which could investigate whether it is working within legal boundaries which, in turn, involves the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee. The government legal adviser approves Shin Bet activities while the Political-Security Cabinet receives reports directly from the Shin Bet director and ensures that every detainee has the right to submit a complaint.[23]"/>
						<outline text="Information gathering, interrogation methods and torture   [ edit ]  Shabak also extracts information by interrogating suspects, and there is a history of concern over its methods. In 1987, after complaints about excessive use of violence, the Landau Commission drew up guidelines condoning &quot;moderate physical pressure&quot; when necessary, but in 1994, State Comptroller Miriam Ben-Porat found that these regulations were violated and senior GSS commanders did not prevent it.[24]"/>
						<outline text="Later, in 1999, the Israeli Supreme Court heard several petitions against Shabak methods, including (1) &quot;forceful and repeated shaking of the suspect's upper torso, in a manner which causes the neck and head to swing rapidly,&quot; (2) manacling of the suspect in a painful &quot;Shabach position&quot; for a long period of time, (3) the &quot;frog crouch&quot; consisting of &quot;consecutive, periodical crouches on the tips of one's toes,&quot; and other methods. The Court ruled that Shabak did not have the authority, even under the defense of &quot;necessity,&quot; to employ such methods.[25] This ruling was hailed as landmark against using torture on Palestinian prisoners.[26]"/>
						<outline text="Shabak claims it now uses only psychological means, although B'Tselem and Amnesty International continue to accuse Shabak of employing physical methods that amount to torture under international conventions.[27][28][29][30] In 2015,  Physicians for Human Rights''Israel noted that petitions against Shin Bet had quadrupled since 2012, and claimed that over the past several years of 850 complaints against Shin Bet for torture none had yet been investigated. It further claimed that no system of legal redress against security organizations is in place.[31]"/>
						<outline text="Shabak has also worked closely with the Israeli Air Force in &quot;targeted killings&quot; of field commanders and senior leaders of Palestinian militant factions[32] of Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, and Fatah. These killings are usually done by helicopter gunships. Both the IAF commanders and Shabak agents sit together in the command center to monitor the operations. Shabak's task is to give intelligence about when and where the target will be available for a strike and then react to IAF drone feedback to ensure the men at the location are indeed the correct targets.[33]"/>
						<outline text="Detentions   [ edit ]  Salah Haj Yihyeh, a Palestinian who runs mobile clinics for Physicians for Human Rights, was detained for questioning by the Shin Bet.[dubious    '' discuss ] In the questioning, Yihyeh answered questions about the activities of the organization, its budget, the identity of its donors, and details about others employed by PHR. The board of Physicians for Human Rights, in a letter to Shin Bet chief Yuval Diskin, rejected the &quot;crossing of a red line in a democracy.&quot; The letter argued that since the only cause for calling an employee of the group was to scare him, the tactics were unacceptable and illegal.[34]"/>
						<outline text="Palestinian journalist Mohammed Omer was detained in July 2008 by Shin Bet. Having arrived on a flight from London, Omer says that he was taken aside by a Shin Bet official. According to Democracy Now!, Omer was later questioned, strip-searched, and then beaten by eight armed Shin Bet officers. Injuries from the ordeal allegedly left Mohammed Omer in the hospital for a week.[35] The Israeli government rejected Omer's claims outright, citing inconsistencies in his allegations and noting that such investigations are strictly regulated.[36][37]"/>
						<outline text="Shin Bet in popular culture   [ edit ]  In 2012, six former heads of the Shabak (Shalom, Peri, Gillon, Ayalon, Dichter, and Diskin) featured in a documentary film, The Gatekeepers, and discussed the main events of their tenures."/>

						<outline text="Nigeria is battling a diphtheria outbreak that has killed more than 600 people, most of them children, officials have said. Many of the infected minors were not vaccinated."/>
						<outline text="According to multiple reports on Thursday, there are now 14,000 suspected cases of the disease, double what the Nigeria Center for Disease Control and Prevention recorded last month."/>
						<outline text="The outbreak, which started last December, has affected 19 of the country's 36 states as well as the federal capital, Abuja. The epicenter is Kano state in northern Nigeria, where more than 500 deaths have been recorded. "/>
						<outline text="Diphtheria is highly contagious and affects the nose and throat. Symptoms typically emerge gradually, beginning with a sore throat and fever. "/>
						<outline text="In severe cases, the bacteria produce a toxin that causes a thick gray or white patch at the back of the throat that can block the airways."/>
						<outline text="Dr Faisal Shuaib, head of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, who visited a diphtheria isolation center in Kano city on Wednesday, said that it was disturbing that young children were suffering from an ''entirely preventable disease.''"/>
						<outline text="Shuaib added that measures including contact tracing have contributed to a decline in the number of cases."/>
						<outline text="The World Health Organization (WHO) has said inadequate testing and some patients not reporting their symptoms meant it was difficult to accurately track infection rates. "/>
						<outline text="The organization has stressed that immunization is the most effective way of managing the crisis, and has urged parents with unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children to visit their nearest health clinics. "/>
						<outline text="According to the WHO, only 57% of Nigerians have received the pentavalent vaccine, which protects against five life-threatening diseases, including diphtheria. It added that ''vaccine coverage of 80''85% must be maintained to ensure community protection.''"/>
						<outline text="The last significant diphtheria outbreak in Nigeria occurred in 2011, when 21 people lost their lives and 98 were infected in Borno state, the WHO reported. "/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="I was in shock. How could this be? I texted all my medicalized trans sisters on my way home and asked a simple question: ''Who makes your hormones?'' Many of them didn't know offhand. It takes a great deal of struggle and an intense amount of questioning for many trans folks to get their hands on this life-saving medication, and once we do, we want to start immediately and experience an end to questions regarding the validity of our identity and our choices. But my sisters heard the urgency in my call and checked in. As the responses came, every single one was either Teva, or a company that a quick Google search listed as linked to Teva."/>
						<outline text="How did this one Israeli company play such a large role in the cross-gender hormone market? How did my body once again find itself as a battleground, a settlement, an ongoing pawn in this Zionist game?"/>
						<outline text="I later got in touch with a Jewish, anti-Zionist trans student at Mills College, Daryn Copland, who reached out to me online. He told me that he had been dedicating the past year of his research to understanding the connections between cross-gender hormone production in the U.S. and in Israel. He told me that he too found out his testosterone was made by Teva and wanted to understand what we should do about it as trans folks who support the BDS movement."/>
						<outline text="This was no longer just about me feeling free in my body. A large part of the trans community in the U.S. is being forced to choose between our life-affirming transitions and our Palestinian siblings' demand for freedom."/>
						<outline text="After the necessary heartbreak of coming to terms with once again being complicit with the regime I so desperately want to dismantle, I found the power in having a platform to do something about it."/>
						<outline text="This is why Daryn and I are trying to start an open online resource that lists companies that are affiliated with Teva. We are hoping to find alternative manufacturers for our trans siblings while never neglecting the low price, high-demand needs of our community. Most importantly, I hope that all the trans, GNC, and queer folks reading this will help us make the message loud and clear '-- Zionism has tried to tie trans liberation to Palestinian oppression, but we refuse to accept this as our reality."/>

						<outline text="A new bill, introduced in both houses of Congress, would impose the first federal tax on vaping products and nicotine pouches. The bill's authors say it is intended to harmonize the tax rate on all consumer nicotine products based on their nicotine content, but in reality it would make vaping more expensive than smoking cigarettes."/>
						<outline text="Thirty-three states and federal territories currently have some kind of vape tax, and many have taxes on nicotine pouches. But there is currently no federal tax on tobacco-free nicotine products like vapes."/>
						<outline text="If passed, the Tobacco Tax Equity Act would add a federal tax of $100.66 per 1,810 milligrams of nicotine to all tobacco-free nicotine products. That's about 5.5 cents per milligram of nicotine. A consumer who vapes 50 mg/mL nicotine salt e-liquid would pay an extra $2.75 per mL of juice, or $82.50 for a 30 mL bottle'--on top of the normal product price and any state or local taxes."/>
						<outline text="The selling price of a 60 mL bottle of 12 mg/mL e-liquid would increase by about $40, and the law would add about $14 to the price of a 5 mL disposable vape. It would tax a single JUUL pod at a higher rate than a pack of cigarettes ($2.25 vs $2.00), and a package of 20 nicotine pouches would cost an additional $2.00. For DIY vape juice makers, a one-liter bottle of 100 mg/mL nicotine would be taxed at more than $5,000!"/>
						<outline text="The Consumer Advocates for Smoke-free Alternatives Association (CASAA) has issued a nationwide call to action, encouraging vapers and other nicotine consumers to contact their members of Congress to express opposition to the outrageous new tax proposal."/>
						<outline text="For DIY vape juice makers, a one-liter bottle of 100 mg/mL nicotine would be taxed at more than $5,000."/>
						<outline text="The Senate bill is S 2929, introduced by Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin'--a longtime vaping foe'--and co-sponsored by eight other Senate Democrats. The House version, HR 5715, was introduced by Illinois Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, also a Democrat who has been involved in many anti-vaping legislative efforts. Both bills were introduced Sept. 26."/>
						<outline text="A few days earlier, Durbin introduced the CARE for Moms Act, which also includes the new vape and tobacco tax proposals. Durbin, however, didn't mention the taxes in his press statements about the CARE for Moms Act."/>
						<outline text="Durbin has proposed many similar ''tax equity'' bills in previous Congressional sessions. Two years ago, the language from his Tobacco Tax Equity Act of 2021 was included in the Democrats' year-end spending bill until it was removed with days to spare by Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto."/>
						<outline text="The Tobacco Tax Equity Act of 2023 would also double the federal tax on cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco and small cigars, and increase the tax rates on moist snuff and pipe tobacco by as much as 2,000 percent. Moist snuff is demonstrably safer than any form of combusted tobacco."/>
						<outline text="In a press release touting the new bill, the authors bragged that the legislation is endorsed by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, American Lung Association, American Heart Association, the American Public Health Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, Trust for America's Health, and National Association of County and City Health Officials."/>
						<outline text="Smokers created vaping without help from the tobacco industry or anti-smoking crusaders, and I believe vapers have the right to continue innovating to help themselves. My goal is to provide clear, honest information about the challenges vaping faces from lawmakers, regulators, and brokers of disinformation. I'm a member of the CASAA board, but my opinions aren't necessarily CASAA's, and vice versa. You can find me on Twitter @whycherrywhy"/>
