1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,999
adam curry

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,999
john c divorce it's sunday may
17th 2020

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,999
this is your award-winning
kitmo nation

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,999
media assassination episode
1243.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:25,999
this is no agenda

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,999
and from northern silicon
valley i

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,999
believe adam's turned into a
democrat

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,999
i'm john cena buzzkill

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,999
in the morning yeah i figured
i'd try

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,999
and see how it works with the
mask

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,999
seeing as that

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,999
is what we're going to be
coerced into

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,999
no matter what

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,999
we want

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,999
well i've read these orders and
none of

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,999
them say you have to be wearing
a mask

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,999
all the time correct

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,999
you do not so why are people
wearing the

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,999
mask all the time they're
wearing him in

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,999
their car

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,999
i'm wearing him at home yeah
yeah i have

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,999
done some

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,999
investigative work on this and
um

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,999
unfortunately this is a result

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,999
of the i would say the

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,999
the society that we've created
certainly

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,999
younger people

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,999
and it goes like this

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,999
you have to wear a mask to keep

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,999
me safe okay

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,999
you have to wear the mask to
keep me

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,999
safe so if you're not wearing a
mask

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,999
but i'm wearing a mask i'm
keeping you

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,999
safe 

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,999
but you're a douchebag and

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,999
that's the bottom line you're
not going

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,999
to get away from it

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,999
people are mad they're angry

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,999
and i think that if we want to
just open

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,999
up i have a suggestion

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,999
it's completely optional so
wherever you

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,999
go a store

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,999
doesn't have to force you to
wear masks

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,999
but they can't and if they do

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,999
then you should will respect
that any

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,999
other place

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,999
where you want me to wear a
mask so that

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,999
you feel safe

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,999
is good i'll wear the mask and
to make

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,999
sure 

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,999
i feel safe and i'm protected
from you

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,999
i'm going to open carry my
firearm

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,999
and i'm going to do this in
texas

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,999
so that you can see i'm not a
democrat

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,999
democrats have guns open

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,999
carry no i don't think so in
austin

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,999
no double no not at all

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,999
a couple of things here i i i
question

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,999
your premise

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,999
and by that i mean i'm not
absolutely

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,999
sure 

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,999
that all these douchebags
wearing a mask

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,999
actually think that they're
wearing the

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,999
mask to protect

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,999
you from them no it's it's all
virtue

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,999
signaling but that is that's
what that's

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,999
the 

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,999
the reasoning that's given
that's the

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,999
rationale it's not even really
true well

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,999
then why is somebody wearing
the mask in

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,999
their car

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,999
well that's okay if they want
to feel

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,999
that that's their business i
don't care

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,999
if they want to look like
idiots but i'd

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,999
like to get away from

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,999
this we're never going to open
up fully

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,999
until we agree on some social
things and

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,999
if it's going to be masks oh my
god so

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,999
be it

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,999
go ahead force everybody to
wear a mask

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,999
that's we need to do something
and i'm

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,999
willing to compromise but again
i'm

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,999
going to open carry which is
legal as

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,999
long as you have your concealed
carry in

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,999
texas you can open carry and i

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,999
intend to do that in my car too
and on

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,999
the street

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,999
yeah yeah it's you know there's
i don't

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,999
think there's any other

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,999
way for us to go so you don't
have do

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,999
you have a holster yet

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,999
oh i have several holsters um
in italy

93
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,999
they're opening up on tuesday
and uh

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,999
they will have social
distancing i've

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,999
got a little report from willow

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,999
so they'll have all that set
but masks

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,999
shall be worn until there's a
cure or a

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,999
vaccine so

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,999
i'm seeing what's going on
we're not

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,999
going to get away from this
it's going

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:07,999
to be an

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,999
endless fight with a whole
bunch of

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,999
idiots and we just have to
become japan

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,999
we're already on our way
financially

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,999
into the japanese

106
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,999
debt trap so we might as well
just go

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,999
the full nine yards

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,999
i don't see it it's not worth
it from

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,999
our duke and duchess or the
duke anyway

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,999
would you i don't know if you
have it

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,999
well i'd like to read it during
the

112
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,999
donation segment but i have some

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,999
it's kind of just i think i
really might

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,999
want to read it now this is
really

115
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,999
exactly what you're talking all
right

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,999
all right well okay

117
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,999
i have a report from china as
well uh

118
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,999
this is from sir mark and dame
astrid

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,999
the duke and duchess of japan
and all

120
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,999
the disputed islands in the
japan sea

121
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,999
and uh we will read uh most of
this

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,999
on uh during the donation
segment but uh

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,999
masks work

124
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,999
is the japanese uh reasoning

125
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,999
and the whole country wears
them for flu

126
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,999
season every year especially on
the most

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,999
crowded mass transit system in
the world

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,999
he gives us some

129
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,999
numbers they've only had 739
deaths for

130
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,999
a population of 126 million

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,999
which is very good uh complete
so that's

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,999
uh what did what do you put
here that's

133
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,999
like uh

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,999
it's like 10 times less than
united

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,999
states if you believe the
numbers of

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:21,999
course 

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,999
yeah then well there you go
well hold on

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,999
hold on we'll go

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,999
we'll get there mass usage went
up with

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,999
covid but it also meant that it
was the

141
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,999
weakest flu season in over 10
years

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,999
interestingly uh not the same
here in

143
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,999
fact the mortality rate in
japan from

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,999
march was also down on top of
this if

145
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,999
you feel you have symptoms

146
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,999
and this i think is kind of
cool japan

147
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,999
is doing you're asked to go to
one of

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,999
the many hotels

149
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,999
that have been commandeered for

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,999
isolation hub so you don't go
to the

151
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,999
hospital and infect everybody

152
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,999
you don't go home and infect
everybody

153
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,999
you go to one of the designated
hotels

154
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,999
and the government has options
and over

155
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,999
120 000 hotel rooms across the
nation

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,999
that i think is a pretty good
idea

157
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,999
of you not if you're enough
think about

158
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,999
you if you're a traveler

159
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,999
well this room previously
occupied

160
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,999
nobody's traveling nobody's
traveling

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,999
nobody's traveling uh but yeah
if you

162
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,999
want to go to uh

163
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,999
uh to the to the obvious
hurdles but

164
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,999
maybe just a quick uh

165
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,999
update from wuhan one of our
producers

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,999

167
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,999

11 million people in 10 days
yeah

171
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,999
and i looked at the math and
said i

172
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,999
don't know how that's going to
work but

173
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,999

181
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,999
neighborhoods they'll test
everyone in

182
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:52,999
10 days

183
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,999
it's not really even a blip on
most

184
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,999
people's day

185
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,999
one client has a parking lot
that is

186
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,999
full of tables and trailers
that has two

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,999
tests 

188
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,999
blood and throat swabs takes
less than

189
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,999
10 minutes to stand in line and
go

190
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,999
through the process

191
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,999
yeah that is 11 million

192
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,999
people times 10 minutes i'm
just i

193
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,999
really want to see how they're
going to

194
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,999
complete this

195
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,999
and so far only a hundred and
thirteen

196
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,999
thousand done

197
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,999
um i had to do this went
bullcrap

198
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,999
i had to do this when i first
arrived in

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,999
wuhan so i couldn't start work
this will

200
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,999
be my third test since coming
back to

201
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,999
china wuhan is mostly open

202
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,999
some restaurants have dining
inside

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,999
while others are take

204
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,999
out only i can't use dd which
is uh

205
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,999
their version of uber only
taxis because

206
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,999
they track you

207
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,999
and you need a chinese id to
register to

208
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,999
be tracked by the

209
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,999
uh chinese uber our local wet
market is

210
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:44,999
open but not

211
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,999
inside they moved the market to
the

212
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,999
sidewalk and made it one-way
traffic

213
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,999
enter on one side and walk
through to

214
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,999
the to exit the opposite side

215
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,999
you need to have your
temperature

216
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,999
scanned before you enter any
place and

217
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,999
show the qr code having fun in
wuhan

218
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,999
when we first arrived a few
weeks ago

219
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,999
pollution level was great we
had blue

220
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,999
skies and some stars at night

221
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,999
now it's back to gray skies and
burning

222
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,999
eyes 

223
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,999
so uh i've never i've never
seen a blue

224
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,999
sky in china

225
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,999
well i i think it probably did
happen

226
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,999
when it was when it was all

227
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,999
shut down that's what he says
yeah but

228
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,999
it probably was quite
phenomenal so in

229
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,999
order not to go through all of
that

230
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,999
tracking and everything i
suggest the

231
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,999
mask i really do

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,999
i mean i hate it i'm against it
but

233
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,999
it's we have to sacrifice
somewhere this

234
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,999
and republicans need to shut up
and just

235
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,999
get on board

236
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,999
move on let's do it we can
always

237
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,999
do something later on and maybe
people

238
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,999
will forget about it but

239
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,999
this is not the hill anyone
should take

240
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,999
a stand on in my opinion

241
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,999
because we're dying i was
reading a

242
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,999
fashion 

243
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,999
a column about the fashion
industry this

244
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,999
morning 

245
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,999
you know and it and that the
nothing

246
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,999
could take

247
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,999
uh what's her name from vogue
magazine

248
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,999

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,999
glasses devil wears

252
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,999
prada movie made about her uh

253
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,999
the fashion industry is saying
well it

254
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,999
looks like nothing could take
her down

255
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,999
but the coronavirus

256
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,999
that can take her down and the
fashion

257
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,999
industry is obliterated

258
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,999
doesn't the fashion designers
are out of

259
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,999
business or

260
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,999
going out of business not that
i'm

261
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,999
crying about it but you know
there's a

262
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,999
lot of people that work in the
fashion

263
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,999
industry 

264
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,999
it's just the longer we we do
this the

265
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,999
longer it's going to be a
problem

266
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,999
and assholes like fauci and all
these

267
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,999
people need to get out of the
way we'll

268
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,999
wear some masks

269
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,999
make it optional for people to

270
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,999
requirement and let's go let's
move on

271
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:44,999
no 

272
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,999
no no we can't do that here's
austin

273
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,999
they've gone back to the color
codes of

274
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,999
a threat level of 911. tonight
amid

275
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,999
state demands to roll back its

276
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,999
coronavirus restrictions

277
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,999
austin travis county is now
releasing

278
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,999
new pandemic guidelines

279
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,999
divided into five stages the
chart

280
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,999
suggests what actions to

281
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,999
take based on community's risk
of

282
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,999
contracting 

283
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,999
the coronavirus stage one is
where we

284
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,999
want to be

285
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,999
the chart separates suggestions
by the

286
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,999
general public

287
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,999
low risk individuals and those
at high

288
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,999
risk such as anyone

289
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,999
over 65 years old so if you're
uh

290
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,999
in a high risk individual uh
then the

291
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,999
suggestion is

292
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,999
is that uh even in stage one

293
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,999
that you still avoid gatherings
for

294
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,999
everyone else social distancing
and mask

295
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,999
wearing appears

296
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,999
at stage two austin public
health says

297
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,999
we're in stage three

298
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,999
right now this means avoiding
groups of

299
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,999
more than 10 people

300
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,999
and avoiding non-essential
travel mayor

301
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,999
steve adler says

302
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,999
hitting stage five means the
city is in

303
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,999
a pretty bad place

304
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,999
and needs to take extreme
measures you

305
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,999
look at this thing it's like a
grid with

306
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:53,999
with 

307
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,999
colors and numbers and you know
and it's

308
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,999
reverse order so stage five is
worse

309
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,999
stage one is good

310
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,999
it's dumb it's dumb pussies man

311
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,999
go go go i wonder what this what

312
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,999
where this is preoccupation with

313
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,999
non-essential travel what does
that even

314
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:13,999
mean 

315
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,999
what is non-essential travel
it's uh

316
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,999
everything is non-essential
travel

317
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,999
unless uh you're an essential
person

318
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,999
but if you go into the store no
i think

319
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,999
travel means

320
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,999
i don't know i don't know i
don't care

321
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,999
it's all bull crap they can't
force

322
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,999
exactly what i said

323
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,999
yeah yeah but but we can sit in
bicker

324
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,999
or we can get going and i'm
very i'm

325
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,999
getting a little worried here
in austin

326
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,999
which is different from the
rest of

327
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,999
texas and the rest of texas is
doing it

328
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,999
a little differently and moving
a little

329
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,999
faster now here we all have to
be

330
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,999
pansies 

331
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,999
um and meanwhile just get back
to the

332
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,999
numbers because that's

333
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,999
really the problem there are

334
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,999
increasingly more there's
increasingly

335
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,999
more evidence

336
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,999
that this death count is really
really

337
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,999
full of crap

338
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,999
and do you remember i said that
i think

339
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,999
berks might have flipped and
she was all

340
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,999
kind of on trump's side and
maybe

341
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,999
anti-establishment that she's
trying to

342
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,999
save herself from the

343
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,999
impending doom that these
people will

344
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,999
meet when we finally figure out
where

345
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,999
all the money is

346
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,999
coming from and going and you
know

347
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,999
judicial watch is

348
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,999
doing all kinds of foyer
requests on the

349
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,999
fauci and the nih you don't
want that

350
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,999
you don't want that and i'm
sure he

351
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,999
hasn't covered everything he

352
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,999
don't want that he doesn't want
that

353
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,999
fouchy doesn't want that you
don't want

354
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,999
tom fish not me you don't want
tom

355
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,999
fitting in judicial watch
making a stink

356
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,999
about your business which has
been

357
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,999
as far as i can tell very shady
for a

358
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,999
long time

359
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,999
so uh this is a cnn report jim
acosta it

360
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,999
was a very long report i
chopped it down

361
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,999
because it was really billed as
tensions

362
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,999
rise 

363
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,999
uh between the administration
and let me

364
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,999
get the exact uh

365
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,999
exact title here tensions rise
between

366
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,999
the white house and cdc

367
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,999
as burke's critiques virus

368
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,999
tracking and the death rate in
control

369
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,999
of the coronavirus message
coming from

370
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,999
the white house president trump
is

371
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,999
giving the administration a pat
on the

372
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,999
back for the u.s

373
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,999
response to the pandemic with
the

374
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,999
enormous weight of the pandemic
hanging

375
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,999
over the white house sources
tell cnn

376
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,999
administration officials are
questioning

377
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,999
the accuracy of the coronavirus
death

378
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,999
toll in the u.s and whether the
number

379
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,999
of dead is being over

380
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,999
counted but that would fly in
the face

381
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,999
of testimony from top
administration

382
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,999
health expert dr anthony fauci

383
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,999
who said deaths are likely being

384
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,999
undercounted as some residents
in hard

385
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,999
hit new york died at home

386
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,999
and were never counted as covet
19

387
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,999
fatalities so in direct answer
to your

388
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,999
question i think you are correct

389
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,999
that the number is likely
higher i i

390
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,999
don't know exactly what percent
higher

391
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,999
but almost certainly it's higher

392
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,999
the president suggested new
york's

393
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,999
numbers i love how they did that

394
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,999
first they say the numbers are
bull crap

395
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,999
and then they get cut straight
to fauci

396
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,999
out of context

397
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,999
and but it's all no it's higher
it's

398
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,999
definitely higher this is a
good report

399
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,999
from cnn when it comes to
propaganda 19

400
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,999
fatalities 

401
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,999
so with direct answer to your
question i

402
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,999
think you are correct

403
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,999
that the number is likely
higher i i

404
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,999
don't know exactly what percent
higher

405
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,999
but almost certainly it's higher

406
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,999
the president suggested new
york's

407
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,999
number of debt was too high
last month i

408
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:15,999
see 

409
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,999
this morning where new york
added 3 000

410
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,999
deaths 

411
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,999
because they died and they're
now saying

412
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,999
rather than it was a heart
attack

413
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,999
they're saying it was a heart
attack

414
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,999
caused by this

415
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,999
trump allies on fox news have
zeroed in

416
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,999
on fouchy as an

417
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,999
obstacle to reopening the
country

418
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,999
blasting the doctor's cautious
approach

419
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,999
to the pandemic

420
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,999
is this the guy you want to ch
chart the

421
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,999
future of the country

422
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,999
maybe not this is a very
serious matter

423
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,999
the decisions we're making
right now

424
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,999
tony fauci has not been elected
to

425
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,999
anything fauci to be very blunt
is the

426
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,999
face of this failed
administrative

427
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,999
statement totally we've got to
question

428
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,999
the entire premise of this

429
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,999
the chief buffoon of the
professional dr

430
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,999
anthony pouchy

431
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,999
also seems to favor what the
democrats

432
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,999
want and that is

433
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,999
massive restrictions with no
end in

434
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,999
sight with all due respect to
dr fauci's

435
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,999
expertise 

436
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,999
no one elected him to anything
but

437
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,999
there's one big problem for the
white

438
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,999
house a cnn poll found a solid
majority

439
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,999
of americans trust

440
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,999
fauci not the president so the
whole

441
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,999
point is

442
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,999
they don't really interested in
talking

443
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,999
about the facts of the death
rate let's

444
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,999
just go ahead and say

445
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,999
fox news or assholes and fox
news is

446
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,999
doing the same to cnn

447
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,999
but every day i could play a
report like

448
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,999
this when police in cortez
colorado

449
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,999
found 35 year old sebastian
yellow

450
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,999
in their city park on may 4th
coroner

451
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:32,999
george 

452
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,999
devers quickly determined what
killed

453
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,999
the man it wasn't coveted it
was alcohol

454
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,999
toxicity yes he did have covet

455
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,999
but that is not what took his
life in

456
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:43,999
fact 

457
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,999
yellow's alcohol level is .55

458
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,999
nearly double the amount that's
fatal so

459
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,999
he literally drank himself to
death

460
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,999
yes exactly devers tested
yellow for

461
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,999
covet 19

462
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,999
after his death and the test was

463
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,999
positive 

464
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,999
the coroner said he was
surprised to see

465
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,999
the state then show cova deaths
in

466
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,999
montezuma county

467
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,999
go from two to three with
sebastian

468
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,999
yellows counting as number three

469
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,999
before the death certificate
was signed

470
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,999
they had already listed it as
it go to

471
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:16,999
death 

472
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,999
before the death certificate
was even

473
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,999
signed divers said he's been
trying to

474
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,999
get the state health department
to

475
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,999
explain how a case of fatal
alcohol

476
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,999
poisoning 

477
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,999
was classified as a covid death
and they

478
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,999
should have to be recording the
same way

479
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:29,999
that i do

480
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,999
they have to go off the truth
and the

481
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,999
facts 

482
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,999
and listed as such it's not the
first

483
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,999
time the state health
department has

484
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,999
come under fire for
reclassifying deaths

485
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,999
as covet fatalities

486
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,999
last month a cbs4 investigation
found

487
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,999
attending physicians at this
centennial

488
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,999
nursing home

489
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,999
ruled three deaths were not
related to

490
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,999
coronavirus 

491
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,999
but since the residents had
tested

492
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,999
positive for covet 19

493
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,999
the state then listed them as

494
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,999
coronavirus deaths

495
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,999
there you go every day you
could have

496
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,999
one of these reports every
single day

497
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:01,999
but it's just

498
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,999
what every exactly since the
beginning

499
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,999
we've done one of these

500
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,999
there's just this is you don't
see

501
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,999
where's the other reports

502
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,999
in other words you know for the
word

503
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,999
under counting how right i
don't have

504
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:14,999
those 

505
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,999
outrageous reports coming
constantly no

506
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,999
we can't have that

507
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,999
there'll be none of that uh i
put in the

508
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,999
show not doable

509
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,999
i put in the show notes a uh a
report

510
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,999
from bmj that that's a big deal
what

511
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,999
does bmj stand for

512
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,999
something medical journal what
is it the

513
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,999
bmj 

514
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,999
british medical journal i think
it's uh

515
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,999
let me see bmj i think this is
bmj.com

516
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,999
let me see what is it

517
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,999
oh bnj yeah bmj.com oh the
leading yeah

518
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,999
there it is

519
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,999
they don't even expand the
acronym you

520
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,999
a-holes 

521
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,999
the bmj is the something of

522
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,999
medical journal okay anyway
whatever it

523
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,999
is it's a real medical journal
real

524
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,999
medical report abstract this is

525
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,999
a cluster randomized trial of
cloth

526
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,999
masks compared with medical
masks

527
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,999
and the objective was to see if
there's

528
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,999
a difference what is good what
is not

529
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,999
good it's all marked up one of
our

530
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,999
producers actually was kind
enough to do

531
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,999
this conclusion

532
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,999
uh the study is the first of
cloth masks

533
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,999
and the results caution against
the use

534
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,999
of cloth

535
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,999
masks which is what we're all
using

536
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,999
because you know

537
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,999
we don't have enough disposable
medical

538
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,999
masks moisture retention

539
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,999
reuse of cloth masks and poor
filtration

540
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,999
may result in increased risk of

541
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,999
infection 

542
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,999
it's right there in the bmj

543
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,999
so we are not getting good
information

544
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,999
this is what's frustrating this
is

545
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,999
what's driving people i think

546
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,999
nuts i have a one of our
producers works

547
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,999
in a store which is starting to
open up

548
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,999
and this is believe it or not a
store

549
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,999
with democrats

550
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,999
and uh i just listened to this
note that

551
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,999
has been written to the
managers of this

552
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,999
uh place managers i've been in
the store

553
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,999
for 90 seconds and two of the
first nine

554
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,999
people i walked past first
thing i'm not

555
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,999
wearing their face masks while
within

556
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,999
six feet of other staff and in
public

557
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,999
spaces 

558
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,999
all uppercase now i am
disappointed in

559
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,999
what i thought was a team

560
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,999
of individuals who appreciated
an

561
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,999
employer that had as much
concern for

562
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,999
them as they do themselves

563
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,999
we spent the last month in net
losses as

564
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,999
a result of our selfless act of

565
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,999
closing the stores and paying
everyone

566
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,999
for for our week so that we can
do our

567
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,999
part 

568
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,999
in trying to keep our staff and
their

569
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,999
families healthy safe as well as

570
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,999
mentally and emotionally secure

571
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,999
in very uncertain times all
caps still

572
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,999
that won't happen

573
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,999
we can't get our money back but
i damn

574
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,999
sure we'll take action to make
sure it

575
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,999
was not in vain

576
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,999
v-a-n-e misspelling we will do

577
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,999
absolutely everything in our
power to

578
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:53,999
prevent 

579
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,999
sickness and the risk of having
to close

580
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,999
our doors again

581
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,999
blah blah blah let me be clear
in

582
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,999
writing so there's no
misunderstanding

583
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,999
i won't do the voice anymore
we're

584
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,999
wearing a face mask

585
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,999
wearing a face mask by
employees and sub

586
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,999
i just spit all over my screen

587
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,999
wearing a face mask by
employees and

588
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,999
subcontractors is a requirement

589
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,999
while conducting company
business at any

590
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,999
time and anywhere and while our
property

591
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,999
for any reason

592
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,999
following company protocol for

593
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,999
preventing covenant spread at a
rate of

594
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,999
100 percent is a requirement

595
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,999
the grounds are simple employees

596
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,999
terminated for being a clear
and present

597
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,999
danger to health safety and
well-being

598
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,999
of our team members and
customers by not

599
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,999
taking the measures required by
company

600
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,999
policy of wearing a face mask
to help

601
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,999
prevent the spread of overnight
pain

602
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,999
that's pretty serious where
would you

603
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,999
run into this little

604
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,999
screed one of our producers uh
who i'm

605
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,999
going to keep anonymous

606
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,999
uh works there and this was
sent to her

607
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,999
yeah it's really there's

608
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,999
that's why i'm saying who cares
let's

609
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,999
just go for it do it

610
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,999
get over it already so we can
just move

611
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,999
on because

612
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,999
we'll never get out of this
we'll never

613
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,999
ever get out of this by the way
the cdc

614
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,999
data which i have the link for

615
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,999
in the show notes couple of our

616
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,999
producers record this data

617
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,999
and uh and you know from week
to week

618
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,999
etc 

619
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,999
and this producer said i went
to update

620
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,999
my spreadsheet notice that they
have

621
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,999
increased all of the uh 2019

622
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,999
2020 season numbers even though
most

623
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,999
weeks have been listed as 100
percent

624
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,999
reported before

625
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,999
increased total deaths by
literally

626
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,999
thousands per week even though
they said

627
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,999
in their own and we have the
proof their

628
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,999
own documents this is 100

629
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,999
counted or 100 reported and
then they

630
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,999
re they updated it and they
just added

631
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,999
thousands 

632
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,999
to uh to several weeks what yeah

633
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,999
yeah the cdc is is not a a good
outfit

634
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,999
no it's been corrupt for years
now to go

635
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,999
back to your

636
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,999
uh your statement about this
not being

637
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,999
uh a requirement and not being

638
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,999
uh a law that we have to adhere
to

639
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,999
you're of course

640
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,999
absolutely right here's dr drew
who was

641
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,999
still i don't know if he's on
fouchy's

642
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,999
fear squad anymore or if he's

643
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,999
freewheeling but here's

644
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,999
his latest and let's remind
ourselves

645
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,999
the cdc

646
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,999
never recommended shutdown they
never

647
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,999
recommended 

648
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,999
shutdown they recommended social

649
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,999
distancing and let's not
confuse social

650
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,999
distancing and shut down those
are two

651
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,999
very different things shutting
down

652
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,999
businesses isolating in place

653
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,999
those those are far-reaching
measures

654
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,999
beyond 

655
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,999
mere social distancing so the
real

656
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,999
question is

657
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,999
was that necessary might there
have been

658
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,999
a more

659
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,999
rational intermediate step to
take close

660
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,999
some businesses

661
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,999
close some schools isolate
nursing homes

662
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,999
might that have been a more

663
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,999
sophisticated way to do this

664
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,999
and given that in california we
overshot

665
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,999
by somewhere between a

666
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,999
a factor of 10 and 50.

667
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,999
evidence we did suggest we did
a great

668
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,999
job and maybe we did too good a
job

669
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,999
depending 

670
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,999
on how bad our economy is hit

671
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,999
oh brother so now i have
probably the

672
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,999
most frightening thing of the
day i'll

673
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,999
get it out of the way right away

674
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,999
thank you while we cannot while
we have

675
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,999
not been forced to shut down
we've been

676
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,999
compliant 

677
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,999
very compliant human resources
doing as

678
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,999
we're told social engineering
and great

679
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,999
play we're being

680
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,999
shamed into compliance

681
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,999
and the ultimate question is
when a

682
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,999
vaccine comes around

683
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,999
how is that going to work now
um we'll

684
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,999
probably dive in later into the
this

685
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,999
rick bright character who keeps
coming

686
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,999
back who

687
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,999
was slated to be the guy
running the

688
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,999
program now the military

689
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,999
is going to do that we already
said i

690
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,999
think a couple weeks ago there
was going

691
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:52,999
to be

692
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,999
warp speed operation warp speed
was the

693
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,999
get the vaccine but

694
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,999
done and and and out and ready
for

695
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,999
distribution 

696
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,999
by january of 2021 so when that
comes

697
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,999
out 

698
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,999
um do we will we all have to
take it is

699
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,999
it going to be optional will
you take

700
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,999
the vaccine john

701
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,999
uh no nobody in the family is
taking

702
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,999
this vaccine and what if you
were forced

703
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,999
to take the vaccine

704
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,999
no that's not going to happen
here is a

705
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,999
constitutional lawyer alan
dershowitz

706
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,999
let's be very clear how we
break down

707
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,999
this issue

708
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,999
the city of new york the state
of new

709
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,999
york has the power to close a
park

710
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,999
based on their view that it
would be

711
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,999
helpful in defeating the
pandemic

712
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,999
absolutely no question about
that the

713
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,999
supreme court has case after
case after

714
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,999
case 

715
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,999
saying that public health
justifies

716
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,999
closing down parks

717
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,999
closing down public areas the
next

718
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,999
question is does the governor
have

719
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,999
the right to do that governors
generally

720
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,999
are not authorized to make the
law

721
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,999
they're authorized to enforce
the law so

722
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,999
you'd have to look to see if
there were

723
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,999
legislative authority allowing
the

724
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,999
governor to close the park

725
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,999
if there is then it would be
legitimate

726
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:07,999
uh 

727
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,999
let me put it very clearly you
have no

728
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,999
constitutional right

729
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,999
to endanger the public and
spread

730
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,999
a disease even if you disagree
you have

731
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,999
no right not to be vaccinated

732
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,999
you have no right not to wear a
mask and

733
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,999
if you refuse to be vaccinated
the state

734
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,999
has the power

735
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,999
to literally take you to a
doctor's

736
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,999
office 

737
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,999
and plunge a needle into your
arm if the

738
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,999
vaccination 

739
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,999
is designed to prevent the
spreading

740
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,999
disease if the vaccination

741
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,999
is only to prevent a disease
that you

742
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,999
will get for example if there's
a

743
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,999
disease that will kill you

744
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,999
you have the right to refuse
that but

745
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,999
you have no right to refuse

746
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,999
to be vaccinated against a
contagious

747
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,999
disease 

748
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,999
public health the police power
of the

749
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,999
constitution gives the state
the power

750
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,999
to compel that

751
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,999
and there are cases in the
united states

752
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,999
supreme court

753
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,999
holy crap

754
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,999
i was not aware that that was a

755
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,999
constitutionally 

756
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,999
somehow possible well i'd like
to hear

757
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,999
other interpretations

758
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,999
dershowitz has got one opinion
about a

759
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,999
lot of stuff right but we
typically

760
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,999
like what dershowitz has to say
can't

761
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,999
just because you disagree he
can't say

762
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,999
yeah you know but he's become a
bit of a

763
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,999
uh uh

764
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,999
arm uh s waiver recently i mean
he's

765
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,999
he d i mean he's what he's
saying is

766
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,999
probably true but i'm sure
there's

767
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,999
other ways of dealing with it
well this

768
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,999
is not going to happen we're
not going

769
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,999
to get a shot

770
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,999
do you remember h1n1 this wine
flew yeah

771
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,999
we're still waiting

772
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,999
still waiting for the video on
this show

773
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,999
we discussed oh there's gonna
be two

774
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,999
remember the whole

775
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,999
rigmarole is gonna have to be
two shots

776
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,999
you know maybe three and then
it could

777
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,999
come to one and then become
part of the

778
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,999
flu shot and there's all these
different

779
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,999
things 

780
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,999
that's what that era when
people at uh

781
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,999
because i took pictures and put
in the

782
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,999
newsletter 

783
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,999
where they were giving the
shots out in

784
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,999
albany they had

785
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,999
a line oh i remember that yes
yeah

786
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,999
opening a star wars

787
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,999
the public will line up for
this shot in

788
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:09,999
such a

789
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,999
to such a degree yeah that you
there's

790
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,999
not going to they're going to
force

791
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,999
anyone to get the shot because
there's

792
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:15,999
going to be

793
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,999
so many people getting the shot
they're

794
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,999
going to probably run out of it

795
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,999
yeah that's a good point that's
a good

796
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,999
point 

797
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,999
don't line up but it'll be
lined up a

798
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,999
mile long

799
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,999
and as the president says do
you mean a

800
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,999
fully approved vaccine for

801
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,999
everyone the full public or a
partially

802
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,999
approved vaccine with emergency
use no

803
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,999
we're looking for a full
vaccine for

804
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,999
everyone 

805
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,999
that wants to get it not
everybody's

806
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,999
going to want to get it there
you go

807
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,999
but we're looking at a full
vaccine is

808
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,999
that a correct statement yeah
will

809
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,999
issues yes synthetic so the
answer what

810
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,999
is the questioning we're
looking at a

811
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,999
full vaccine what is that like
a half

812
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,999
hey man i'll take the uh a
quarter a

813
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,999
quarterback 

814
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,999
she was asking are you gonna
something

815
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,999
that's not quite fully approved

816
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,999
i understand i understand you
could have

817
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,999
a full vaccine is that a correct

818
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,999
statement yeah will

819
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,999
issues yes so the answer is the
answer

820
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,999
is yes we're working for a fully

821
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,999
approved vaccine but we'll also
use the

822
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,999
tools we have for instance
emergency use

823
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,999
authorization 

824
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,999
um as as appropriate we use all
of our

825
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,999
regulatory tools to bring
vaccine

826
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,999
available for

827
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,999
the entire american population
by

828
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,999
january okay and then mr
president can

829
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,999
you just clarify

830
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,999
why are some of you wearing a
mask and

831
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,999
why are some of you not wearing
a mask

832
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,999
oh please we've all been tested
i've

833
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,999
been tested we've all been
tested and

834
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,999
we're 

835
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,999
uh quite a distance away and
we're

836
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,999
outdoor so uh i told them i
gave them

837
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,999
the option they could wear it
or not

838
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,999
so you can blame it on me but i
gave

839
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,999
them the option we could wear
it or not

840
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,999
so the president is there
saying kind of

841
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,999
what i'd like optional vaccine

842
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,999
optional masks and also
optional uh

843
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,999
open carry so rick bright

844
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,999
was the guy who was who has

845
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,999
traditionally for many years

846
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,999
he's been in and out of
government and

847
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,999
back to

848
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,999
the pharmaceutical industry
multiple

849
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,999
times and he is the guy that was

850
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,999
supposed to be

851
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,999
in charge of the vaccine this
is the

852
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,999
barda the biomedical advanced
research

853
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,999
and development authority

854
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,999
and this was unceremoniously
taken away

855
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,999
from him

856
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,999
as he was pushed out and now of
course

857
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,999
he's a whistleblower

858
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,999
so oh yeah we he has a job but
listen to

859
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,999
this guy's career

860
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,999
and you start to understand why
you

861
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,999
really don't want him

862
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,999
in the business of vaccines

863
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,999
in this case certainly as he
started

864
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,999
um well in atlanta georgia
vaccine

865
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,999
research center

866
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,999
98 to 2002 we worked at the cdc

867
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,999
in atlanta uh where he studied
influenza

868
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,999
a virus and the h5n1

869
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,999
from 2000 2003 he went to the

870
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,999
pharmaceutical 

871
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,999
industry which is always great
when

872
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,999
you're in government and then
you go to

873
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,999
the private

874
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,999
industry and then you can
shepherd stuff

875
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,999
in so he went to

876
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,999
altea therapeutics is which is

877
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,999
also in atlanta and he was a
senior

878
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,999
research for their vaccine and

879
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,999
immuno immunology programs in
2003 he

880
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,999
went back to the cdc so only a
year that

881
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,999
he was in private business

882
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,999
and uh then he was still in
atlanta but

883
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,999
then he was focused on the

884
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,999
avian flu and he was there
until 2006

885
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,999
then 2006 to 2008 he went to

886
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,999
nova vaxx like the number one
penny

887
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,999
stock of

888
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,999
vaccine bull crap on the stock
market

889
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:33,999
during that time

890
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,999
he participated in world health

891
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,999
organization committees on
vaccine

892
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,999
development and pandemic
preparedness

893
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,999
and then in 2008 he worked at
the bill

894
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,999
and melinda gates foundation

895
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,999
and then in 2010 he came back
to the

896
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,999
department of health and human

897
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,999
services so the guy

898
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,999
is way too in entrenched in

899
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,999
in the pharmaceutical business
i don't

900
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,999
think you want this guy

901
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,999
running the show and the fact
that he's

902
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,999
so pissed off about it and so
angry that

903
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,999
he's become a whistleblower

904
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,999
i think tells us i'm sorry god

905
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,999
i think that tells us that you
know this

906
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,999
was not the way it's supposed
to go this

907
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,999
is 

908
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,999
we are going to learn
eventually so much

909
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,999
about 

910
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,999
the pharmaceutical and medical
industry

911
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,999
and all the egos and all the
money that

912
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,999
takes place

913
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,999
and it's going it's going to
blow us

914
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,999
away 

915
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,999
because the scandal and the
bull crap on

916
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,999
the money is

917
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,999
ten times bigger than than than
movies

918
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,999
especially 

919
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,999
today this is rick bright
testifying

920
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,999
because of course we got to
testify

921
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,999
today the world is confronting
a public

922
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,999
health emergency unlike any
we've seen

923
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,999
in over a century

924
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,999
we are facing a highly
transmissible and

925
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,999
deadly virus which not only
claims lives

926
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,999
but also disrupts the very
foundations

927
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,999
of our society

928
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,999
the american health care system
is being

929
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,999
taxed to the limit

930
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,999
our economy is spiraling
downward and

931
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,999
our population is being
paralyzed by

932
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,999
fear 

933
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,999
stemming from a lack of a
coordinated

934
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,999
response 

935
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,999
and a dearth of accurate clear

936
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,999
communication 

937
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,999
about the path forward
americans yearn

938
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,999
to get back to work

939
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,999
to open their businesses and to
provide

940
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,999
for their families

941
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,999
i get that however what we do

942
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,999
must be done what is he like in
charge

943
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,999
so he gets he sounds like he's
the

944
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,999
premier of canada

945
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,999
get back to work to open their

946
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,999
businesses and to provide for
their

947
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,999
families 

948
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,999
i get that yeah but this is the

949
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,999
this is the attitude of these
people i

950
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,999
am king

951
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,999
however what we do must be done

952
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,999
carefully 

953
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,999
with guidance from the best
scientific

954
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,999
minds 

955
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,999
our window of opportunity is
closing if

956
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,999
we fail to improve our response
now

957
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,999
based on science i fear the
pandemic

958
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,999
will get worse and be prolonged
yeah

959
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,999
this is my favorite part is now
we're

960
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,999
bringing it all back around to
science

961
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,999
and trust the scientists

962
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,999
because the republicans in
particular

963
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,999
don't believe in science

964
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,999
there will be likely a
resurgence of

965
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,999
cobit 19 this fall

966
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,999
it'll be greatly compounded by
the

967
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,999
challenges of seasonal influenza

968
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,999
without better planning 2020
could be

969
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,999
the darkest

970
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,999
these guys this goes on with
biden too

971
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,999
where's the science where's the
science

972
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,999
that says it's going to

973
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,999
recur in uh in the fall of 2020
oh well

974
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,999
there's no specifically what
science no

975
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,999
he's talking about science
science

976
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,999
science 

977
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,999
science specifically name
something what

978
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,999
study do they know for a fact
that this

979
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,999
thing's not falling apart

980
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,999
i mean is there any evidence
whatsoever

981
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,999
this is all

982
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,999
speculative without better
planning

983
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,999
2020 could be the darkest
winter in

984
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,999
modern history

985
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,999
first and foremost i love could
be the

986
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,999
darkest winter in modern history

987
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,999
have you heard of the hunger
winter

988
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,999
a-hole without better planning

989
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,999
2020 could be the darkest
winter in

990
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,999
modern history

991
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,999
first and foremost we need to be

992
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,999
truthful with the american
people

993
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,999
americans deserve the truth the
truth

994
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,999
must be based on science

995
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,999
we have the world's greatest
scientists

996
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,999
now the truth must be based on
science

997
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,999
there's a very interesting
phrase and i

998
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,999
think we're going to hear this
a lot

999
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:21,999
more 

1000
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,999
because there's really only
truth in one

1001
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,999
thing and that's mathematics

1002
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,999
and what they're showing us is

1003
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,999
mathematics and there's no
truth in it

1004
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,999
you know what i'm saying
science is is

1005
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,999
not always truth in fact it's
kind of

1006
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,999
never truth but we've been
through this

1007
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,999
with global warming

1008
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,999
and the green new deal and
climate

1009
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,999
change and

1010
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,999
is just coming back and please
ignore

1011
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,999
the math that we showed you
that was all

1012
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,999
wrong trust in science people

1013
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,999
americans deserve the truth the
truth

1014
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,999
must be based on science

1015
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,999
we have the world's greatest
scientists

1016
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,999
let us lead

1017
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,999
let us speak without fear of
retribution

1018
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,999
there you go john let us lead
let us

1019
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,999
lead 

1020
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,999
they want to give the power to
the

1021
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,999
scientists to let them lead you

1022
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,999
we must listen each of us can
and must

1023
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,999
do our part now

1024
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,999
on tuesday dr fauci delivered a
message

1025
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,999
and a voice that is clear and

1026
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,999
trustworthy 

1027
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,999
has encouraged us to act with
caution as

1028
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,999
we return to our daily lives

1029
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,999
we should listen to him and
other

1030
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,999
scientists sharing their
expertise

1031
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,999
yeah it's so bad that to push
the

1032
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,999
science and believe the signs

1033
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,999
truth is in science cnn did a
special

1034
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,999
sanjay gupta anderson pooper
bring it in

1035
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,999
to that i have to play a couple
of

1036
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,999
things because because

1037
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,999
bright's testimony was a fiasco
and it

1038
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,999
was a disaster

1039
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,999
and uh i want to play two
things that

1040
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,999
preluded this little

1041
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,999
this spiel which everybody
clipped about

1042
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,999
oh we're gonna have this dark
winter and

1043
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,999
all the rest of it let's listen
to how

1044
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,999
this thing actually began

1045
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,999
this is the pro bright testimony

1046
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,999
confusion 

1047
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,999
okay hold on here we go five
minutes for

1048
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,999
an opening statement

1049
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,999
well you don't think it's
resolved well

1050
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,999
are we going to ask if

1051
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,999
he wants to be represented by
council

1052
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,999
and then who the council is

1053
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,999
dr bride do you wish to be
represented

1054
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,999
by council

1055
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,999
yes okay and then

1056
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,999
could she identify herself for
the

1057
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,999
record and for the

1058
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,999
record would uh council please

banks all right thank you

1064
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,999
i think that's all we needed to
do good

1065
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,999
parliament 

1066
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,999
all right well the chairman is

1067
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,999
recognized for

1068
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,999
his father you've got a
parliamentary

1069
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,999
parliamentary question i'm glad
you got

1070
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,999
this john this is very good

1071
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,999
it's president so gentleman
state is

1072
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,999
parliamentary 

1073
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,999
yeah it will the witness be
under oath

1074
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,999
because if you have a witness

1075
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,999
whistleblower testimony under o
and i a

1076
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,999
witness would normally be under
oath and

1077
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,999
if not today

1078
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,999
he's under oath not under oath
then if

1079
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,999
we get into whistleblower
allegations

1080
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,999
how can we

1081
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,999
be sure that the witness is
telling the

1082
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,999
truth uh uh

1083
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,999
under under oath if they're not
under

1084
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,999
oath and if they're not under
oath

1085
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,999
then how can you talk about the

1086
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,999
whistleblower complaints

1087
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,999
i think that's in a fair and
equitable

1088
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,999
manner 

1089
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,999
i i thank the gentleman for his
inquiry

1090
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,999
all witnesses know that it is
illegal

1091
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,999
uh to lie to congress and in

1092
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,999
our subcommittee unlike o and i

1093
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,999
uh they are the only
subcommittee that

1094
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,999
i mean it's a practice um it's
true it's

1095
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,999
a tradition

1096
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,999
uh but we don't swear people in
uh

1097
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,999
but witnesses know that um it is

1098
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,999
illegal to lie to congress usc

1099
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,999
1003 or something i believe
thank you

1100
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,999
now a couple of things one this
is anna

1101
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,999
eshoo that's that's heading this

1102
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,999
subcommittee and she doesn't
know what

1103
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,999
she's doing

1104
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,999
and and so the republican guy
has to

1105
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,999
tell her how to do things
properly and

1106
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,999
they have to walk through a
bunch of

1107
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,999
things 

1108
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,999
but this lying to congress
thing i

1109
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,999
didn't realize and apparently
there is

1110
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,999
some us code

1111
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,999
so what about james clapper oh
that

1112
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,999
doesn't count

1113
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,999
the thing is that we're living
in a

1114
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,999
world of calling out hypocrisy
and

1115
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,999
that's all anyone does all the
time

1116
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,999
and and it's it's it has no

1117
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,999
it's no benefit it doesn't go
anywhere

1118
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,999
it hasn't gone anywhere so far

1119
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,999
so let's get to part two this
is another

1120
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,999
uh that now the uh

1121
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,999
uh the head republican whose
name i

1122
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,999
wrote on that back of an
envelope i got

1123
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,999
it back there he's from oregon

1124
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,999
he's a congressman he's very
good by the

1125
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,999
way this guy

1126
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,999
and i'll get his uh go get the
envelope

1127
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,999
but 

1128
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,999
uh now this is the beginning of
the

1129
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,999
the kind of the true confusion
and the

1130
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,999
hook and this makes the whole
thing a

1131
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,999
a joke and a fiasco and in fact
and they

1132
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,999
brought up this lawyer he wants
to be

1133
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,999
represented by

1134
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,999
council he says yeah i want to
be

1135
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,999
represented by council she says

1136
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,999
absolutely nothing the whole
time he

1137
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,999
never once

1138
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,999
asks her a question so that
she's just

1139
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,999
up there as a joke

1140
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,999
and so this part of it makes it
even

1141
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,999
more of a joke this is uh

1142
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,999
uh representative walden i
believe

1143
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,999
walden 

1144
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,999
walden greg walden from uh he's
quite

1145
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,999
good quite good

1146
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,999
we have asked for and this
committee

1147
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,999
should hold hearings to find a
path

1148
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,999
forward to reform the strategic
national

1149
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,999
stockpile 

1150
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,999
to increase domestic
manufacturing of

1151
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,999
critical supplies and
disentangle our

1152
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,999
supply chains from china

1153
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,999
we should be exploring
strategies for

1154
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,999
increased testing so we can
begin to

1155
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,999
safely reopen our economy

1156
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,999
we need to find ways to improve
access

1157
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,999
to mental health and provide
relief

1158
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,999
both for our health care
providers on

1159
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,999
the front lines treating covet
19 cases

1160
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,999
and our health care workers who
have

1161
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,999
been furloughed because their
hospitals

1162
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,999
are closed

1163
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,999
we should be conducting rigorous

1164
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,999
oversight of the trillions of
dollars

1165
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,999
myriad new policies congress has

1166
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,999
appropriated and enacted in the
last

1167
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,999
three months and we should be

1168
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,999
investigating 

1169
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,999
really investigating
allegations like dr

1170
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,999
bright's that raised concern

1171
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,999
that our about our nation's
coronavirus

1172
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,999
response 

1173
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,999
that does not appear to be why
we're

1174
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,999
actually here today and frankly
it

1175
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,999
saddens me dr bright

1176
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,999
your allegations are serious
they

1177
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,999
deserve a real investigation

1178
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,999
i know the office of special
accounts

1179
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,999
with whom you filed your
complaint will

1180
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,999
do just that

1181
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,999
and i know they take their work

1182
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,999
seriously and we'll hear you
out and

1183
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:23,999
importantly 

1184
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,999
we'll give those named in your
complaint

1185
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,999
an opportunity to have their
side heard

1186
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,999
as well

1187
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,999
i must tell you that many of us
on our

1188
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,999
committee were confused when we
learned

1189
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,999
from a tweet this hearing was
scheduled

1190
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,999
in the wake of your

1191
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,999
complaint as you know that's
certainly

1192
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,999
not how we do things at the
energy and

1193
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,999
commerce committee

1194
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,999
not long after the notice of
this being

1195
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,999
a whistleblower hearing we were
advised

1196
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:43,999
you were

1197
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,999
here as a government witness
not a

1198
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,999
whistleblower but then we were
told you

1199
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,999
were not representing

1200
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,999
the government but yourself the
hearing

1201
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,999
title suggests the hearings
about

1202
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,999
protecting scientific integrity

1203
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,999
yet the chair invited a witness
who will

1204
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,999
not be speaking to that issue

1205
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,999
so it's all pretty confusing
and unusual

1206
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,999
to say the least

1207
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,999
here we are in the middle of a
pandemic

1208
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,999
and we aren't given time to
secure our

1209
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,999
witnesses conduct appropriate
research

1210
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,999
or require documents

1211
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,999
that could aid in our
understanding of

1212
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,999
the situation you face in the
country

1213
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,999
face 

1214
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,999
so the whole thing is a sham

1215
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,999
of course it is it was set up
so bright

1216
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,999
can go up there and say
something

1217
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,999
present and lie and do whatever
he wants

1218
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,999
he didn't have to

1219
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,999
do whatever he wants but the
joke is he

1220
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,999
didn't do a very good job of
any of it

1221
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,999
except that one clear one you
played

1222
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,999
which is pretty much what
everyone

1223
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,999
played 

1224
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,999
so that was a i consider the
whole thing

1225
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,999
an epic fail

1226
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,999
well i was being honest about
it yeah

1227
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,999
but going back like

1228
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,999
the push now and that's really
wanting

1229
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,999
to want to prove with that clip

1230
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,999
the push is for uh

1231
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,999
truth science is truth that's
the push

1232
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,999
and that's

1233
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,999
and let the scientists leave we
kind of

1234
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,999
heard that but now he's

1235
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,999
this this guy he's the pied
piper and

1236
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,999
he's supposed to say the things

1237
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,999
everyone's going to repeat and
you'll

1238
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:03,999
hear 

1239
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,999
well as dr bright said you know
you're

1240
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,999
going to hear that i don't
think so

1241
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,999
so we had the big uh rhona
special on

1242
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,999
cnn with anderson pooper

1243
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,999
and sanjay gupta and there she
is the

1244
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,999
expert when it comes to science
all

1245
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,999
things science the

1246
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,999
uh ever so idealistic gratitude

1247
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,999
i've seen you talk about online
too is

1248
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,999
just how important it is to

1249
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,999
listen to experts and listen to
science

1250
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,999
and this is a time

1251
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,999
when you know i was not a very
good

1252
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,999
science student um

1253
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,999
when i was in school but this
is a time

1254
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,999
it seems

1255
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,999
that you know the global
scientific

1256
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,999
community 

1257
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,999
is so critically important and
we're

1258
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,999
really seeing just how
important it is

1259
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,999
to to follow science yes yes
exactly and

1260
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,999
and i hope that is she a phd

1261
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,999
oh oh yes listen to her message
she'll

1262
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,999
do 50 seconds of the same thing

1263
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,999
we can see now that the
scientific

1264
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,999
community are stepping up

1265
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,999
and they are they are speaking
out more

1266
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:05,999
than they have

1267
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,999
they're done before you know i
gotta

1268
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,999
tell you for a 16 year old
swedish girl

1269
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,999
the term

1270
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,999
stepping up like the scientists
are

1271
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,999
stepping up is an

1272
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,999
odd thing for her to be using
just in my

1273
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,999
opinion you know you

1274
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,999
i don't know is that how kids
talk about

1275
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,999
that 

1276
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,999
oh the swedes that's all they
talk about

1277
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,999
stepping up

1278
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,999
yes yes exactly and and i hope
that

1279
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,999
we can see now the the
scientific

1280
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,999
community are stepping up

1281
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,999
and they are they are speaking
out more

1282
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,999
than they have

1283
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,999
they're done before because
obviously

1284
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,999
this is a crisis that would
require the

1285
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,999
scientific community to speak up

1286
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,999
and um and i hope that people
really

1287
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,999
it feels like uh science is
getting

1288
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,999
the role of science is is
changing now

1289
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,999
it's becoming more

1290
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,999
people are starting to realize
that we

1291
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,999
are actually depending on
science and

1292
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,999
that we need to listen to
scientists

1293
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,999
and experts and i i really hope
that we

1294
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,999
that that stays and that's that
also

1295
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,999
um is is for for other crises
such as

1296
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,999
the climate crisis and the
environmental

1297
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,999
crisis 

1298
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,999
that we actually understand
that we have

1299
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,999
to listen to to

1300
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,999
the scientists

1301
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,999
don't you think that the
climate folk

1302
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,999
uh are freaked out about this
whole

1303
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,999
situation because they've been

1304
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,999
talking about being put on the
back

1305
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,999
burner they've been taken off
the stove

1306
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,999
yeah they're back in the pantry
where

1307
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:43,999
they belong

1308
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,999
yeah i think so that's why it's

1309
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,999
important to have greta back on
the

1310
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,999
scene so she can maintain her
profile

1311
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,999
people forget pretty quickly

1312
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,999
but i'll tell you okay we have
anderson

1313
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,999
cooper 

1314
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:53,999
like you said the big three
there was

1315
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,999
anderson cooper who

1316
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,999
immediately says he was not he
was a

1317
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,999
lousy student

1318
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,999
and he didn't get flunked
science so

1319
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,999
he's an idiot

1320
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,999
and so then you get greta tune
barry

1321
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,999
who's who

1322
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,999
it was a kid she's just a kid
let's face

1323
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,999
reality 

1324
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,999
and then you have a the md a
doctor yeah

1325
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:13,999
but 

1326
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,999
it was only just a panel doogie
houser

1327
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,999
was only just as a kid as well
you know

1328
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,999
it's like these kids can be
very smart

1329
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,999
they can be geniuses

1330
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:22,999
remember who you're talking to
your

1331
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,999
average cnn viewer

1332
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,999
they're cnn viewers which is a
small

1333
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,999
group of people let's face it

1334
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,999
it's under a million generally
speaking

1335
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,999
uh is uh we probably have a
bigger

1336
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,999
audience 

1337
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,999
probably is the dumbest
audience that

1338
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,999
watches television and thinks
they're

1339
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:41,999
keeping up

1340
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,999
because you have to you have to
imagine

1341
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,999
you think you're keeping up
because it's

1342
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,999
all about news news news news

1343
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,999
oh no opinion opinion opinions
it's all

1344
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,999
about opinion

1345
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,999
the central intelligence
broadcast

1346
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,999
system 

1347
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,999
i think really did a good job
in uh

1348
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,999
pitting the two main people
that it's

1349
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,999
all about who's going to lead
us that's

1350
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,999
that's what it's coming down to
this

1351
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,999
week i haven't seen the sunday
shows but

1352
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,999
i'm sure it's part of it

1353
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,999
who is going to lead us trump
the

1354
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,999
president 

1355
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,999
or fauci the god president trump

1356
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,999
continues to push the country

1357
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,999
to quickly bounce back and says
he does

1358
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,999
not consider that happening

1359
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,999
without reopening schools
claiming the

1360
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,999
virus has had very little

1361
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,999
impact on young people but
you're right

1362
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,999
his own top health experts

1363
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,999
disagree lucky wants to play
all sides

1364
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:29,999
of the

1365
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,999
equation president trump pushed
back

1366
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,999
against the warning dr anthony
fauci

1367
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,999
delivered at a senate hearing
the day

1368
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:37,999
before 

1369
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,999
there is a real risk that you
will

1370
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,999
trigger an outbreak

1371
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,999
that you may not be able to
control we

1372
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,999
don't know everything about
this virus

1373
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,999
and we really better be very
careful

1374
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,999
particularly when it comes to
children

1375
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,999
just to interrupt i'm a little
tired of

1376
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,999
we don't know very much about
this virus

1377
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,999
why not i mean if you've been
studying

1378
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,999
this for

1379
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,999
40 years it's similar to other
sars

1380
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,999
virus 

1381
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,999
i'm i don't feel very
comfortable

1382
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,999
hearing we don't know we don't
know we

1383
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,999
don't know but then

1384
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,999
telling me it's gonna be the
worst

1385
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,999
winter in

1386
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,999
history this is uh very
contradictory

1387
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,999
very careful particularly when
it comes

1388
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,999
to children i was surprised by
his

1389
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,999
answer actually uh

1390
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,999
because you know

1391
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,999
it's just to me it's not an
acceptable

1392
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:26,999
answer 

1393
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,999
especially when it comes to
schools but

1394
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,999
a new cbs news poll finds that
most

1395
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:32,999
americans trust dr

1396
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,999
fauci though his unfavorable
rating

1397
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,999
among conservatives has

1398
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,999
increased since april the
country needs

1399
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:39,999
guidance 

1400
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,999
of the nation's best medical and

1401
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,999
scientific experts

1402
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,999
these literally are matters of
life and

1403
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,999
of death

1404
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,999
as democrats demand more
guidance from

1405
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,999
the federal government

1406
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,999
today the administration's
former top

1407
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,999
vaccine researcher rick bright

1408
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,999
will testify before house
committee that

1409
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,999
if the response is not

1410
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,999
ramped up 2020 will be the
darkest

1411
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,999
winter in modern history

1412
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,999
i think cbs does a good job of
wrapping

1413
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,999
up the messaging that they want

1414
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,999
trump bad fouchy good

1415
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,999
it's the exact same messaging
that pbs

1416
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,999
is using

1417
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,999
the obs has been going to they
had

1418
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,999
shields and brooks on and they
went on

1419
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,999
and on

1420
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,999
well let's hear it let's hear
it i want

1421
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,999
to hear it i want to hear what
you got

1422
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,999
well we got a few things here i
got a

1423
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,999
lot of stuff i'm biting but if

1424
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,999
you know well biden will come
let's

1425
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,999
finish up the rona let's do uh

1426
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,999
shields and brooks on pbs
research notes

1427
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,999
uh and it reveals that joe
biden is a

1428
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,999
very transparent person the

1429
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,999
the culture they describe is
certainly

1430
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,999
the culture i knew when i was

1431
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,999
covering senator biden go to

1432
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,999
go to uh shields on reopening
seas

1433
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,999
battle pbs

1434
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,999
president and he said it again
today uh

1435
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,999
we need to move ahead

1436
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,999
uh whether we're ready or not
on the you

1437
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,999
know in the direction of
opening up

1438
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,999
yes he did judy and the
president proves

1439
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,999
once again

1440
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,999
he's not actually strategic or
tactical

1441
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,999
in his political

1442
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,999
uh fights that he engages in uh
he's

1443
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:09,999
he's visceral

1444
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,999
uh he's instinctive he went out
you

1445
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,999
should always if you're going
after

1446
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,999
somebody politically stop go
after

1447
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,999
somebody 

1448
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,999
we're gonna have to start this
over

1449
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,999
because you gotta listen to
what he

1450
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,999
did she she says trump wants to
go ahead

1451
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,999
and reopen the country

1452
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,999
and he this is like this
messaging that

1453
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,999
you just brought up on cbs and
it's also

1454
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,999
being played

1455
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,999
out on pbs and elsewhere it's
as though

1456
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,999
the 

1457
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,999
the overlying talking points
the message

1458
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:35,999
of something else

1459
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,999
sneaks in as a as a given

1460
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,999
conversations that where it
shouldn't so

1461
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,999
she's asking them to

1462
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,999
the president wants to reopen
the

1463
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,999
country and his response is

1464
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,999
he doesn't know how to pick his
battles

1465
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,999
he's not strategic

1466
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,999
wait a minute he wants to
reopen the

1467
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,999
country is not a battle

1468
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,999
who's a battle with who well we
know

1469
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,999
it's assumed they already know
what the

1470
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,999
battle is it's a battle between
fauci

1471
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,999
and trump because they want to
lower

1472
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,999
trump's numbers

1473
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,999
he put somebody else you know
that

1474
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,999
called the shots and helped
continue

1475
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,999
ruin the country

1476
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,999
and so the world not just the
country

1477
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,999
the world yeah the world the
world yeah

1478
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,999
the one world world government
will take

1479
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,999
care of that although although
every

1480
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,999
country has their own fauci

1481
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,999
yes every country has their own
fauci

1482
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:23,999
yeah 

1483
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,999
all connected own saucy got got
pictures

1484
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,999
of fauci on the background on
their desk

1485
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:29,999
man 

1486
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,999
they're all fouchy's disciples
disciples

1487
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,999
the pope disciples

1488
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,999
so you have this so we played
again this

1489
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,999
clip now that we have that yeah
you want

1490
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,999
to play it over here with it in
mind

1491
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,999
that what she says and what he
jumps in

1492
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:40,999
with is

1493
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,999
discrepant president and he
said it

1494
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,999
again today

1495
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,999
uh we need to move ahead uh
whether

1496
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,999
we're ready or not on

1497
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,999
the you know in the direction
of opening

1498
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,999
up yes he did judy and

1499
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,999
the president proves once again
he's not

1500
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,999
actually strategic or tactical
in his

1501
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,999
political 

1502
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,999
uh fights that he engages in uh
he's

1503
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:01,999
visceral uh

1504
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,999
he's instinctive he went out
you should

1505
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,999
always if you're going after
somebody

1506
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,999
politically 

1507
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,999
go after somebody who's a lot
weaker

1508
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,999
than you are politically or
less popular

1509
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,999
i mean democrats won five
consecutive

1510
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,999
presidential elections

1511
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,999
running against uh herbert
hoover uh

1512
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,999
because of their the depression
and

1513
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,999
unpopular as the republican
president

1514
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,999
but he picked anthony fauci dr
fauci uh

1515
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,999
david mentioned it's been been
there

1516
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,999
since the reagan years

1517
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,999
but not only that when in a
presidential

1518
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,999
debate when george

1519
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,999
h.w bush was asked to cite a

1520
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,999
contemporary american hero

1521
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,999
he cited dr anthony fauci

1522
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,999
what a hero not anymore in my
book

1523
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,999
and now remember the in order
to get

1524
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:45,999
back to work

1525
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,999
it really is about nine things
testing

1526
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,999
testing testing

1527
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,999
tracing tracing tracing
isolation

1528
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,999
isolation isolation so we got
to test

1529
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,999
you we've got to trace you
we've got to

1530
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,999
isolate you

1531
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,999
and i have been identifying
along with

1532
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,999
some of our no agenda

1533
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,999
lab personnel that the antibody

1534
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,999
tests are increasingly
difficult to put

1535
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,999
together 

1536
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,999
the the material they're
receiving from

1537
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,999
i'm not sure where it comes
from i think

1538
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,999
some of it if not all from china

1539
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,999
seems to be faulty uh not the
same

1540
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,999
results 

1541
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,999
and this is the this is what
certainly

1542
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,999
the um

1543
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,999
a lot of people want and and
feel is

1544
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,999
necessary to go back to work is
we have

1545
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,999
to test for the antibodies

1546
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,999
and obviously the leading group

1547
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,999
on the test for antibodies is
run by who

1548
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,999
else could it be

1549
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,999
the gates foundation it's not
really run

1550
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,999
by them but

1551
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,999
they're a major funder of this
group and

1552
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,999
the fba has stepped in

1553
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,999
the food and drug
administration halted

1554
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,999
a coronavirus testing program
promoted

1555
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,999
by billionaire bill gates and
seattle

1556
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,999
health officials pending reviews

1557
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,999
the program sought to send test
kits to

1558
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,999
the home of people both healthy
and sick

1559
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,999
to try to bring the country to
the level

1560
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,999
of testing officials say is
necessary

1561
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,999
before states can begin safely
reopening

1562
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,999
the program which has already
gone

1563
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,999
through thousands of tests
found dozens

1564
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:07,999
of cases that had previously
been

1565
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,999
undiagnosed 

1566
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,999
the seattle coronavirus
assessment

1567
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,999
network said on its website
that the fda

1568
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,999
has asked it to pause testing
while it

1569
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,999
receives additional
authorizations but

1570
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,999
maintained its procedures are
safe

1571
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,999
the story is so underplayed
that you

1572
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,999
can't even get a clip you have
to get a

1573
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,999
computer voice

1574
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,999
reading the copy you know it's
from

1575
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:27,999
money that computer voice

1576
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,999
sounds like another one of
these online

1577
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,999
commentators bill still

1578
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,999
oh yeah really i had to put i
had to cut

1579
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,999
it to put pauses in to make the

1580
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,999
transition 

1581
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,999
natural and so bad but that's
how how

1582
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,999
under-reported this is nobody

1583
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,999
nobody wants to really let you
know that

1584
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,999
it's failing

1585
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,999
meanwhile without a doubt
science-based

1586
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,999
science-based 

1587
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,999
new york has some great ideas
for

1588
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,999
getting back to work

1589
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,999
and new york has problems but

1590
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,999
they do want people to at least
go back

1591
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,999
and play some tennis

1592
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,999
every player unless they're
from the

1593
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,999
same household has to bring
their own

1594
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,999
tennis balls

1595
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,999
so that you don't touch other
people's

1596
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,999
tennis balls

1597
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,999
with your hands you can kick
their balls

1598
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,999
but you can't

1599
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,999
touch them okay is that iso
worthy

1600
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,999
you can kick their balls but
you can't

1601
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,999
touch them

1602
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,999
it gets it gets it gets better
because

1603
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,999
she recognizes what she's doing
and

1604
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,999
this is our humorous moment of
the show

1605
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,999
with your hands you can kick
their balls

1606
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,999
but you can't touch them

1607
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,999
i'm gonna blush sorry um of
course if

1608
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:39,999
you're 

1609
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,999
if you're playing with someone
in your

1610
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,999
household you can't touch those
tennis

1611
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,999
balls 

1612
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,999
uh to avoid convince to avoid
confusion

1613
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:49,999
between 

1614
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:57,999
who's 

1615
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,999
i give her high marks for that
hi marx

1616
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,999
i love it that everyone's
cracking up we

1617
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,999
just needed that moment of like
oh okay

1618
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,999
okay okay okay i feel so much
better now

1619
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,999
you have to number the balls
like they

1620
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,999
do you got a number

1621
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,999
and the ball boys they can't be
grabbing

1622
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,999
everybody's balls they only can
only get

1623
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,999
the 

1624
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,999
balls on their side of the of
their from

1625
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,999
their team

1626
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,999
you can only touch your team's
balls it

1627
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,999
goes on forever obviously you
can have a

1628
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,999
lot of fun with this

1629
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,999
i have since it's uh

1630
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,999
also being um obfuscated

1631
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,999
i have an update from a new
york city

1632
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,999
nursing home

1633
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,999
where a good half of all of new
york's

1634
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,999
city patients

1635
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,999
died uh would you like to hear
this from

1636
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,999
a dude named

1637
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,999
ben who works in i.t from yeah
i love

1638
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,999
the uh yeah yeah so the the

1639
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,999
what we've been discussing and
what is

1640
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,999
death mill

1641
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,999
what is on our radar is the
fact that

1642
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,999
the governor signed a number of
orders

1643
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,999
which really put sick people
back into

1644
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,999
the 

1645
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,999
uh nursing homes without proper

1646
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,999
separation without

1647
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,999
not all of them but really
unprepared

1648
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:15,999
and that infected

1649
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,999
a lot of people and killed a
lot of

1650
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,999
people and he

1651
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,999
doesn't want to own up to it i
don't

1652
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,999
think he will

1653
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,999
uh i think i'm not blaming him

1654
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,999
specifically shit happens in an

1655
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,999
emergency this is not a good one

1656
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,999
but uh you know i don't want to
be

1657
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,999
to talk about the hypocritical
nature of

1658
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:33,999
it obviously we know if this was

1659
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,999
a republican who had done it
the media

1660
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,999
would have been talking about it

1661
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,999
but even even fox news isn't
really

1662
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,999
talking about this no one wants
to know

1663
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,999
so here's our report boots on
the ground

1664
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,999
dude named ben that's not
really his

1665
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,999
name but a

1666
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,999
dude named ben who works in i.t
for a

1667
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,999
large new york city nursing
home a few

1668
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,999
facts about how

1669
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,999
our governor cuomo has handled
this

1670
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,999
vulnerable population

1671
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:54,999
from the beginning we were told
by the

1672
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,999
government and new york state
department

1673
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:57,999
of health

1674
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,999
that we cannot test staff and
residents

1675
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,999
as there is not enough testing
supplies

1676
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,999
and hospitals are more important

1677
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,999
that's mistake number one the
only way

1678
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,999
we could test a patient was to
transfer

1679
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,999
them to the hospital then they
were

1680
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:11,999
tested 

1681
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,999
the only way we could test
staff is to

1682
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,999
have them go to their private
doctor

1683
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,999
get them to call the state
testing

1684
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,999
hotline and if symptomatic

1685
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,999
get an appointment for a
testing center

1686
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,999
therefore there was a very low
death

1687
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,999
rate reported by nursing homes
since

1688
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,999
they couldn't test

1689
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:27,999
and therefore could not confirm
the

1690
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,999
deaths were coveted 19 related

1691
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,999
then cuomo ordered all nursing
homes to

1692
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,999
accept kovid 19

1693
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,999
positive discharges that's
people from

1694
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:38,999
the hospital

1695
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,999
most nursing homes are
unprepared for

1696
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,999
this do not have sufficient

1697
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,999
ppe or staff ignore the ability
to

1698
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,999
isolate 

1699
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:48,999
we partnered at that time with
a large

1700
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,999
new york city hospital system
created a

1701
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,999
dedicated covet 19 recovery
unit and

1702
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,999
gladly accepted positive
patience

1703
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,999
patience once we put in place
the

1704
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,999
appropriate infection control
procedures

1705
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,999
and received sufficient ppe
from our

1706
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,999
hospital partner

1707
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,999
then cuomo woke up and realized
many

1708
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,999
nursing homes were not equipped
to

1709
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,999
handle covet 19 positive
patients and

1710
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,999
the death count went up and
issued

1711
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,999
another executive order

1712
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,999
for bidding nursing homes from
accepting

1713
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,999
covet 19 positive patients

1714
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,999
they will surely back up
hospitals and

1715
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,999
create an artificial surge

1716
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,999
then cuomo mandated this is
crazy that

1717
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,999
all nursing home patients and
staff be

1718
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,999
tested 

1719
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,999
we had a team of 20 from the
department

1720
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,999
of health here this week tested
all

1721
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,999
residents and staff over four
days we

1722
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:32,999
now have to put a plan

1723
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,999
in place by five by may 20th
how we're

1724
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,999
going to continue to test staff

1725
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:38,999
twice a week even though there
are not

1726
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,999
enough testing supplies lab
capacity

1727
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,999
logistical ability

1728
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,999
nurses and doctors to swab and
cost of

1729
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,999
millions of dollars per month
per

1730
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:47,999
facility will become a financial

1731
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,999
hardship 

1732
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,999
if we don't have a plan we risk
losing

1733
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,999
our license and i really don't
look

1734
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,999
forward to having my brain
poked an

1735
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,999
additional two times per week
going

1736
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,999
forward 

1737
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,999
you two are so spot on in much
of your

1738
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,999
analysis thank you for

1739
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,999
do to spread the truth
analyzing tissue

1740
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:02,999
stay safe keep your six foot
social

1741
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,999
distance figure out how to wear
a

1742
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,999
mastering haircuts thank you

1743
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,999
so again cuomo certainly but i
think in

1744
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:11,999
general 

1745
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,999
doesn't care about the elderly
doesn't

1746
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,999
care about old people cares
about the

1747
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,999
hospital 

1748
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,999
and the money that they can
make i'm

1749
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,999
just going to say that

1750
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,999
in the state and getting a
bailout he he

1751
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,999
does not like did not

1752
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,999
care for the actual people who
needed

1753
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,999
um no he's about the money yes

1754
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,999
and it's it's disturbing

1755
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:35,999
when you raise this disturbing
and so

1756
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,999
far he's like worshipped

1757
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,999
along with fauci by the
democrats and

1758
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,999
especially the

1759
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,999
the ones that kind of hope bite
and put

1760
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,999
moves aside so cuomo could take
over you

1761
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:46,999
know we've already

1762
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,999
shown on this show that that's
not even

1763
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,999
a possibility because

1764
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,999
cuomo's commentary where he says

1765
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,999
america's never been a great
country

1766
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:54,999
which is all you have to do is
just keep

1767
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,999
playing that audio forever and
then

1768
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,999
he's never going to get a vote
it's the

1769
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,999
dumbest thing anyone could ever
say

1770
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,999
yeah so as a politician i mean
people

1771
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,999
can say it

1772
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,999
right but but it's just
politicians all

1773
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,999
of it is just

1774
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,999
it's so sad and you were
arguing about

1775
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,999
the wrong

1776
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,999
things no one and the media of
course

1777
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,999
has not been your friend for

1778
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,999
a long long time but it's just
gotten so

1779
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,999
bad 

1780
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,999
very bad a lot of people get
notes from

1781
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,999
is saying that the media

1782
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:25,999
i mean the media has been bad
for a long

1783
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,999
time and we've documented for
the last

1784
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:28,999
10 years and then

1785
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,999
as we go back in history and go
back to

1786
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,999
the gulf of tonkin and those
other

1787
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:33,999
things that took place in the
media

1788
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,999
philip 

1789
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,999
fell off the of the side uh

1790
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,999
the media's never been any good
well

1791
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:41,999
and that was it was interesting
i was

1792
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,999
talking to the keeper about uh
the

1793
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,999
church um

1794
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,999
commission uh

1795
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,999
i think she said it it has it
always it

1796
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,999
always been like uh

1797
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,999
you know this indoctrination
into the

1798
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,999
media i said yeah in 75 there
was a big

1799
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,999
a big hearing the church
commission and

1800
01:00:59,000 --> 01:00:59,999
you know the cia sat there
saying yeah

1801
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,999
yeah we

1802
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,999
yeah we have people uh on staff
or who

1803
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,999
who send in

1804
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,999
stories to reporters in the
printed

1805
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,999
press and then the question
came in

1806
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,999
well do you have anybody at a
major

1807
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,999
television news network well
that had to

1808
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,999
be discussed in private setting

1809
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,999
yeah and the same for anyone at
the new

1810
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,999
york times well

1811
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:18,999
we think we should discuss that
in

1812
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,999
private settings so yes and if
you think

1813
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:20,999
it went away

1814
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,999
it did not so why would it

1815
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,999
no it's a good mechanism it
works well

1816
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,999
for them but

1817
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,999
unfortunately we're a lot of
people are

1818
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:31,999
welcome we're sucked into public

1819
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:32,999

1820
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,999
remember the the pennsylvania
secretary

1821
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,999

that

1822
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,999

secretary's

1823
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,999
appearance 

1824
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,999

appearance of the

1825
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,999

second yeah go on

cancelled 

1837

01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,999
peppers and at here in braddock

1842
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,999
super popular restaurant in our
region

1843
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,999
but portogallo is coming under
fire

1844
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,999
for recent facebook comments
that he

1845
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,999
posted on his personal page

1846
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,999
comments that some say are
transphobic

1847
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,999
these are the facebook posts
that robert

1848
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,999
portagalo shared on his page

1849
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,999
now what's interesting is what
you see

1850
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,999
is a picture of

1851
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,999
him with the wig on and looking
like uh

1852
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,999

the uh the

1853
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:46,999

next to each other above that
which i

1855
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,999
think was

1856
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,999
funny and the actual joke not
this is

1857
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:52,999
not a trans joke

1858
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,999

doesn't matter but no

1912
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,999
let's let's immediately take it
into all

1913
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,999
and by the way it's okay to
make fun of

1914
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,999
the president and his orange
hair

1915
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,999
orange man bad that's okay but
oh no

1916
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,999
oh no this immediately has to
be taken

1917
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,999
into lgbtq shut up

1918
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,999
so annoying

1919
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,999
yes uh the appearance uh bigotry

1920
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,999
needs to be consistent in uh in
texas

1921
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,999
you can mock the president for
being

1922
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,999
orange 

1923
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,999
uh or a clown or whatever you
want to

1924
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:14,999
call him uh

1925
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,999
let it be you're open it's open
game

1926
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:17,999
it's open so you can go after
anybody

1927
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,999
you'd think

1928
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,999
you'd think but no uh

1929
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,999
see yes so the final things i
have is

1930
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,999
what's going on locally here in
texas as

1931
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,999
um you know there's a lot of
pushback

1932
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,999
from people who want to open up

1933
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,999
and you know there's uh what
we're

1934
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:37,999
seeing now across the country

1935
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,999
is some of the more rigorous
mayors and

1936
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,999
or government more mayors than
anything

1937
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,999
but governors as well

1938
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,999
they will take away your
license so you

1939
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,999
can't operate

1940
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,999
you know doing anything to
shame you or

1941
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,999
thwart you from

1942
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,999
conducting your business
legally which

1943
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,999
you know

1944
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,999
it's legal is this is not a
violation of

1945
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,999
law it's a violation of some
kind of

1946
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,999
social standards that we're now

1947
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,999
tied into so in texas we have
the

1948
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,999
traveling economic militias

1949
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,999
and this is this is new

1950
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,999
these guys are going all over
texas

1951
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,999
and they are protecting
businesses

1952
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,999
that want to open up and they
stand in

1953
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,999
front with their rifles

1954
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,999
and of course all kinds of
intimidating

1955
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,999
looking gear and you know what

1956
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,999
businesses are open and that i
think is

1957
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,999
sad that it has to go that way

1958
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,999
i like it i'd like to think
it's great

1959
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,999
that it has to go that way

1960
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,999
and perfectly and you know i
would

1961
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:36,999
participate in in that if

1962
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,999
if someone was having problems
i'd jump

1963
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:39,999
right in and stand there no
one's gonna

1964
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,999
this is why we have guns

1965
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,999
when this type of situation
appears

1966
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:45,999
let's look at a country

1967
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,999
that just took away their guns
in new

1968
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,999
zealand 

1969
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:49,999
and let's see what kind of
powers

1970
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,999
they've given to their prime
minister

1971
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,999
this bill enables the police to
enter a

1972
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,999
home 

1973
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,999
without a warrant madam speaker
the

1974
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,999
police have never

1975
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,999
held that power at all

1976
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,999
they have never held that power
and this

1977
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:06,999
bill 

1978
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,999
this bill enables police just on

1979
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,999

2008
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:09,999
wuhan institute

2009
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,999
of virology has come under
scrutiny as a

2010
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,999
potential source of the virus

2011
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,999
according to an nbc report a
hazardous

2012
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:16,999
event 

2013
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,999
may have happened at the lab in
october

2014
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:20,999
last year

2015
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,999
three people familiar with the
matter

2016
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,999
told nbc that u.s intelligence
agencies

2017
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:25,999
are reviewing an

2018
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,999
unofficial report on cell phone
location

2019
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,999
data the report found there was
no cell

2020
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,999
phone activity around the high
security

2021
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:33,999
part of the p4 lab

2022
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,999
between october 7th and 24th
last year

2023
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,999
the report suggests there may
have been

2024
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:40,999
a hazardous event

2025
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,999
there sometime between october
6th and

2026
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:43,999
11th 

2027
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,999
that required the lab to be
closed

2028
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,999
during that time

2029
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,999
the report talks about images
from

2030
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,999
october 14th to 19

2031
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,999
last year showing no outbound
traffic

2032
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:54,999
from the lab

2033
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,999
it's suspected a roadblock was
set up to

2034
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:57,999
prevent cars and people

2035
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,999
coming and going this is in
contrast to

2036
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,999
satellite images from august to
october

2037
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:03,999
6 

2038
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,999
which show a lot of activity
the next

2039
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,999
instance of activity was on
october 25th

2040
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,999
u.s senator tom cotton also
spoke about

2041
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,999
the data in an interview with
fox news

2042
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,999
cotton said normally thousands
of mobile

2043
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,999
phones are in use around this
area

2044
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,999
wuhan has about the same
population

2045
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,999
density as new york

2046
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:24,999
he adds the sudden drop in cell
phone

2047
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,999
usage is likely an indicator of
when the

2048
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,999
virus first began spreading

2049
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,999
he said we could get to the
bottom of it

2050
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,999
a lot faster if the chinese
regime was

2051
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,999
more transparent

2052
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,999
us intelligence officials say
the

2053
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,999
evidence is not enough on its
own

2054
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,999
they are still investigating
now where

2055
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,999
did this report come from

2056
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,999
this came from a news operation
called

2057
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,999
ntd 

2058
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,999
which is chinese operation uh
an ntd

2059
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:52,999
center new

2060
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,999
tang dynasty and it turns out
that these

2061
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:56,999
are the same

2062
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,999
group that comes out of the uh
like the

2063
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,999
epoch the epoch times uh right
right

2064
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,999
right right right right same
operation

2065
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,999
yeah that's uh they they hate
the

2066
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:09,999
chinese 

2067
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:10,999
obviously they hate the chinese
was

2068
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,999
falun gong yeah that's falun
gong or

2069
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,999
banned in china and it was uh
and i will

2070
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:16,999
be writing an essay

2071
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,999
about this because the following

2072
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,999
phenomenon is quite interesting
this

2073
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,999
operation only began in the 90s

2074
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,999
there was a uh a moment there
was a

2075
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,999
moment in history where this uh

2076
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:28,999
there's all these different
movement

2077
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,999
practices in china

2078
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,999
and uh chi gong it was one of
them that

2079
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,999
goes back i think three or three

2080
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,999
thousand years at least and it
became

2081
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:38,999
for some unknown reason

2082
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,999
a super popular again it began
its

2083
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,999
popularity began in the 50s and
then it

2084
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:44,999
got 

2085
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,999
incredibly popular in the 90s
and it's

2086
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:48,999
like tai chi

2087
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,999
chi gong there's a bunch of
these are

2088
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:51,999
all interconnected and gong
also this is

2089
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:52,999
like 

2090
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,999
kung so kung fu all these
different

2091
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:55,999
movement 

2092
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,999
uh ideologies are part of
chinese

2093
01:10:59,000 --> 01:10:59,999
culture 

2094
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,999
and in the mid 90s this qi gong
is

2095
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,999
extremely popular and they in an

2096
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:05,999
offshoot called

2097
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,999
fallon gong came up and became

2098
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,999
so popular so quickly that it
garnered

2099
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,999
like 70 million followers
within a

2100
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,999
couple of years

2101
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,999
and by the end of the same
decade it was

2102
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,999
banned in china because it was
seen as

2103
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:20,999
dangerous 

2104
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,999
yeah and then ever since then
it's been

2105
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,999
this this blood feud between
these uh

2106
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,999
these people in the chinese
communist

2107
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:28,999
party 

2108
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,999
i'm glad you uh you went into
that and

2109
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,999
and whenever i see

2110
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,999
you know the epoch times i bear
that in

2111
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,999
mind they have an agenda but i
think a

2112
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:38,999
lot of people don't even know
this don't

2113
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,999
even know that

2114
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:40,999
it's epoch times and what else
what's

2115
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,999
the other online thing well
this one

2116
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:43,999
here is ntdd there's a new
service

2117
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,999
there's also something else
called

2118
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,999
happy morning or something
they're doing

2119
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:49,999
happy endings

2120
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,999
this ntd stands for new tang
dynasty

2121
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,999
oh and the tang dynasty is
interesting

2122
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,999
because that's the one that
took place

2123
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,999
between about 600 and 900

2124
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,999
uh very early and or early in
modern

2125
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:02,999
chinese history

2126
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,999
and that there was a 300 year
reign with

2127
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,999
a with a hole in the middle of

2128
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,999
it where the evil empress woo

2129
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,999
oh we ruled that little era it
was the

2130
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:14,999
only full uh

2131
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,999
empress in the history of china
that

2132
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,999
actually had total complete
power

2133
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,999
that was and she was evil she
was a

2134
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,999
whore apparently who somehow
got into

2135
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:23,999
government 

2136
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,999
and which does happen now was
that

2137
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,999
before before the wu-tan clang
or uh

2138
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,999
a little bit before just before
the clan

2139
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,999
all right whoo little chinese
system

2140
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:37,999
a little bit of history for
everybody

2141
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,999
the stuff this stuff has its

2142
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,999
implications and this

2143
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,999
these uh these falun gong guys
have got

2144
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,999
some very serious this is a good

2145
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:45,999
journalism they've

2146
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,999
been producing to be honest
about it i

2147
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,999
mean i know it's slanted too
but it's

2148
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,999
pretty well done well all news
is

2149
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,999
slanted but you still have to
pick out

2150
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:55,999
what you can as long as you
know what's

2151
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,999
going on

2152
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,999
this story about the lab
getting shut

2153
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,999
down which has been debunked

2154
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,999
of course having something to
do with it

2155
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,999
is uh not being played by
anybody and

2156
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,999
and it apparently nbc did have
the story

2157
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,999
but they kind of they got
crushed

2158
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,999
so what is your takeaway with
that then

2159
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:12,999
the still the

2160
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,999
virus came from the chinese lab
i think

2161
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,999
just like the french guy the
french

2162
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,999
nobel prize winner in medicine
who

2163
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,999
discovered the aids virus

2164
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,999
is the guy who's i think is
right and

2165
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:24,999
they all call it everyone calls
them a

2166
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:25,999
crackpot 

2167
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,999
and now yes now they do it's
like got

2168
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,999
his nobel prize he's got his

2169
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,999
his chops yet he's a crackpot
this is

2170
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:34,999
happening 

2171
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,999
yeah this is happening
everywhere in the

2172
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:38,999
netherlands 

2173
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,999
there's a very famous
statistician and

2174
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,999
pollster his name is maurice
duhont

2175
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,999
and that translates
interestingly to

2176
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,999
maurice the dog

2177
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,999
that is that is literally his
name and

2178
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:51,999
maurice 

2179
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,999
he's probably he's got 10 years
on me

2180
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,999
i've i've worked with him in
the past

2181
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,999
but he's very famous he's the
guy that

2182
01:13:59,000 --> 01:13:59,999
whenever there's elections he's

2183
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,999
everywhere on television

2184
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,999
he tells he shows everybody the
charts

2185
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,999
the numbers he's got it all
down he's

2186
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,999
very good at

2187
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:07,999
understanding data and he's
been doing

2188
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,999
it since i was a child

2189
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,999
almost in the country watching
him he

2190
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:13,999
has been

2191
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,999
shut out entirely banned from
all

2192
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,999
mainstream 

2193
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,999
and he's now appearing on
podcasts and

2194
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,999
i'm actually

2195
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:22,999
considering because he speaks
perfect

2196
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,999
english i'm i'm uh considering

2197
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,999
doing an interview with him
because it's

2198
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,999
easy to get right now

2199
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,999
and and it's because he said
look uh

2200
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,999
the way you're collecting the
data is

2201
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,999
shoddy you have completely

2202
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,999
incorrect data the numbers are
no good

2203
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,999
your models are no good goodbye

2204
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,999
maurice the dog so it happens

2205
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,999
it's happening everywhere
france has got

2206
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:45,999

01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,999
maurice de jong i think his
career is

2208
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,999
over not that he you know he
has i'm

2209
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:50,999
sure he's plenty of money

2210
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,999
but it's it's odd to see the
guy that i

2211
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,999
grew up watching is the
authority on

2212
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,999
data and statistics and numbers
to be

2213
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,999
completely shut out because he
had a

2214
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,999
different opinion

2215
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,999

handcuffs as

the last few months of your
virus

2407
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,999
deconstruction has been

2408
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,999
the best i wanted to give you
an update

2409
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,999
from the front line here in
japan we

2410
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:39,999
have dodged the bullets so far
and have

2411
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,999
only 739 deaths

2412
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,999
for a population of over 126
million

2413
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,999
that's 5.8 deaths per million
compared

2414
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:49,999
that to the us

2415
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,999
with 267 deaths per million of
course

2416
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:54,999
that includes people who drink

2417
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,999
themselves to death

2418
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,999
and the uk with 511 deaths per
million

2419
01:22:00,000 --> 01:21:59,999
which is

2420
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,999
definitely people who drink
themselves

2421
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,999
to death japan is an incredible
100

2422
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,999
times less than the uk

2423
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,999
we have that i'm curious they
must be i

2424
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,999
bet you the japanese are
accurate with

2425
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:10,999
their diagnosis

2426
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,999
of death the cause of death do
what do

2427
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,999
you think

2428
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:15,999
i would agree with i have a
feeling that

2429
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,999
this is the japanese are known
for

2430
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:18,999
precision 

2431
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,999
yeah yeah and everything
apparently

2432
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,999
everything has to have a stamp
and an

2433
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:24,999
approval so they're not going
to mess

2434
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,999
with it alex is such a good car

2435
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,999
the ones made in japan yes

2436
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,999
is it is that why the lexus is
such a

2437
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,999
good car is that it

2438
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,999
it's one of the reasons uh okay
now uh

2439
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:37,999
back to uh

2440
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,999
masks and he says we've been
doing it

2441
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,999
right yeah masks work the whole
country

2442
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,999
wears them for flu season every
year

2443
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,999
especially the most crowded
mass transit

2444
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:46,999
system in the world you wear
them so you

2445
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:47,999
don't give

2446
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,999
your cold to others and people
have been

2447
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:50,999
doing this for years and it's
no big

2448
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,999
deal no stigma

2449
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,999
attached it's also meant that
we had oh

2450
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:56,999
it's also

2451
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,999
important that we had more
stock yeah

2452
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,999
several billions of them there
was

2453
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,999
just enough to go around mass
usage went

2454
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,999
up with cobit but it also meant
that it

2455
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:05,999
was the weakest flu season

2456
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:06,999
over 10 years and we went
through the

2457
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,999
hotels that he spoke about

2458
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,999
contact tracing is big here not

2459
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,999
electronic just lots of leg
work all the

2460
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:13,999
resources have been put

2461
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,999
uh on that and uh on let me

2462
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,999
put on that and on phones in
mass

2463
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,999
transit oh no i'm sorry and on
tracking

2464
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:23,999
coveted clusters we might have
been

2465
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,999
lucky getting a weaker strain
but it

2466
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,999
helps not having to shake hands
just bow

2467
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,999
no huggy kissy greetings no
talking on

2468
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:31,999
phones in mass transit

2469
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,999
hand sanitizers almost
everywhere high

2470
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:34,999
adoption of touchless

2471
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,999
electronic payment systems as
well as

2472
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,999
burner cards

2473
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:39,999
finally the healthcare system
here has a

2474
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,999
low barrier to entry my kids
can go to

2475
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,999
the local doctor themselves

2476
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,999
just take their national health
card mom

2477
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:46,999
might rock up later very much

2478
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,999
neighborhood policing system
well yes

2479
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,999
it's a very sophisticated

2480
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,999
disciplined society which has a
lot of

2481
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,999
downsides too

2482
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,999
the kids get a feeling for
what's going

2483
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:58,999
on it's by no means perfect the

2484
01:23:59,000 --> 01:23:59,999
prevention 

2485
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,999
testing measures can be seen as
flawed

2486
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,999
the reporting flaw japan is
flawed

2487
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,999
but all the micro actions
combined make

2488
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,999
it a rather safe place to be
right now

2489
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:08,999
there's a lot to be learned
from this

2490
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,999
fuzzy logic and staying calm
sir mark

2491
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,999

01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:02,999
so does he

2512
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:03,999
uh these on the i think they're
both on

2513
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:04,999
the birthday unless you might
want to

2514
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,999
check yeah here's an update on
what's

2515
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,999
going on with the medical ppe
it's ties

2516
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:09,999
to some of the

2517
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,999
kaylee cayley mcinanni

2518
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,999
quotes that are making the
rounds one of

2519
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,999
my manufacturing sites produces

2520
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,999
layers used in n95 surgical
masks

2521
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,999
here's a part of what i think
has been

2522
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,999
going on with the lockdown and
how ppe

2523
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:27,999
played a role

2524
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,999
one a one as the covet hit the
u.s we

2525
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,999
started summarizing more
clearly what we

2526
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,999
knew about the industry

2527
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,999
we guessed that the u.s would
make about

2528
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,999
6 million n95 masks per day

2529
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:43,999
and the government was supposed
to have

2530
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,999
a stockpile of 90 million based
on 2000

2531
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,999
on a 2004 paper but when
created there

2532
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,999
was never more than 85 million
at the

2533
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,999
start of the rona it had about
12

2534
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:53,999
million 

2535
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,999
as an example california's
first request

2536
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,999
was for 20 million

2537
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,999
in late february hhs said 90
million was

2538
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:01,999
wrong 

2539
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:02,999
the correct number should have
been a

2540
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,999
330 million

2541
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,999
seven days later hhs says the
right

2542
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,999
number was really

2543
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,999
3.5 billion as we've dealt with
the

2544
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,999
military via the defense
production act

2545
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:17,999
my guess is that the military
and the

2546
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,999
rest of the us government did
the same

2547
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,999
math and realize that the whole

2548
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,999
situation was hopelessly out of
whack

2549
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,999
wait we can make how many masks
that's

2550
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,999
not enough

2551
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,999
at this point the nature with
the nature

2552
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,999
of the disease being very
unclear the

2553
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:33,999
best option was to simply

2554
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,999
shut things down and give the
supply

2555
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,999
chain time to get caught up

2556
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,999
masks and pp will be part of the

2557
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,999
national the meanwhile you can

2558
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,999
impeach trump over this of
course of

2559
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:45,999
course mass and pp would be
part of

2560
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,999
national defense strategy going
forward

2561
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:47,999
there's 

2562
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,999
hoping that the rumored bill
that is a

2563
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:51,999
version of the barrie amendment
for

2564
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,999
medical supplies is passed soon
the

2565
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,999
barrie amendment is the
legislation that

2566
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:56,999
requires the military

2567
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,999
to buy certain items from
producers in

2568
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,999
the continental u.s

2569
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,999
kayleigh mcnamara makame uh

2570
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,999
had a great quote in the recent
briefing

2571
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,999
furthermore what crimson

2572
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,999
contagion brought us in that
president

2573
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,999
trump was right all along

2574
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,999
about misguided economic and
trade

2575
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,999
policies that left america
vulnerable to

2576
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:19,999
pandemics 

2577
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:20,999
well not too vulnerable to
pandemic but

2578
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,999
vulnerable 

2579
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,999
due to a pandemic

2580
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,999

kaylee mcananny

2585
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:38,999

time she's

01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:39,999
ever been mentioned in a
donation

2587
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,999
segment the first two times

2588
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:43,999
he donates again you can assume
it's

2589
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,999
going to happen one more time
here's

2590
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:46,999

support 

2595
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,999
once you read this one while i
look for

2596
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,999
uh the one after that yeah this
is from

2597
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,999
producer jacob

2598
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,999
333 and he says it's jacob your
favorite

2599
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:07,999
lobbyist 

2600
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,999
yes this is one of our lobbyist

2601
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,999
producers 

2602
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,999
amy wrongfully said that would
be

2603
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,999
probably one of your clips

2604
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,999
that quote corporate lobbying
firms are

2605
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,999
being oh that's right we talked
about

2606
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:20,999
the corporate lobbying firms
being

2607
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,999
bailed out she's wrong there's
no

2608
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:23,999
bailout provision for lobbyists
i think

2609
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,999
we explain that but

2610
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,999
he says people should not
misinterpret

2611
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,999
what that means lobbying firms
including

2612
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:31,999
our own are making

2613
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,999
all-time high profits thanks to
the

2614
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,999
abundance of new bailout

2615
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,999
uh slash appropriations bills

2616
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,999
the biggest problem love this
the

2617
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:42,999
biggest problem will be

2618
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,999
a lack of lobbyists next year
because so

2619
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,999
many will retire

2620
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,999
following this year of record
profits

2621
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,999
the states can't believe that
shit the

2622
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,999

2625
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,999
are coming next and will likely
include

2626
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,999

2680
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,999
almost 10 years ago a big nutty

2681
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,999
as as bug nutty as i am lately i

2682
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,999
shuddered to think how much
crazier i

2683
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:03,999

2684
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,999

wrecks 

2686
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,999
uh i'd started to think how
much crazier

2687
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,999
i'd be without your show and the

i don't know well what i
appreciate the

2778
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:20,999
most of the

2779
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:21,999
of the shows we've done in the
past

2780
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,999
couple months is is people
feeding back

2781
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:23,999
just like

2782
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,999
dame jennifer said no matter
what it is

2783
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:27,999
people seem to find

2784
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,999
some comfort in listening to us
and i'm

2785
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,999
i'm proud and happy about that
but

2786
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,999
i want to thank everybody
because it's

2787
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,999
really it's the producers

2788
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,999
long ago we noticed that it's
better to

2789
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,999
have producers than listeners

2790
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,999
because they actually do stuff
and

2791
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,999
produce and make things happen
there's

2792
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:46,999
no way this show would be what
it is

2793
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,999
without you without the people
who

2794
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,999
support us financially the clips

2795
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,999
thank you extra thanks to so
many

2796
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:53,999
producers who are sending

2797
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,999
uh if you send a youtube video
pre-cued

2798
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,999
with the time code it saves so
much time

2799
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,999
thank you listings of time codes

2800
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:03,999

incredibly appreciated uh

2802
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:08,999
because that's what it is and
that's why

2803
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:09,999

universe

2804
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,999
end of story these people

2805
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,999
of course are executive
producers and

2806
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:14,999
associate executive producers
and they

2807
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:15,999
can 

2808
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,999
um use these credits wherever
they want

2809
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,999
to because they're official

2810
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:20,999
and when people see a credit
they

2811
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,999
recognize it it gives you
stature

2812
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,999
and maybe a gig which is what a
lot of

01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,999
and so every time biden moved
you know

2868
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,999
his head stayed there on one
side and it

2869
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,999
became a skeleton head and it
was

2870
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,999
oh it was the worst yeah but
but before

2871
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,999
they we play that i do have
this one

2872
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:45,999
a clip i want to get out of the
way

2873
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,999
which is biden uh

2874
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,999
and apparently he was on um

2875
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,999
they were talking about him
scarborough

2876
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,999
and what's her name mika or

2877
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,999
mika brazil discussing biden's

2878
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,999
commentary when he was on gma
and i'm

2879
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:03,999
going to play this clip because
the

2880
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,999
combination of biden

2881
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,999
telling why he's hiding biden's
height

2882
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,999
and he's in his basement scared
to death

2883
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,999
and the two of them are going
on and on

2884
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,999
about how great it is because
he's a

2885
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:15,999
winner 

2886
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,999
now you know everybody says you
know

2887
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:18,999
biden's hiding well let me tell
you

2888
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:19,999
something 

2889
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,999
we're doing very well we're
we're we're

2890
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:23,999
following 

2891
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,999
the guidelines of the medical
profession

2892
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:26,999
we're 

2893
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,999
following the guidelines of the
experts

2894
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:29,999
the dr faucis of the world

2895
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,999
we're doing very well and that
matter of

2896
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,999
fact we're

2897
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:34,999
winning if you look at all the
polling

2898
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,999
data i'm not saying that's
going to last

2899
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:37,999
until november i don't know
enough to

2900
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:38,999
know that

2901
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,999
but right now the idea that
somehow we

2902
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,999
are being hurt by

2903
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,999
my keeping to the rules and
following

2904
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:45,999
the instructions

2905
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,999
that are uh that have been put
forward

2906
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,999
by the docs uh

2907
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,999
is absolutely bizarre i reject
the

2908
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:52,999
premise that somehow

2909
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,999
this is hurting us there's no
evidence

2910
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:55,999
of that

2911
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,999
i'm following the rules
following the

2912
01:38:59,000 --> 01:38:59,999
rules the president should
follow the

2913
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,999
rules instead of showing up at
places

2914
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,999
without masking the whole

2915
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,999
the whole thing i'm sorry he
wins that

2916
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:06,999
yeah 

2917
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,999
every time check me he wins that

2918
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:09,999
checkmate 

2919
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,999
every time yeah you know really
i i

2920
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,999
you i i understand the
president and

2921
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,999
people some people inside the
white

2922
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:18,999
house most of them understand
they're

2923
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,999
whistling past a political
graveyard but

2924
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,999
you know donald trump snubbing
doctors

2925
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:24,999
doctor's 

2926
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,999
advice in the middle of the
pandemic

2927
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:27,999
that's killed now

2928
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,999
over 80 000 people we have new
estimates

2929
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:31,999
it's going to kill

2930
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,999
140 150 000 people after donald
trump

2931
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,999
yeah whatever doctor's advice
early on

2932
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,999
and said this was nothing to
worry about

2933
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,999
he loses to a dude

2934
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,999
who says hey i'm gonna follow
the doc's

2935
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:45,999
advice 

2936
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,999
because guess what most
americans

2937
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,999
are following their doc's advice

2938
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,999
following advice to the doctor
so

2939
01:39:53,000 --> 01:40:00,999

2996
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,999
2013 episode

2997
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,999
512. so this is quite a while
ago of the

2998
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,999
no agenda show this is what
happened is

2999
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:29,999
that 

3000
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:30,999
that's not going to happen is
that that

3001
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,999
is the dream yeah that is

3002
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,999
i think it's called a
hallucination i

3003
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:35,999
had 

3004
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,999
i had a real dream last night
and i woke

3005
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:39,999
up from this

3006
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:40,999
put this in the red book just
for just

3007
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,999
for yucks

3008
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,999
all right i and it was vivid
okay

3009
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,999
it was vivid and maybe because
we've

3010
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,999
played a couple of clips of him
recently

3011
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,999
i've been watching video of him

3012
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,999
are you ready for this joe
biden was

3013
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,999
president 

3014
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,999
i am from the future ladies and

3015
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:00,999
gentlemen 

3016
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,999
i am from the future it's in
the red

3017
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:05,999
book i think

3018
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,999
you should be able to find that
it'll be

3019
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:09,999
a disaster

3020
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,999
all right so we have brian
giving his

3021
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,999
little event i got i got some

3022
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,999
miscellaneous clips and then
some some

3023
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:16,999
research on him

3024
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,999
okay um let's go with the biden
event

3025
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,999
clips i got

3026
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,999
uh i know i got three of them i
got

3027
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:27,999
anyone you want to play i can
play the

3028
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,999
short little one which i think
is

3029
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:30,999
similar to the

3030
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,999
pandemic when this biden's
event with

3031
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:33,999
the govs blather

3032
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,999
exists because you know in a
few nations

3033
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,999
that every major crisis we've
faced in

3034
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:39,999
our history

3035
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,999
has been in a situation where
we have uh

3036
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,999
come out stronger come out
stronger and

3037
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:46,999
uh what i'm finding

3038
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,999
and maybe go back to this later
but uh

3039
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,999
i'm finding that

3040
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,999
you know uh this whole crisis
sort of

3041
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,999
taking the blinders off

3042
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,999
most people you know the people
who

3043
01:43:59,000 --> 01:43:59,999
weren't are there geese in the

3044
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,999
background 

3045
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,999
yes necessarily prejudice but
just

3046
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,999
didn't focus

3047
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:06,999
that's the geese you hear in the

3048
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,999
background the little pond out
here

3049
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,999
and those canadian geese are
trying to

3050
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,999
get away from the buyers anyway

3051
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,999
all kidding aside what happens
is that

3052
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:16,999
uh um

3053
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,999
what i'm finding people who are

3054
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,999
constantly calling me and i know

3055
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,999
we're all in place but we have
on the

3056
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:23,999
phone 

3057
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,999
probably six hours a day or
people are

3058
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:27,999
talking about how

3059
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,999
they didn't realize that it was
somebody

3060
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,999
making you know

3061
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,999
seven bucks an hour is making
had their

3062
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:34,999
back you know

3063
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,999
by the time he got to the end i
had no

3064
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,999
idea what he was talking about

3065
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,999
exactly 

3066
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,999
exactly that was the point of
that clip

3067
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,999
yeah well it worked

3068
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,999
and there's a little sub clip
here this

3069
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,999
is biden event with the govs
blather

3070
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,999
one w-a-h-o

3071
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,999
yeah i got it we've got and i
know you

3072
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:57,999
all stand for that we got a lot
of

3073
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:58,999
ground to cover

3074
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,999
so let's start with this you
know that

3075
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,999
iris can hit anyone but it

3076
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,999
doesn't affect every community
oh shoot

3077
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,999
oh no i disconnected my head
you know i

3078
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:11,999
got a real problem with these
headphones

3079
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,999
and i'm not going to hear you
for at

3080
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:13,999
least 

3081
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,999
seven seconds so you can fill
up the

3082
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:16,999
void while i'm waiting well
that was

3083
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:17,999
important 

3084
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,999
that was a classic example of
both how

3085
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,999
stupid this event was this is
widened

3086
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,999
three governors but the lousy
connection

3087
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,999
none of them could none of them
in fact

3088
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,999
all three plus biden couldn't
talk for

3089
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,999
at all they were all

3090
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,999
i like you said iris now

3091
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,999

excuses or deflections or

3131
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,999
blame game where we're we're
it's

3132
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:00,999
we're in the middle of a
pandemic that

3133
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,999
had cost us more than 85

3134
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,999
000 jobs as of today lives of
millions

3135
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,999
of people that's the ones the
people

3136
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,999
millions of jobs that's the one
i mean

3137
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,999
everybody shakes their head and
says

3138
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,999
joe's gonna win the race

3139
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,999
you know and we're in a
position where

3140
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:22,999
you know we just got new
unemployment

3141
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:23,999
insurance 

3142
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,999
this morning uh numbers 365
million

3143
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,999
claims since this crisis began
and

3144
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:31,999
almost 

3145
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,999
3 million new claims in the
last week

3146
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,999
the unemployment rate is
nearing 15

3147
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:38,999
the highest it's been since the
great

3148
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,999
depression but i need not tell
you all

3149
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:41,999
that 

3150
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,999
of course it's uh it's the least

3151
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:44,999
well-off for

3152
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,999
being hit the hardest 40 of the

3153
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:47,999
households 

3154
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,999
making 40 000 or less

3155
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,999
experience the job loss just in
march

3156
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:55,999
and we're going to have to work
harder

3157
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:56,999
and smarter

3158
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,999
than ever before to pull
ourselves out

3159
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,999
of this economic tailspin and
this is

3160
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:01,999
the problem with

3161
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,999
with joe is that when he gets a
sentence

3162
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:04,999
out 

3163
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,999
it's really nothing there's
just nothing

3164
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:07,999
in it we're gonna have to work
hard

3165
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,999
pull together he doesn't really
have any

3166
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,999
i've no i think i've not heard
one

3167
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:13,999
single 

3168
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,999
uh policy oriented solution
even for

3169
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,999
uh african americans he came
out with

3170
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,999
the league the big joe biden's
black

3171
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:23,999
agenda 

3172
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,999
which was uh you know i think
it's

3173
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:27,999
called lift all

3174
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,999
we will lift all voices which
is not

3175
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:30,999
pandering at all

3176
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,999
to the religious black
americans um

3177
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:35,999
any and what he says in there
oh we're

3178
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,999
gonna we're gonna do a study

3179
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:38,999
and do a study to see if we
should do

3180
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,999
some reparations i mean this

3181
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,999
is the kind of crap that is not
gonna

3182
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:44,999
fly 

3183
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,999
but i know what sorry is this
mike

3184
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:48,999
is that still the clip oh yeah
there's

3185
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,999
another 40 seconds and seven
seconds to

3186
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:51,999
go 

3187
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,999
i'm sorry it seems like it
seems like

3188
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,999
weeks go by but all of you know

3189
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,999
i'm my second anniversary has
already

3190
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:01,999
taken place this clip is so
long the

3191
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,999
only way out of this

3192
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,999
is by following the science
listening to

3193
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:06,999
the experts

3194
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,999
talking and taking responsible

3195
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,999
precautions that

3196
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,999
are going to help us reopen the
economy

3197
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,999
i say fleeing as quickly as
possible

3198
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,999
and uh as we do there's got to
be

3199
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,999
federal support to state and
local

3200
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,999
levels of our government in my
view so

3201
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:23,999
that we'll be able to

3202
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,999
come out of this crisis
stronger and

3203
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:26,999
more united

3204
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,999
we have an opportunity in my
view to

3205
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,999
transform the economy as we
come out

3206
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:31,999
to build a more inclusive and
more

3207
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,999
resilient middle class

3208
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,999
and i think that can withstand
the next

3209
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,999
next public crisis whatever it
is

3210
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,999
however it comes about not just
reward

3211
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:42,999
the people who are well off and
well

3212
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:43,999
connected 

3213
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,999
it's time for us to make sure
everyone

3214
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,999
gets a fair shot of success in
this

3215
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:48,999
country 

3216
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:49,999
that's science i don't believe
in

3217
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,999
science 

3218
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,999
one last clip i want to get to
get this

3219
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,999
series completely out of the way

3220
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,999
they talked about this on pbs

3221
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,999
uh a little bit and judy this
is the

3222
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:02,999
judy 

3223
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,999
smear she this is smear that
she slipped

3224
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,999
into this little announcement
discussing

3225
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:08,999
the biden

3226
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,999
event in the days other news
former vice

3227
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,999
president joe biden says that if

3228
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,999
elected president he would not
pardon

3229
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,999
donald trump or his associates
of any

3230
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:18,999
crimes 

3231
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,999
instead he says he would let any

3232
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:21,999
investigations play out

3233
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,999
the presumptive democratic
nominee spoke

3234
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:25,999
in a virtual town hall

3235
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,999
on msnbc last night and he
accused mr

3236
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,999
trump of abusing his power

3237
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,999
we never saw anything like the

3238
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,999
prostitution of that office
like we see

3239
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:36,999
it today

3240
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,999
it is not something the
president is

3241
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,999
entitled to do

3242
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,999
to direct either a prosecution
and or

3243
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,999
decide to drop a case that is
not the

3244
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:47,999
president's role

3245
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,999
responsibility and it's a
dereliction of

3246
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,999
his duty

3247
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,999
what is he is he talking about
flynn is

3248
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,999
that what he's what he's saying

3249
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,999
yeah i think it's about flynn
well i

3250
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:58,999
have the clip that

3251
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,999
where he is i think he's in up
to his up

3252
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,999
to his eyeballs on this flynn
thing

3253
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,999
yeah by the way this was a smear

3254
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,999
when judy says that he's not
going to

3255
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:08,999
pardon trump that

3256
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,999
the way it was presented was as
though

3257
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,999
trump had had cr

3258
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,999
created an actual crime well
let's go to

3259
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:15,999
the 

3260
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,999
crime let's go to the town hall
and

3261
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:19,999
let's see how this

3262
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,999
came about the judy did not
play the

3263
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:22,999
source material because

3264
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,999
it was a request from an
audience member

3265
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:26,999
here it is

3266
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,999
would you be willing to commit
to not

3267
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,999
pulling a president forward

3268
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,999
and giving donald trump a
pardon under

3269
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:33,999
the 

3270
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,999
pretense of healing the nation

3271
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,999
in other words are you willing
to commit

3272
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:40,999
to the american ideal

3273
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,999
that no one is above the law
absolutely

3274
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:49,999
yes i commit

3275
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,999
i don't know it was a spiked
call or

3276
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,999
whatever but i commit

3277
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,999
these commitments please but
this

3278
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,999
but this town hall was very
interesting

3279
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,999
for another reason

3280
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,999
all of a sudden and this was
the joe

3281
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,999
biden special event

3282
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:08,999
the msnbc i think it was uh

3283
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,999
lawrence what's his name uh no

3284
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,999
laura lawrence o'donnell so
he's hosting

3285
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:15,999
it 

3286
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,999
and all of a sudden we've got
lawrence

3287
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:18,999
in the middle

3288
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,999
joe on the right and stacy
abram pops up

3289
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:22,999
on the

3290
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,999
left-hand box and hilarity
ensued

3291
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,999
as we watch stacey abrams
slowly lose

3292
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,999
her soul on live tv so i want
to begin

3293
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,999
this with a question to joe
biden

3294
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:34,999
because 

3295
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,999
uh stacey abrams is here
because joe

3296
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,999
biden invited stacey abrams to
be here

3297
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,999
and so uh mr vice president uh
do you

3298
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,999
have an announcement to make

3299
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,999
uh is this an audition is there

3300
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,999
uh what is the reason that that
you

3301
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,999
decided it's time for me to get

3302
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,999
what would you say stop the
hammering

3303
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,999
and on tv with stacy abrams
well because

3304
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,999
stacey abrams has done more to
deal with

3305
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,999
the fair vote and making sure
there is a

3306
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,999
fair vote than anybody

3307
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,999
and she's she has a great great
capacity

3308
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:10,999
to explain things

3309
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,999
mind you she's sitting here
right now

3310
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:14,999
saying nothing

3311
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,999
looking in the camera in her
own box on

3312
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:17,999
the left the smile

3313
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,999
started to slowly fade and the
layout

3314
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:21,999
exactly why it's going to be so

3315
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,999
critically important in this
election

3316
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,999
this president's already said
when they

3317
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,999
put in the stimulus package the
congress

3318
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:30,999
first passed

3319
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,999
money to provide for mail-in
ballots

3320
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,999
he already said i'm not for
that if we

3321
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:36,999
do that

3322
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,999
well no republican will ever
win or

3323
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:39,999
something to that effect

3324
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,999
he's made it clear this is the
guy who

3325
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,999
said he wants to

3326
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,999
defund the post office from
being able

3327
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:46,999
to deliver ballots i mean

3328
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,999
so stacy knows what she's doing
and uh

3329
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,999
and she's a incredibly capable
person

3330
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,999
and so since then that said
nothing he

3331
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:56,999
set her up if you want to make
an

3332
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:57,999
announcement 

3333
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,999
of course everyone's thinking
oh my

3334
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:00,999
goodness is going to be the vp

3335
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:01,999
announcement 

3336
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,999
nothing no that's embarrassing
did you

3337
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,999
think and by the way when did
trump say

3338
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,999
he wanted to defund the post
office

3339
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,999
because so they wouldn't deliver

3340
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,999
absentee i love that too i
thought it

3341
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:13,999
was 

3342
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,999
that was a nice touch why did
you say

3343
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,999
that no i don't i don't think i
don't i

3344
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:18,999
don't think he ever said that

3345
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,999
that was joe someone told you
hey just

3346
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:27,999
make make it up

3347
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,999
so i did see part of this i
didn't

3348
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,999
take any clips from it but it's
pathetic

3349
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,999
abrams is really a dud i just
don't

3350
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:37,999
understand what i was so

3351
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,999
jacked up about well and i will
say it

3352
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,999
again i'm going to remind
everybody my

3353
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:42,999
thinking on this

3354
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,999
having been a democrat there's

3355
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,999
not a woman in the democrat
party that

3356
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:49,999
will have

3357
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,999
stacey abrams as president until

3358
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,999
a white woman is president first

3359
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,999
if i may uh we this was a big

3360
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,999
topic on the mofax and uh

3361
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,999
and we discussed the vp slot

3362
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,999
specifically from an ados
perspective

3363
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,999
and stacy abrams is not wanted

3364
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,999
is not going to be it is being
shunned

3365
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:15,999
and 

3366
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,999
the reason why which i thought
was i

3367
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,999
hadn't really considered

3368
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,999
uh she is the oprah candidate
and

3369
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,999
when she ran for governor of
georgia oh

3370
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,999
remember oprah went down

3371
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,999
oh yeah promoting beyonce
everybody was

3372
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,999
there and she couldn't win

3373
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,999
and i think that uh and
remember oprah

3374
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,999
of course she she feels that
she made

3375
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,999
barack obama and she had a big
hand in

3376
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:41,999
it 

3377
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,999
for sure uh and this is her
candidate

3378
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:44,999
just think

3379
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,999
oprah can't run herself but
this would

3380
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:47,999
be 

3381
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,999
kind of like an oprah like an
oprah ugly

3382
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,999
you know and and

3383
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,999
and the democrat party wants
nothing to

3384
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:55,999
do with her

3385
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:56,999
and i think wants nothing to do
with

3386
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,999
oprah certainly after seeing
the combo

3387
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,999
oprah and stacey abrams in in
georgia

3388
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,999
failed and they're probably
questioning

3389
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,999
all kinds of celebrity
endorsements if

3390
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,999
they really are worth it anymore

3391
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,999
so no stacy according to mo and
i

3392
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,999
i think he laid out the uh

3393
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,999
i think he laid out the the the
case for

3394
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,999
that is not going to be

3395
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,999
vice president there's no doubt
about

3396
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:23,999
that not going to be the vice

3397
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:24,999
presidential nominee

3398
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,999
but she'll do anything she'll
even show

3399
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,999
up and and be publicly
embarrassed

3400
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,999
well i i'll just add to my
thinking on

3401
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:33,999
this is that

3402
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,999
no black woman will be the vice

3403
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:36,999
presidential candidate

3404
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,999
under biden which takes a
little further

3405
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:40,999
than just the

3406
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,999
targeting stacy because again
the

3407
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,999
white women that are democrats
are more

3408
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,999
racist than the republicans by
a lot

3409
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,999
having been in both parties and
they

3410
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:53,999
will not put especially when

3411
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,999
hillary was snubbed they will
not allow

3412
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:57,999
a black

3413
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,999
woman of any sorts they say
abrams or

3414
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,999
otherwise that's why

3415
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:02,999
camel and the rest of them are
all out

3416
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:03,999
too for other reasons i'm sure
you can

3417
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,999
target them

3418
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,999
but because they want a white
woman as

3419
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,999
the first female president
period and

3420
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:13,999
you think they're that racist
the

3421
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,999
democrat party

3422
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,999
yeah i do there are no

3423
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,999
they're already misogynist or
no i'm

3424
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,999
sorry miss anthropos by saying
it can

3425
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:23,999
only be a woman it can't be a
man

3426
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,999
because we don't qualify we're
no good

3427
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:26,999
we're stupid

3428
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,999
just look at joe there's going
to be a

3429
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:29,999
white 

3430
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,999
if it's not a white woman amy
klobuchar

3431
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:33,999
would be at the top of the list
i

3432
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,999
i would say that he wants to go
for some

3433
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,999
other ethnic possibilities
again i'll

3434
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,999
bring in uh luhan

3435
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,999
uh grisham out of new mexico and

3436
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,999
somebody sent us a note going
on and on

3437
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:44,999
about how

3438
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,999
that was me in particular since
i've

3439
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:47,999
been promoting her you saw that
note

3440
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,999
yeah i did i'm actually i'm
gonna grab

3441
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,999
the clip for you here's the clip

3442
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,999
that uh brought this uh comment
on hold

3443
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:55,999
on a second

3444
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,999
and um uh our secretary of state

3445
01:58:00,000 --> 01:57:59,999
insisted 

3446
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,999
and this broke the meeting up
basically

3447
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,999
in terms of her influence that

3448
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,999
this be called the lujan virus

3449
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,999
which was our producer said
well he just

3450
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,999
gave away the just gave away
who it's

3451
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:10,999
going to be

3452
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,999
who had the vice presidential
pick it

3453
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,999
had this luan was in the back
of his

3454
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,999
head he couldn't just not say it

3455
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:23,999
so it's a logical

3456
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,999
you know i'm still i'm hedging
my luhan

3457
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:26,999
bet 

3458
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,999
i'm putting her in the second
spot under

3459
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:29,999
amy yeah but

3460
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,999
oh i'm sorry amy klobuchar my
amy

3461
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,999
klobuchar is now top spot

3462
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:40,999
amy amy she would be kick ass

3463
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,999
as vice president i'm sure she
would

3464
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,999
well she's the

3465
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:46,999
except for the fact that she
throws

3466
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,999
staplers and yells at her staff
and

3467
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,999
she's mean

3468
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,999
which they suppressed to such
an extreme

3469
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,999
now we have her none of these
stories

3470
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:56,999
they were only apparent at the
beginning

3471
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,999
of the campaigning so which
makes me

3472
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,999
think that she may be

3473
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,999
a possibility for the vp slot

3474
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,999
since they're they're
sanitizing her as

3475
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:08,999
we speak

3476
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,999
so let's just to be clear amy
klobuchar

3477
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,999

3478
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:19,999

rich going into this season

01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,999
this is from fox sports

3488

fox sports fox fs1 fox sports
and that

3489
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:44,999
comes with a huge

3490
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,999
asterisk and hopefully there is
a season

3491
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:48,999
there's probably going to be a
season

3492
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:52,999
in doing games with no fans
which

3493
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,999
uh will be difficult i think
fox and

3494
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:55,999
these 

3495
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,999
networks have to put crowd
noise under

3496
01:59:59,000 --> 01:59:58,999
us 

3497
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:02,999
to to make it a huge designing

3498
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:03,999
experience at home

3499
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,999
you think they'll do that i do
yeah i

3500
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:07,999
really 

3501
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:12,999
i know in fact i know they'll
do it um

3502
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,999
let him finish let him finish
you're

3503
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,999
yelling through my sports clip
it's not

3504
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:16,999
that 

3505
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,999
often that i bring one in fact
i know

3506
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:19,999
they'll do it um

3507
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,999
and they are that's that's the

3508
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,999
conversation right now

3509
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,999
that's that's it's pretty much
a done

3510
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,999
deal i think whoever's going to
be

3511
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,999
at that control is going to
have to be

3512
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:30,999
really good at their job and

3513
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,999
and be realistic with how a
crowd would

3514
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,999
react depending on what just
happened on

3515
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:35,999
the field so

3516
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,999
it's really important then on
top of

3517
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,999
that they're going to put uh
they're

3518
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,999
looking at ways to put virtual
fans in

3519
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,999
the stands so when you see a
wide chat

3520
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,999
it looks like the stadium is
jam-packed

3521
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,999
hey sports fans you're not
needed you're

3522
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:49,999
completely replaceable

3523
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,999
in fact they should just play
the games

3524
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,999
in a big blue screen

3525
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,999
green screen auditorium and do
all kinds

3526
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:56,999
of cool stuff

3527
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,999
you know this is telling uh you
know

3528
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,999
what this tells this confirms

3529
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,999
the basic no agenda thesis is
that all

3530
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,999
sports are rigged

3531
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,999
no kidding this is taking the
rigging to

3532
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:09,999
it to a maximum

3533
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:13,999
you have fake fake audience
fake noise

3534
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:14,999
fake applause the whole thing
you know

3535
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,999
it's the canned laughter again
once

3536
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,999
put canned laughter to get a can

3537
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,999
laughter guy in there and have
him just

3538
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,999
yuck it up uh it's unbelievable
oh my

3539
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:24,999
god i can't believe it's an
interception

3540
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:29,999
oh no he drops he fumbles

3541
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,999
that's the best we can do
that's about

3542
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,999
all i got

3543
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,999
oh my god there's a cruise
missile

3544
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:37,999
there's a cruise missile going
over the

3545
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,999
stadium what can we do about it
the

3546
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,999
cruise missile

3547
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,999
i have nothing else yeah

3548
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,999
that'd be very sad but it'll
fit with

3549
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,999
the fight fake outcome of

3550
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,999
of these games so that's good
uh oh yes

3551
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:52,999
i do have one more

3552
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,999
uh biden related clip short one

3553
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,999
the convention which is coming
up in

3554
02:01:59,000 --> 02:01:59,999
what is there

3555
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:00,999
is the democrats supposed to be
in

3556
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,999
august have they moved it is
that

3557
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:04,999
i don't know maybe it was in
july they

3558
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:05,999
moved to august i don't know
august is

3559
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:06,999
the last i heard

3560
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,999
here is the uh the
communications

3561
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,999
director of the dnc

3562
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,999
regarding the convention and uh
i think

3563
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:14,999
this 

3564
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:16,999
maybe i'm reading too much into
it but

3565
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:17,999
it felt a little bit like

3566
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,999
not everyone in the party is on
board

3567
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,999
with joe have a listen

3568
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:22,999
i mean there's a real
possibility that

3569
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:24,999
the convention does not happen
or it

3570
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,999
happens in a virtual sense

3571
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:28,999
is that correct well first of
all our

3572
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,999
convention has to happen
because we

3573
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,999
are not officially nominating
joe biden

3574
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:36,999
in order to take donald trump
so our

3575
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:37,999
convention is happening there is

3576
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,999
business that has to happen

3577
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,999
now when it comes to um what our

3578
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,999
convention is going to look like

3579
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,999
i can guarantee you that our
convention

3580
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:47,999
will ensure

3581
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,999
that the safe that is safety
first

3582
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:50,999
whether it is our delegates

3583
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,999
the people of milwaukee or all
of those

3584
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:54,999
involved in a convention

3585
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,999
we will make sure that they are
safe

3586
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,999
whatever that looks like and
that they

3587
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,999
vote for our nominee now did
you catch

3588
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,999
the beginning of how she
phrased that

3589
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,999
i'll play it again i mean
there's a real

3590
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,999
possibility of the convention
does not

3591
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:10,999
happen or it happens in a
virtual sense

3592
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,999
is that correct our convention
has to

3593
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:15,999
happen because

3594
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,999
we um are not officially
nominating joe

3595
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:18,999
biden 

3596
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,999
in order to take donald trump i
like how

3597
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:22,999
he 

3598
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,999
did notice that take donald
trump i

3599
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,999
thought that was an interesting

3600
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,999
use of words is that how they
see it to

3601
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,999
take donald trump

3602
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,999
well that's their only goal but
did you

3603
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,999
listen to it carefully she says
our

3604
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,999
convention is not to nominate
joe biden

3605
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,999
is that correct as of today
well first

3606
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,999
of all our convention has to
happen

3607
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:43,999
because 

3608
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,999
we um are not officially
nominating joe

3609
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:47,999
biden 

3610
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,999
in order to take donald trump
so our

3611
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:50,999
convention is happening there is

3612
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:51,999
business 

3613
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,999
we're not nominating joe biden
as what

3614
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:55,999
she said i told you there's
something

3615
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,999
weird in that clip and she

3616
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,999
seems like she's not i know for
a comms

3617
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:00,999
director i think she let out a
little

3618
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:01,999
bit too much there

3619
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,999
my personal personal opinion oh
yeah

3620
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,999
they don't care about anything
but

3621
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:06,999
donald trump

3622
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,999
that's this you can't win
elections that

3623
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,999
way 

3624
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,999
all right uh i i am very
excited to have

3625
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,999

which uh is a send-in from one
of our

3627
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,999

02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,999
thank some more people who are
on the

3629
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,999

classic

very very pleased with that

3692
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,999
john continues i've always
disliked the

3693
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,999
media but in the last few years
the mask

3694
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:42,999
has really come off

3695
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:44,999
it is awesome finding
like-minded people

3696
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,999
i look forward to joining the
meetup

3697
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:47,999
once the not lockdown is lifted
thanks

3698
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:48,999
for all you do

3699
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,999
to keep people away from the
m5m fear

3700
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,999
porn yes and keep amygdala
small i have

3701
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,999
managed to figure out

3702
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,999
most of the insider terminology
this is

3703
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:58,999
always a problem with the
newbies

3704
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,999
but i have a few questions okay
what is

3705
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:05,999
the significance of the number
33

3706
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:09,999
are you big fans of rolling
rock beer

3707
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:13,999
well let him stew in this one

3708
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,999
really well let me just say one
thing

3709
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,999
we've noticed over time

3710
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,999
that when the number 33 shows
up in news

3711
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,999
reports 

3712
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,999
there's typically something
very fishy

3713
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,999
going on with the report or
with the

3714
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:27,999
situation now

3715
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,999
of course we have uh it's we've
taken it

3716
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:31,999
so far that and this has been
going on

3717
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,999
since almost the first day we
did the

3718
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:34,999
show 

3719
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:35,999
uh that people are noticing it

3720
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,999
everywhere and during the uh
this rona

3721
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,999
crisis it was everywhere 33
this 30

3722
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,999
through that 33 people are sick
33 is

3723
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:42,999
there 

3724
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,999
and we have a jingle for it

3725
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:47,999
so that's it it's the magic
number

3726
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,999
whenever we see 33 we pay
attention

3727
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,999
we're never sure what it's
going to mean

3728
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,999
but something always comes out
of it

3729
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,999
yeah it's code it's code

3730
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:57,999
it's and here's another one he
brings up

3731
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:58,999
which i think should be this

3732
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,999
i'm reading this because this
is good

3733
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,999
stuff to reiterate for the
newcomers

3734
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,999
it seems harsh to call people
douchebags

3735
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,999
that have not donated but i
will not

3736
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,999
become a douchebag if i've
included my

3737
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,999
donation 100 but okay let's
start

3738
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,999
let's start with that concept
this was

3739
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:16,999
not 

3740
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,999
our idea no ever no

3741
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:23,999
no we we also don't do it if
you realize

3742
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:24,999
we are reading

3743
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,999
the notes that people send in
we're not

3744
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,999
calling them douchebags

3745
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,999
uh anyway he goes on he says uh
he goes

3746
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:34,999
on just

3747
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:35,999

02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,999
i guess there was yeah some
people are

3943
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:00,999
diehards 

3944
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:02,999
and i appreciate that this is
vernon

3945
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,999
this is the may 16th marcellus
new york

3946
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:06,999
nine mile creek

3947
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,999
meetup report the adam there
were plenty

3948
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:10,999
of people sitting around
maskless at the

3949
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,999
picnic tables and benches near
the

3950
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,999
baseball diamond at marcellus
park but

3951
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,999
no one asked me about no agenda
people

3952
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:18,999
did ask me about my white

3953
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:20,999
uh cockapoo's red boots which
was the

3954
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,999
indicator i was the meetup
leader

3955
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,999
i guess not many people look at
the

3956
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:26,999
website if no podcast meetup

3957
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,999
announcement is made and there
you go

3958
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,999
so i guess that was a
one-person meet-up

3959
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:35,999
darn sorry vernon better luck
next time

3960
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:47,999

[Music] 

3962
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:00,999
like a party

3963
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:04,999
so are you ready for um

3964
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:05,999
sometimes i want to take before
you go

3965
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,999
into no before you do that i
got a

3966
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:07,999
little 

3967
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:11,999
uh on tremont okay

3968
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,999
uh curiously this is 43 seconds
and it

3969
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,999
look a little like the joe
biden stuff

3970
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:16,999
which is really less than two
minutes

3971
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,999
but it went on forever for some
unknown

3972
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:19,999
reason 

3973
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,999
this isn't going to be another
one the

3974
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:22,999
this is a apparently

3975
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:26,999
all the virtue signaling uh
celebrities

3976
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,999
mostly yeah are out there
showing uh

3977
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,999
doing commencement speeches

3978
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,999

02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:35,999
they're all doing i didn't know
that he

3980
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:36,999
was doing one but

3981
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,999
he he'd go and do it oh no i'm
sorry uh

3982
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,999
president obama i mean not the

3983
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:42,999
president president obama has
been doing

3984
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:43,999
commencement speech oh yes that
would be

3985
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:44,999
true 

3986
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,999
uh but they're all doing them
virtually

3987
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:47,999
and they're in a bucket they're
usually

3988
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:48,999
in a bucket or they find a good
place to

3989
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:49,999
put the mic

3990
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,999
it's a little bucket on the
side and

3991
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,999
they're all in a bucket and
they're all

3992
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:55,999
giving these commencement
speeches that

3993
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,999
are lame and they're terrible
but i've

3994
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:00,999
decided i'm going to look for
the worst

3995
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:04,999
oh yay so this is a short

3996
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,999
snippet from tom hanks

3997
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,999
uh giving a commencement speech
just to

3998
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:10,999
some small

3999
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,999
western case or something i get
the the

4000
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:15,999
name of the school here
somewhere it's

4001
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:16,999
uh 

4002
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:17,999
wright state you want your
rights and

4003
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,999
never heard of him right stay
sorry

4004
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,999
anybody writes state alums uh
so he's

4005
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:23,999
giving this speech

4006
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,999
he's reading it kind of but he
kind of

4007
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:28,999
lost track and i think he
started off

4008
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:29,999
with saying the wrong thing and
he's

4009
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,999
tried to make up for it and and
he just

4010
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:34,999
kid he never really caught up
to it so

4011
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:36,999
the speech became this

4012
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,999
discombubilated piece of crap
here it is

4013
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,999
congratulations to you chosen
ones wow

4014
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:46,999
stop right there this is i

4015
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:48,999
i don't understand how they
allow this

4016
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:49,999
to happen i i

4017
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:53,999
this sound is just beyond me
beyond me

4018
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,999
congratulations to you chosen
ones

4019
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,999
and i am calling you the chosen
ones

4020
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:00,999
because you

4021
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,999
have been chosen in many ways

4022
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:05,999
you have not returned to the
starting

4023
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:06,999
line like all of

4024
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:08,999
us generations before you
you're just

4025
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,999
approaching it now for the
first time

4026
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,999
you've just arrived you are
chosen in

4027
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:15,999
that way

4028
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,999
to enter into the competition
of life

4029
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:19,999
just when so

4030
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,999
many have had to recover and
refresh and

4031
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:23,999
restart 

4032
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,999
and reawaken and to retake up
the hard

4033
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,999
work and the unshirkable

4034
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,999
responsibilities 

4035
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:34,999
of making the world not only
our own

4036
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,999
but of your own wow

4037
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,999
talk about he start here's what
happened

4038
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:41,999
he says congrats

4039
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:42,999
i think he kind of ad libbed the

4040
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:43,999
beginning thinking it was going
to be

4041
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,999
cool and he

4042
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:48,999
to said chosen ones and then he
thought

4043
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,999
to himself right on the spot

4044
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:55,999
wait a minute i'm not joking

4045
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,999
i mean this is offensive what
i'm saying

4046
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:58,999
here 

4047
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:00,999
and so he then goes and tries
to make up

4048
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:02,999
for it and it says by what by

4049
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,999
what i mean by chosen ones and
then

4050
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,999
the whole thing falls apart and
it's

4051
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,999
just an embarrassment

4052
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:11,999
and he's in his home with a
brick wall

4053
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,999
behind him and he's trying to
read off

4054
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:14,999
his notes

4055
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:16,999
this is just should not be
people should

4056
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,999
not be doing this that was
pretty much

4057
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,999
the definition of phoning it in

4058
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,999
it was really bad from the
sound to the

4059
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:24,999
copy 

4060
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,999
to everything and even the
intent even

4061
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:29,999
the intent why does he why

4062
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,999
why are they doing that very
odd and if

4063
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:33,999
you're gonna do it do it do a
great

4064
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:35,999
make it memorable not like oh
i'm tom

4065
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,999
hanks in a bucket

4066
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:39,999
yeah the other thing is these
guys all

4067
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:41,999
know production values and
people like

4068
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:42,999
tom 

4069
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:44,999
hanks is a good example he's
not like

4070
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,999
he's a producer

4071
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:48,999
yes he's a producer he could
produce a

4072
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:49,999
video 

4073
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:51,999
and he could put the good sound
with it

4074
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:52,999
he's got nothing else to do he's

4075
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,999
he's holed up in his mansion he
could

4076
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:56,999
put us he could put a track
behind

4077
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:58,999
himself he could have a

4078
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:00,999
green screen he could be in
paris i mean

4079
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:02,999
there's a million things you
could do to

4080
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,999
make it lively but no

4081
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,999
he's just walks through a bucket

4082
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:08,999
presentation 

4083
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:10,999
it's embarrassing these guys
are just

4084
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:12,999
showing that they really

4085
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:13,999
are they really producers or
are they

4086
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,999
just front men that is

4087
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:17,999
with no talent what uh what was
the

4088
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:19,999
school he was doing this for as
it's

4089
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:20,999

4133
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:08,999
northern nevada

4134
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,999
just wanted to give you my
update on the

4135
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:12,999
nevada earthquake that we had

4136
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:16,999
early this morning on friday
may 15th

4137
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,999
i was driving through pretty
much the

4138
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:19,999
epicenter 

4139
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:23,999
exactly when it happened felt
the

4140
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:24,999
truck shake a bit and i was
wondering

4141
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,999
what's going on it's pretty
windy

4142
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,999
but as i was going up the road
highway

4143
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,999
95 there was one crack and i'm
like oh

4144
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:33,999
that's strange that wasn't here
when i

4145
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:37,999
drove down to tonopah from reno
and then

4146
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:38,999
there was another crack

4147
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:39,999
and then a third crack and i'm
like oh

4148
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:41,999
there must have been an
earthquake and

4149
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:43,999
lo and behold there was

4150
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:47,999
but interesting thing that i
noticed

4151
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,999
as this was happening i was
looking up

4152
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:51,999
on the

4153
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:53,999
the ridgeline of the mountains
to the

4154
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,999
west and i saw this bright blue
light

4155
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:57,999
behind the mountains and i'm
like i

4156
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,999
wonder what that is because it
didn't

4157
02:24:00,000 --> 02:23:59,999
look like an

4158
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,999
airplane or any kind of truck
light it

4159
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:03,999
looked like something else so

4160
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:05,999
if you guys know the area
middle nevada

4161
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:06,999
western nevada it

4162
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,999
is a lot of federal land
there's a huge

4163
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:10,999
army depot

4164
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,999
just north in hawthorne and

4165
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,999
you know area 51 is not too far
away so

4166
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:18,999
who knows maybe get the
theremin out

4167
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:20,999
some tinfoil

4168
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,999
and hopefully some other
producers have

4169
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,999
some information that maybe can
shed

4170
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:27,999
some light on the subject

4171
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,999
but that's my take from
northern nevada

4172
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:31,999
it's the battle born black baron

4173
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,999
joel in the morning thank you
thank you

4174
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:35,999
for your courage

4175
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:36,999
in the morning thank you for
your

4176
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,999
courage well northern nevada
and area 51

4177
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:39,999
there's 

4178
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,999
not even close no i but i don't
think he

4179
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:43,999
was insinuating was aliens

4180
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:45,999
um i've been paying attention
to this

4181
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,999
weird weather we have had

4182
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,999
torrential downpour

4183
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:52,999
literally just texas it's been
very

4184
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:53,999
interesting 

4185
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,999
to see the weather patterns and
maybe uh

4186
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:57,999
there's some

4187
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:59,999
harp fire age going on who
knows i don't

4188
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:00,999
know what's happening but the
blue light

4189
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:01,999
out there

4190
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,999
that's odd and these
earthquakes has

4191
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:04,999
that happened before

4192
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:06,999
like 30 40 earthquakes on a day
in

4193
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,999
nevada maybe it has i don't know

4194
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:10,999
there's an area in nevada where
they

4195
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:12,999
have a lot of quakes it was a

4196
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:16,999
but that was due to fracking
right

4197
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,999
um well i don't know we'll keep
an eye

4198
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:19,999
on it

4199
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:23,999
i'm sure that we'll find out
nothing

4200
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,999
oh you're so positive we'll
keep looking

4201
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:28,999
we'll look and look we'll keep
looking

4202
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:29,999
we're not going to get anywhere
with

4203
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:30,999
this 

4204
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,999
all right any more screwball
reports

4205
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:35,999
no i don't have that but i do
have an

4206
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:36,999
update 

4207
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,999
on thousands of sealed
indictments yes

4208
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:40,999
yes 

4209
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:42,999
yes i'm telling you everyone's
out on

4210
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:44,999
the woodworks we've got
everyone talking

4211
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,999
clappers on tv brennan's on tv

4212
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:49,999
everyone's getting their points
in and i

4213
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,999
think a good backgrounder is to
go

4214
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,999
to the man who is the
mainstream gateway

4215
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:54,999
for 

4216
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,999
thousands of sealed indictments
lou

4217
02:25:58,000 --> 02:25:58,999
dobbs on

4218
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,999
fox uh business news and uh
here is uh

4219
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:02,999
who i think is a good uh

4220
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,999
journalist john solomon to
bring us the

4221
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:06,999
lowdown 

4222
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,999
yeah everyone i've talked to
today has

4223
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:10,999
been exasperated by the judge's
conduct

4224
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:11,999
but at the end of the day it's
a lot of

4225
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:12,999
show 

4226
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,999
for an inevitable conclusion at
the end

4227
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:15,999
of the day

4228
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:17,999
these charges are going to be
dismissed

4229
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:19,999
against uh general flynn
because the law

4230
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:20,999
requires it

4231
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:22,999
when both parties go in as they
do in

4232
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:23,999
this case and when there is a

4233
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:25,999
preponderance of evidence as
there is in

4234
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,999
this case of wrongdoing the
courts have

4235
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:29,999
consistently allowed

4236
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:33,999
a vacation or vacating of a

4237
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:35,999
conviction like this it's just
going to

4238
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:36,999
extend the drama a little
longer but

4239
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:38,999
it's going to inevitably end up
whether

4240
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:39,999
it's at the supreme court the
appellate

4241
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:40,999
court 

4242
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:42,999
or the district court it's
going to end

4243
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:43,999
up getting the the charges are
going to

4244
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:44,999
be dismissed

4245
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:46,999
finally and i do say finally uh
lindsey

4246
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:47,999
graham has

4247
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,999
scheduled a hearing to dig into
these

4248
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:51,999
very serious issues i

4249
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:53,999
i know his investigative staff
very well

4250
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:55,999
they're very competent

4251
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:56,999
they've been working very hard
behind

4252
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:58,999
the scenes they're going to
have some

4253
02:26:59,000 --> 02:26:59,999
big 

4254
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,999
big revelations that are not
yet public

4255
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:03,999
uh that will move this
narrative along

4256
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:05,999
and show just how far reaching
the

4257
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:06,999
corruption inside

4258
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:08,999
the bureaucracy was uh as for
the issue

4259
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:09,999
of president obama

4260
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,999
you know there's gonna come a
moment

4261
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:13,999
after that first evidence is
laid out in

4262
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:14,999
his hearings

4263
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:15,999
where people are going to
obviously say

4264
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:17,999
hey this started at the top with

4265
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:18,999
president obama

4266
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:20,999
and then i think lindsey graham
will

4267
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:21,999
have to face the music of his
own

4268
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:22,999
evidence 

4269
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:23,999
and decide what he's going to
do and i

4270
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:25,999
think that moment may you know
when the

4271
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:26,999
evidence is all out there

4272
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:28,999
there'll be an even more
poignant

4273
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:30,999
question to the to the chairman

4274
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:32,999
why aren't you talking to
president uh

4275
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:33,999
obama and i think well you know
let's

4276
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:35,999
see what the evidence comes out
but

4277
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:37,999
keep in mind over the last few
months

4278
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:38,999
there's been a lot of
information taken

4279
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:40,999
from the national archives

4280
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:42,999
from the obama administration
they lay

4281
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:44,999
out a very powerful case

4282
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:45,999
we're going to begin to see that

4283
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:47,999
evidence over the next three
four weeks

4284
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:49,999
and all i can say from what i
know from

4285
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,999
my reporting is buckle your
seatbelt

4286
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:56,999
buckle your seatbelt well well

4287
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:58,999
first of all i am not buckling
my seat

4288
02:27:59,000 --> 02:27:59,999
belts 

4289
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,999
for starters uh-huh yeah no
kidding

4290
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:03,999
because 

4291
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:07,999
nothing's coming up any of this

4292
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:09,999
well i'm not so sure i think
that

4293
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:10,999
something's going to happen we
you know

4294
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:12,999
this flynn stuff

4295
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,999
and the unmasking and fisa
court abuses

4296
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:16,999
i i think

4297
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,999
something will come of that but
we'll

4298
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:20,999
well let me finish

4299
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:22,999
it's easy to say i have i have
some some

4300
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,999
i've received

4301
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:30,999
have some backup um

4302
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:31,999
there's a lot of running around
of

4303
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,999
people coming out who haven't
spoken for

4304
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:35,999
a long time and i think they're
all

4305
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,999
jockeying and positioning
clapper seems

4306
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:40,999
to be the the top guy

4307
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,999
uh now this was cnn it was

4308
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:45,999
uh people called this
differently than

4309
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:46,999
it was

4310
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,999
uh the way it was posted is oh
look he

4311
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,999
asked him a tough question and
then the

4312
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,999
connection breaks

4313
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:55,999
but it actually you can hear a
little

4314
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,999
truly an audio glitch

4315
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:58,999
uh it froze right after the
first

4316
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:00,999
question so he didn't he
probably didn't

4317
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:01,999
even hear the second one but
that

4318
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:03,999
doesn't mean that he wasn't
removed from

4319
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:03,999
this 

4320
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,999
uh zoom call

4321
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:08,999
uh so we could not answer
here's uh

4322
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:10,999
clapper former director of
national

4323
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:11,999
intelligence 

4324
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:15,999
uh and a liar uh a liar to
congress

4325
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,999
uh but unindicted okay so
asking for

4326
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:19,999
names 

4327
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,999
nothing wrong with that
unmasking in and

4328
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:22,999
of itself nothing wrong with
that

4329
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,999
leaking classified information
and by

4330
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:26,999
definition these phone calls

4331
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:30,999
were classified that's a
problem correct

4332
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,999
uh absolutely it is um and if
anyone you

4333
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:34,999
hear the little

4334
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:35,999
that's when he cut out but
we'll do the

4335
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:37,999
question anyway did leak

4336
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,999
the contents of these
conversations with

4337
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:41,999
or without the name

4338
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,999
that would be a problem yes uh
we've

4339
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:45,999
lost the shot i wonder if we
can at

4340
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,999
least get him on the phone

4341
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:48,999
to finish this let's try to get
director

4342
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:50,999
clapper back all right we're
going to

4343
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:51,999
work 

4344
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,999
we're going to work on getting
that shot

4345
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:55,999
yeah so of course they did get
him back

4346
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:56,999
later this question didn't come
up

4347
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:00,999
but was he willing to testify
ah yeah

4348
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:01,999
can you come in and testify

4349
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,999
uh given my age demographic i'd
be happy

4350
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:05,999
to come

4351
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:07,999
uh after i've been vaccinated
for covert

4352
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,999
19. 

4353
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,999
would you testify i could do it
remotely

4354
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:12,999
as 

4355
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:16,999
the case with uh the faucet
hearing or

4356
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,999
respond to questions or or or
that sort

4357
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:20,999
of thing but

4358
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:22,999
uh i don't particularly want to
put my

4359
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:23,999
life or that on my

4360
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,999
wife uh in life in jeopardy uh

4361
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,999
for uh in pr in person testimony

4362
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:31,999
yeah so basically not intending
to

4363
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:33,999
testify to anything at all

4364
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,999
because corona covid

4365
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,999
the other guy out and about was
former

4366
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:40,999
cia director

4367
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:44,999
john brennan and uh have you
heard do

4368
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:46,999
you know yet if his uh

4369
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,999
clearance has been uh removed
no i just

4370
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:50,999
got no information one way or
the other

4371
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,999
we just don't know i'd like to
remind

4372
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,999
you john brennan's uh stance

4373
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,999
on uh the law and

4374
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:02,999
when you are guilty or when you

4375
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:04,999
should be sentenced or charged
it's very

4376
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:06,999
short he's very clear

4377
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:08,999
people are innocent until
alleged to be

4378
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:09,999
involved in some type of
criminal

4379
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:10,999
activity 

4380
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:12,999
so this would be guilty john
brennan who

4381
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:14,999
was alleged to have some part in

4382
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:15,999
criminal activity

4383
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,999
and this is a longer clip uh
but it i

4384
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:19,999
think it's

4385
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:21,999
extra good because you can hear
well

4386
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:22,999
we'll we'll discuss it

4387
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,999
chris hayes and john brennan
there does

4388
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:27,999
seem to be a bit of a shift

4389
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:29,999
in the last several months with
william

4390
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:31,999
barr at the department of
justice with

4391
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:32,999
richard grinnell

4392
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,999
at dni such that the actual
machinery

4393
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,999
and tools of government are
being kind

4394
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:38,999
of applied

4395
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:39,999
along the lines of the rhetoric
of the

4396
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:41,999
president how do you see things
right

4397
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:41,999
now 

4398
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,999
well chris that's exactly why i
think

4399
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:46,999
the recent developments are so
worrisome

4400
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,999
because mr trump has removed
individuals

4401
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:51,999
from the head of the intel's
community

4402
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,999
as well as from the fbi as and
justice

4403
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:56,999
and he's trying to put people
in who are

4404
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:58,999
going to do his bidding

4405
02:31:59,000 --> 02:31:59,999
so we saw recently with the
acting

4406
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:01,999
director of national
intelligence rich

4407
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:03,999
purnell a hand-picked
individual who

4408
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:04,999
i think has demonstrated his
loyalty to

4409
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:06,999
mr trump over the years

4410
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,999
um releasing uh declassifying
the names

4411
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:10,999
of individuals who had

4412
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,999
unmasked some names in
intelligence

4413
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:14,999
reports 

4414
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,999
and with the implication that
that was

4415
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:18,999
wrongdoing 

4416
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:19,999
well it wasn't carrying out our

4417
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:21,999
responsibilities 

4418
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:23,999
incorrectly but then when i
look at the

4419
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:25,999
attorney general mr barr

4420
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,999
now so of course there's no
diving into

4421
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:29,999
the fact that it was

4422
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,999
39 people who were a

4423
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:34,999
witness to or who had requested
and

4424
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:35,999
received unmasking

4425
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:37,999
but i guess that's just the job
carrying

4426
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:39,999
out our responsibilities

4427
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:41,999
correctly but then when i look
at the

4428
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:43,999
attorney general mr barr

4429
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:47,999
and how he has repeatedly
demonstrated

4430
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:48,999
that his interest is being the

4431
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:50,999
president's lawyer

4432
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,999
as opposed to being the
people's lawyer

4433
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:55,999
you need to get the updated
memo brennan

4434
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:56,999
that's pretty old hat you're
repeating

4435
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:57,999
there 

4436
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:59,999
uh and i'm very worried that the

4437
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:00,999
instruments of governance

4438
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:02,999
the instruments of intelligence
and law

4439
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,999
enforcement and justice are now
being

4440
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,999
exploited and manipulated in mr
trump's

4441
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:09,999
hands and i think that's
something that

4442
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:11,999
should worry all americans

4443
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:12,999
it's one thing to have policy

4444
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:14,999
differences and we can have

4445
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,999
arguments in public about that
but if

4446
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:19,999
he's going to try to bring

4447
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:20,999
charges against individuals
trumped up

4448
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:22,999
charges because of his political

4449
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:23,999
interests 

4450
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:25,999
and he's going to have
individuals who

4451
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:26,999
are going to help

4452
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,999
make that happen that is
something that

4453
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:30,999
i saw

4454
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:32,999
overseas in my career my
national

4455
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:34,999
security career

4456
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:35,999
and i never thought i would see
that

4457
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:37,999
happening here in the united
states

4458
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:39,999
clearly back in the last
century in the

4459
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:40,999
1970s 

4460
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:44,999
we had incidents where
president nixon

4461
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:46,999
tried to use the fbi and cia
and others

4462
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:48,999
for political purposes

4463
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,999
and we had quite an uproar at
that time

4464
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:51,999
and 

4465
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,999
president nixon was forced out
of office

4466
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:56,999
sad to say that it sounds like
we are

4467
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,999
now back in the same type of
environment

4468
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,999
where an individual in the
white house

4469
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:03,999
is now using

4470
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,999
those organizations and using
people

4471
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:08,999
in senior positions in
intelligence and

4472
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:09,999
law enforcement for his

4473
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:14,999
own purposes

4474
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:16,999
that is the best example of
projection

4475
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:18,999
i've heard from him

4476
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:22,999
and says just like richard
nixon clearly

4477
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:24,999
this president was using the

4478
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:26,999
intelligence apparatus

4479
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,999
to get at his enemies it's
exactly

4480
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,999
what happened allegedly with
the whole

4481
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:36,999
obama administration

4482
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,999
if if that isn't rewriting the
history

4483
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:40,999
the history of

4484
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,999
nixon is also saying

4485
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,999
out of the picture of these
guys oh this

4486
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:46,999
guy is the worst

4487
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:48,999
i think there's a fall guy the
cia

4488
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:50,999
should be embarrassed that he
was ever

4489
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,999
part of their operation yeah
there's one

4490
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:54,999
little quick

4491
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:56,999
thing a quick bite i got here
which may

4492
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:58,999
be the fall guy because
someone's got to

4493
02:34:59,000 --> 02:34:58,999
go 

4494
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:00,999
i'm just hoping that
individuals like

4495
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:01,999
chris ray who

4496
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,999
is a remarkable public servant
will

4497
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:05,999
continue to stay strong

4498
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:07,999
in the face of this type of um

4499
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:08,999
abominable 

4500
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:13,999
uh vulnerable uh

4501
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:17,999
so chris ray's on the block

4502
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,999
let's listen did he say obama

4503
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,999
wow individuals like

4504
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,999
chris ray who is a remarkable
public

4505
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:26,999
servant 

4506
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:28,999
will continue to stay strong in
the face

4507
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:30,999
of this type of

4508
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,999
um abominable uh vulnerable

4509
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:37,999
again abuse of authority oh man

4510
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:43,999
obamable that's a great word

4511
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:45,999
oh bombable but i think
christopher wray

4512
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,999
is on the block

4513
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:48,999
i think that may have been what
you just

4514
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:50,999
heard there that clip

4515
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:54,999
uh i think put put him on the
block

4516
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:56,999
well that that would have been
part of

4517
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,999

coastal states like georgia and
florida

4541
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:54,999
but as one of the state's
hardest hit by

4542
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:55,999
the covet 19 pandemic

4543
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:57,999
local officials say they are
proceeding

4544
02:36:58,000 --> 02:36:59,999
cautiously 

4545
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:01,999
at exactly 10 am yesterday
barriers that

4546
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:02,999
had been blocking the boardwalk
and

4547
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:04,999
beach in seaside heights new
jersey

4548
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:06,999
were pushed aside an
announcement made

02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:11,999
these beaches are now
officially open

once again these beaches are now

4552
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,999
officially open it's a sign
that things

4553
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:16,999
are returning to normal in this

4554
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:18,999
quintessential jersey shore town

4555
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:20,999
sort of we're looking to see
how we do

4556
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:22,999
with the social distance

4557
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:24,999
and that's going to be our test
today

4558
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:26,999
tony vaz is the mayor of
seaside heights

4559
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:28,999
after nearly two months of
being closed

4560
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:29,999
because of covet 19

4561
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:31,999
visitors can now walk and ride
bikes on

4562
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:32,999
the boardwalk

4563
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,999
provided they heed the rule of
six feet

4564
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:37,999
between groups of people

4565
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:39,999
on the beach there's no
swimming or

4566
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:41,999
sunbathing but the public can
walk

4567
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,999
fish and even surf mayor vaz
says it's

4568
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:46,999
just the first phase of seaside
heights

4569
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:47,999
is reopening

4570
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:49,999
i'm optimistic that this is a
good first

4571
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:50,999
step 

4572
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,999
obviously i would love to see
everything

4573
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:54,999
open i would love to see us
swimming

4574
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,999
and so forth but we have to
recognize

4575
02:37:58,000 --> 02:37:59,999
that we have to take this in
steps

4576
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:01,999
seaside heights is one of more
than

4577
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:03,999
three dozen communities along
the jersey

4578
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:03,999
shore 

4579
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,999
grappling with how best to
reopen in

4580
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:08,999
neighboring seaside park

4581
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:10,999
beaches are already open to
sunbathers

4582
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,999
provided beachgoers keep their
distance

4583
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,999
you know i was more interested
in this

4584
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:17,999
this tony vaz

4585
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:22,999
guy he sounds identical to joe
pesci

4586
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:24,999
yeah it does a little bit
that's a

4587
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:26,999
little bit a little bit i
actually have

4588
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:28,999
a clip from further on in that

4589
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,999
in that that presentation

4590
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,999
and this is the 16 seconds of
him talk

4591
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:35,999

4592
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,999
voiceover gig anytime he wants
one then

4593
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:38,999
he 

4594
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:40,999
by the way he's wearing a mask
so he's

4595
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:42,999
kind of muffled but this is
tony vaz

4596
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:44,999
talking a little bit more if we
just

4597
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:45,999
obey the rules

4598
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:46,999
you know you're going to stop
at a

4599
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:48,999
stoplight yeah we gotta we
gotta whack

02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:49,999
him 

4601
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:51,999
that's a rule so you know if
it's social

4602
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:53,999
dissidency now social
distancing if you

4603

02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,999
experienced its first heat wave
of

4648
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:28,999
the year beachgoers were
required to

4649
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:29,999
keep their distance as officials

4650
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:31,999
stipulated how many people
could be on

4651
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:33,999
the beach and exactly how far
apart

4652
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:35,999
umbrellas needed to be

4653
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:37,999
yes the beaches are back open
the

4654
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:39,999
opening beaches is the first
major

4655
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:41,999
easing of greece's coronavirus
lockdown

4656
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:43,999
to date it has had just a
fraction of

4657
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:45,999
the cases of many neighboring
countries

4658
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,999
including turkey

4659
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:49,999
starting tomorrow greeks will
be allowed

4660
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:50,999

welcome

going on it's

4664
02:40:58,000 --> 02:40:58,999
not is underreported nobody
wants to

4665
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:00,999
talk about greece why they have
less

4666
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:01,999
cases 

4667
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:02,999
maybe there's something they're
taking

4668
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,999
they may be taking up a
prophylactic

4669
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:05,999
like uh

4670
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,999
hydroxychloroquine is it
possible nah

4671
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:09,999

doing a run around brazil's
health

4678
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:25,999
minister resigned last night
after just

4679
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:27,999
one month on the job the
shake-up comes

4680
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:29,999
as the number of coronavirus

4681
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:31,999
infections in brazil continues
to rise

4682
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:32,999
nelson taisha did not provide a
reason

4683
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:34,999
for his resignation but it came
just a

4684
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:36,999
day after brazilian president
jair

4685
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:37,999
bolsonaro 

4686
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:38,999
pressured him to accept the use
of

4687
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,999
chloroquine to treat coping 19
patients

4688
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:43,999
the drug which is used to treat
malaria

4689
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:44,999
has been praised as a
therapeutic for

4690
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:46,999
the new disease by bolsonaro and

4691
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:47,999
president trump

4692
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:49,999
though it lacks scientific
support

4693
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:50,999
bullshit 

4694
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:52,999
brazil has become an epicenter
of the

4695
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:54,999
coronavirus outbreak setting
daily

4696
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:56,999
records for infections each of
the last

4697
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:57,999
three days

4698
02:41:58,000 --> 02:41:58,999
on friday the health ministry
confirmed

4699
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:00,999
more than fifteen thousand new

4700
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:01,999
infections 

4701
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:03,999
despite relatively low rates of
testing

4702
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:05,999
if i may compliment you

4703
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,999
it takes a real professional to
hold on

4704
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:09,999
to a

4705
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:11,999

4712
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:24,999
officials said they marked one
full

4713
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:26,999
month with no new cova deaths

4714
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,999
but vulnerable populations like

people on the ground in wuhan

well is that the same guy wrote
as the

4727
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:57,999
note initially when this whole
thing

02:42:58,000 --> 02:42:59,999
broke open yes yes yes yes
that's the

4729
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:01,999
guy yeah

we're good we have some of the
best i

4731
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:04,999

02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,999
didn't miss any of these uh at
the

4733
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:08,999
worsting home

4734
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,999
nursing home the wuhan i want
to thank

4735
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:12,999
dr disorder for uh

4736
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:14,999
sending us our no agenda mask
not the

4737
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:16,999
ones we ordered but he there
was a

4738
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:18,999
cancellation so he sent

4739
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,999
the keeper wants the 1984 mask
which is

4740
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:22,999
coming i hope

4741
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:24,999
she wants to proudly wear that
which is

4742
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:26,999
a good one

4743
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,999
um i think yeah

4744
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,999
these are all be good i do i
could play

4745
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:33,999
a little moro with the biden i
could

4746
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:35,999
play the shields and brooks on
the pbh

4747
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:36,999
resources 

4748
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:38,999
let's get out of here on
something happy

4749
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:39,999
that's happy

4750
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:43,999
okay what is it it's

4751
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,999
just too depressing from the
same side

4752
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:47,999
of the political agenda

4753
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,999
standing in their in their
homes and one

4754
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:52,999
of them worried sick the other
one too

4755
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:53,999
old to care

4756
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:55,999
let's listen to shields and
brooks uh

4757
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:57,999
and it reveals that joe biden

4758
02:43:58,000 --> 02:43:59,999
is a very transparent person
the the

4759
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:01,999
culture they describe is
certainly the

4760
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:02,999
culture i knew when i was

4761
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,999
covering senator biden and the
person i

4762
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:06,999
know him to be and

4763
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:08,999
it raises more skepticism about
the

4764
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:09,999
claims 

4765
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:11,999
i would say this and in
addition there's

4766
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:13,999
a politico report looking into
some of

4767
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:15,999
terrorite's past allegations in
other

4768
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,999
cases other parts of her life

4769
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,999
and i think the bottom line is
if you

4770
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:21,999
were a person who was

4771
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,999
saying should this issue be a
problem

4772
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:25,999
for me in voting

4773
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:27,999
for joe biden i think the arrow
has

4774
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,999
moved into less of a problem we
don't

4775
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:30,999
know that it didn't happen

4776
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,999
we we can't know that but
certainly the

4777
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:34,999
um 

4778
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:35,999
the degree of skepticism has to
be a

4779
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:39,999
little higher because of this
reporting

4780
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:40,999
and mark i mean you're somebody
who's

4781
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:42,999
covered the city for a long
time you've

4782
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:43,999
walked the halls of the

4783
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:45,999
the senate office buildings but
what do

4784
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,999
you come away with here

4785
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,999
well i come away first of all
with great

4786
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:52,999
admiration for both police and
dan

4787
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,999
i mean 74 people on the record
uh is

4788
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:56,999
remarkable that

4789
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:58,999
meant a couple hundred calls
they had to

4790
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,999
make uh to get that

4791
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:03,999
okay now what i wanted to while
i played

4792
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:04,999
that clip because i was gonna
play a

4793
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:06,999
series of clips where they pbs
i'll

4794
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,999
play maybe play it next
thursday they

4795
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:11,999
took their two lisa desjardins
some

4796
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:12,999
other guy

4797
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,999
and they went and they
investigated lisa

4798
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:16,999
is not a yes

4799
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:20,999
they spent a fortune um

4800
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:22,999
investigating the tara reads
story by

4801
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:24,999
talking to old staffers and
they talked

4802
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:25,999
it they tried to

4803
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,999
contact 200 people and they
contacted 75

4804
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:29,999
and got

4805
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,999
or got 75 on the record and

4806
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:34,999
shields is impressive they got
75 people

4807
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:35,999
on the record to

4808
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,999
to do full interviews and i'm
as i'm

4809
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:39,999
listening to the one overlooked

4810
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:43,999
fact here is that the new york
times and

4811
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:44,999
the washington post

4812
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,999
do stories with nobody on the
record

4813
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:49,999
they don't talk to 200 people
right

4814
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:51,999
they don't talk to anybody and
they have

4815
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:53,999
just as sources somebody thinks
that

4816
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:54,999
somebody heard

4817
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:55,999
somebody else said something
about

4818
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:57,999
something no they talked to the
campaign

4819
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:58,999
about it that

4820
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:00,999
that's what they did and they
removed a

4821
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:02,999
part of their reporting that
talked

4822
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:03,999
about the pattern of him

4823
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:05,999
fondling and touching people
which was

4824
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,999
not a problem at all

4825
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:13,999
so you end up with the anomaly
where pbs

4826
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,999
just a tv show it's not even
any good

4827
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:17,999
anymore 

4828
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,999
get 75 people to talk on their
record

4829
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:22,999
about a specific thing

4830
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:24,999
and the newspapers who have
people that

4831
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:26,999
are supposed to be doing this
making a

4832
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:27,999
lot of phone calls

4833
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:29,999
they get nobody for anything
it's

4834
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:31,999
unbelievable 

4835
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:32,999
well i just thought it was it
was

4836
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:34,999
remarkable that then pbs they

4837
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:35,999
why they have to do that many
people

4838
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:36,999
what was that what are they
trying to

4839
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:37,999
prove 

4840
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:39,999
and did they talk about any of
their

4841
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:40,999
research or is that the series
of clips

4842
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:41,999
you want to do that on

4843
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:42,999
you want to do that now the
series of

4844
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:44,999
clips well yeah we have time
i'll do the

4845
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:46,999
series of clubs let's start
there's only

4846
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:47,999
three of them okay

4847
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:49,999
and the the longest one is the
first one

4848
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:51,999
and we'll play that two months
ago

4849
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,999
allegations arose accusing
former vice

4850
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:56,999
president joe biden of sexual
assault

4851
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,999
tara reid who in 1993 worked in
the

4852
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:00,999
office of

4853
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:02,999
then senator biden said that he

4854
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:04,999
assaulted her

4855
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:06,999
biden has categorically denied
the

4856
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:07,999
allegations which now face

4857
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,999
examination from the public our
own dan

4858
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:12,999
bush and lisa desjardins

4859
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,999
did extensive reporting talking
to 74

4860
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,999
former biden staffers to learn
more

4861
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:19,999
about the vice president

4862
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:21,999
the culture in his offices and
their

4863
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:23,999
thoughts on the allegations

4864
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:25,999
the two join me now to share
what

4865
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:27,999
they've learned hello to both
of you

4866
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:29,999
and i'm going to turn to you
both but

4867
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:30,999
lisa 

4868
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:34,999
to you to begin take us through
what you

4869
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:34,999
did 

4870
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,999
and and what you learned in all
from

4871
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:38,999
talking to all these people

4872
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,999
yeah judy we reached out to uh
tried to

4873
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:43,999
reach out to some 200 former
biden

4874
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:44,999
staffers 

4875
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:46,999
of that we were able to have
in-depth

4876
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:48,999
interviews with some 74 of them

4877
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:50,999
now 62 of these former staffers
were

4878
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:51,999
women 

4879
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,999
and to a person judy those
women told us

4880
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:55,999
they had never had

4881
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:57,999
any experience that was
uncomfortable

4882
02:47:58,000 --> 02:47:59,999
with the former vice president
or had

4883
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:00,999
ever heard of any experience it
was

4884
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:01,999
uncomfortable 

4885
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,999
or worse many of them said they
had

4886
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:06,999
spent time with him alone

4887
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:08,999
during work hours and that they
had they

4888
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:10,999
wanted to say that they

4889
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:12,999
most of them didn't want to
reflect on

4890
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:13,999
whether what tara reed is
saying is true

4891
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:14,999
or not

4892
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:16,999
but they did say that it did
not reflect

4893
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:18,999
their experiences at all

4894
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:20,999
especially in a workplace that
dan and i

4895
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:22,999
both heard from them

4896
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:24,999
they felt empowered women
that's right

4897
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:26,999
lisa i would add to that also
that a lot

4898
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:27,999
of the former staffers

4899
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:29,999
we spoke to said that while
they never

4900
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:31,999
felt uncomfortable

4901
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,999
they did confirm what we all
know about

4902
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:35,999
joe biden which is

4903
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,999
his history his habit of
reaching out

4904
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:40,999
making physical contact with
people he

4905
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:42,999
speaks to touching them we
spoke to

4906
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:44,999
people who said at the time of
this it

4907
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:46,999
was known about biden

4908
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:48,999
that he would rub your
shoulders squeeze

4909
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:50,999
your shoulders give people hugs

4910
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:52,999
and kisses and again while the
people we

4911
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:54,999
spoke to said that they
themselves

4912
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:55,999
didn't feel uncomfortable

4913
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,999
they did acknowledge that vice
former

4914
02:48:59,000 --> 02:48:59,999
vice president

4915
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,999
biden doesn't seem to have
strong

4916
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,999
a strong social signal in terms
of when

4917
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:06,999
that kind of contact

4918
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,999
is wanted or not that came up
last year

4919
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:10,999
on the campaign trail

4920
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,999
and now again here oh

4921
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,999
man now they did dig up two

4922
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,999
interesting little tidbits
which are i

4923
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:20,999
don't know if they're important
or not

4924
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:21,999
and they're trying to they're
really

4925
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:23,999
going out of their way to
protect biden

4926
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:24,999
so 

4927
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:26,999
is the candidate let's face it
no

4928
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:28,999
kidding yeah let's listen to

4929
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,999
clip two and lisa you also uh
uncovered

4930
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:32,999
frankly 

4931
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,999
new details that reflect on
tara reed's

4932
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:36,999
allegation that

4933
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:38,999
she says she was forced out of
the

4934
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:40,999
office because she

4935
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:42,999
complained about uh being
uncomfortable

4936
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:44,999
about this sexual

4937
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,999
uh incident uh tell us exactly
what you

4938
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:49,999
learned about that and why it
matters

4939
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:51,999
well tara reid said that she
complained

4940
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:53,999
about previous sexual harassment

4941
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:55,999
in the office and that after she

4942
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:57,999
complained 

4943
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,999
she says she was retaliated
against and

4944
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,999
for in a couple of ways and
that that

4945
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:05,999
eventually forced her out of
the office

4946
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:07,999
we spoke to the man who shared
an office

4947
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:08,999
with her

4948
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:10,999
his name is ben savage they
worked

4949
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:11,999
together on constituent

4950
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,999
mail ben savage told us that

4951
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,999
actually it was a performance
problem

4952
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:18,999
with tara reid

4953
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,999
that he himself raised two
supervisors

4954
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:22,999
in some cases he said

4955
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:24,999
she was throwing out constituent

4956
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:26,999
important records of
constituent mail

4957
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:28,999
and that the problem was bad
enough that

4958
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:30,999
he raised it to supervisors

4959
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:32,999
he believes that's why she left
and

4960
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:33,999
here's some of the interview
that i had

4961
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:35,999
with him over the phone

4962
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:37,999
and of all the people who held
that

4963
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:39,999
position she's the only one
during my

4964
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:40,999
time there

4965
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,999
who couldn't necessarily keep
up who

4966
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:45,999
felt or who found it frustrating

4967
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:46,999
we of course reached out to
tara reed

4968
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:48,999
she declined our request for an

4969
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:49,999
interview but her

4970
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:50,999
attorney did give us detailed
responses

4971
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:52,999
to our questions among them

4972
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,999
to this exact issue he said
that story

4973
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:56,999
is flat wrong

4974
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:58,999
here is what doug wigtor wrote
us in

4975
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:00,999
response he wrote miss reed
recalls that

4976
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:02,999
there was a lot of nitpicking
regarding

4977
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:04,999
her performance in the office

4978
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:05,999
she was also very nervous at
that point

4979
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:07,999
and distracted so it's possible
that

4980
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:09,999
from time to time there was a
mistake

4981
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:09,999
made 

4982
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:11,999
but her performance had nothing
to do

4983
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:13,999
with her termination

4984
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,999
and judy we do know that reed
worked in

4985
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:17,999
that office for about nine
months

4986
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:19,999
wait a minute she says she was
i thought

4987
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:23,999
she left she was terminated

4988
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:27,999
yeah um well then there's a
then there's

4989
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:28,999
a termination letter and there's

4990
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:29,999
something there that i have

4991
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:31,999
somebody's to have some
documentation

4992
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:32,999
for this and by the way

4993
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:34,999
how what kind of a job are you

through mail

5003
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,999
no no there's no package but
there's a

5004
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:54,999
little bit of a package in this
last

5005
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,999
clip where this guy goes on to

5006
02:51:58,000 --> 02:51:59,999
which i have to explain after
the

5007
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:01,999
presentation this is the

5008
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,999
part three and and dan you also
learned

5009
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:04,999
uh 

5010
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,999
new information from reed's
attorney

5011
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,999
about the location that tara
reid

5012
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,999
says is where joe biden
assaulted her so

5013
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:15,999
tell us about that

5014
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:17,999
that's right judy reid's
attorney

5015
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:19,999
provided us with new information

5016
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,999
about this assault this alleged
assault

5017
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,999
saying that reid claims that it
took

5018
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:26,999
place somewhere between

5019
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:28,999
the russell building where
biden had an

5020
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:29,999
office at the time

5021
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:31,999
and the u.s capitol building we
want to

5022
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:32,999
show you

5023
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,999
what these spaces look like so
this is

5024
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:37,999
the hallway where biden's
office was

5025
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:39,999
it's essentially unchanged to
now

5026
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,999
to get to the capitol you go
down a

5027
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:43,999
flight of stairs

5028
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:45,999
and then take a tunnel where
there's a

5029
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:47,999
subway that takes lawmakers to
the

5030
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:48,999
capital 

5031
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:50,999
building now anybody who has
been to

5032
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:52,999
this part of the capital knows
that

5033
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:54,999
there are a lot of people
moving through

5034
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,999
these spaces especially when
congress is

5035
02:52:58,000 --> 02:52:57,999
in session

5036
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,999
lawmakers their aides reporters
there's

5037
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:02,999
a police presence

5038
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:04,999
as well and what a lot of these
former

5039
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:05,999
biden staffers told us

5040
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:09,999
is look these are public places
uh

5041
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:11,999
if this allegation is true if
it took

5042
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:12,999
place it would have been

5043
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,999
extremely brazen judy because
the

5044
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:16,999
likelihood 

5045
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:17,999
that it would have been seen by
someone

5046
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:19,999
was very high

5047
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,999
man if well i

5048
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:24,999
gotta give you an explanation
of what

5049
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:26,999
these showed first he showed
the big

5050
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:27,999
long hallway

5051
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,999
there was nobody there then he
showed a

5052
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:31,999
spot where there's that little

5053
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:33,999
little subway system and
there's a crowd

5054
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:35,999
there and then he showed
another shot

5055
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:35,999
there was

5056
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,999
zero people he's going on and
on about

5057
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:39,999
all the people

5058
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:41,999
in these photos helping the
empty photo

5059
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:43,999
empty empty corridors

5060
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:47,999
well um i don't know what
happened we

5061
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:49,999
we will not know we'll never
know

5062
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:50,999
believe all women

5063
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,999
whatever uh the fact of the
matter is

5064
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:54,999
look here's the deal

5065
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,999
joe biden is not qualified to
run for

5066
02:53:58,000 --> 02:53:58,999
anything 

5067
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,999
it's a sham i don't know what's
going on

5068
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:02,999
i don't know why they're doing
this

5069
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:06,999
it makes no sense and i would

5070
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:08,999
hope that we remember the
people who

5071
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:09,999
were speaking so

5072
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,999
glowingly and lovingly about
joe biden

5073
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,999
about his experience and what a
great

5074
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:17,999
president he'll make

5075
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,999
in these days specifically
because i'd

5076
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:21,999
like to talk to those people

5077
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,999
after whatever happens happens
because

5078
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:26,999
it'll become apparent that this
was a

5079
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,999
scam whether he gets in office
or not is

5080
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,999
going to be a parent

5081
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:33,999
yeah i don't get it personally
i don't

5082
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:35,999
know what what's the point of it

5083
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:37,999
unless it's just to put
somebody in the

5084
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:39,999
vice president's slot that you
know you

5085
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:40,999
can't get elected

5086
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:42,999
uh amy klobuchar be a good
example no

5087
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:44,999
one's voting for her she did
poorly in

5088
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:45,999
all the

5089
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,999
uh primaries uh but you can get
her in

5090
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:49,999
as president and she'd be a good

5091
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:50,999
bureaucrat 

5092
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:52,999
and as long as she's a
globalist it's

5093
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:54,999
good to go

5094
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:56,999
i mean they're trying to get a
globalist

5095
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:57,999
back in the in the office and
get back

5096
02:54:58,000 --> 02:54:59,999
on track here of

5097
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,999
turning the country over or
national

5098
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:03,999
sovereignty should be turned
over to a

5099
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:05,999
one-world government that's
obviously

5100
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:06,999
what's going on

5101
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:07,999
and there are people that
advocate for

5102
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:09,999
that and that's the corona
thing is all

5103
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:10,999
about that

5104
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:14,999
well i i i think joe biden is
right i

5105
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:15,999
think he's very smart he stays
in his

5106
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:17,999
basement i think it's very

5107
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:19,999
uh intelligent of his campaign
they do

5108
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:20,999
not let

5109
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,999
any outsiders in from comcast
or any

5110
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:24,999
smart people who are going to
come in

5111
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:25,999
and fix their sound

5112
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,999
because the likelihood of him
being

5113
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,999
killed is high right now

5114
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:33,999
certainly in the corona period
we'd have

5115
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:34,999
a great excuse

5116
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:36,999
i i fear for joe's life at this
point

5117
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:37,999
there's no way

5118
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:39,999
anyone who was running any show
at the

5119
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:41,999
democratic national party or the

5120
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:43,999
democratic party

5121
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:44,999
thinks that this guy is
actually going

5122
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:46,999
to be something worth anything
as a

5123
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:47,999
president 

5124
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:49,999
it's just i i i just totally

5125
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:51,999
disagreement with you

5126
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:52,999
you're speaking from a logical

5127
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,999
perspective as if the democrats
are

5128
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,999
logical i'm i'm waiting for you

5129
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,999
i i just think they're
illogical i think

5130
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:02,999
they're they're sincere

5131
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:03,999
i think they sincerely think
this guy's

5132
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:05,999
going to be a great president

5133
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:07,999
they're keeping most of the
gaffes out

5134
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:09,999
of the public eye so that so
the public

5135
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:10,999
doesn't notice

5136
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:12,999
and so we can get in they they
believe

5137
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:14,999
their own publicity so when
they see a

5138
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:15,999
washington 

5139
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:17,999
post poll that says that
biden's going

5140
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:19,999
to beat trump by 10 points they
all

5141
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:21,999
i think they believe it i don't
think

5142
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:23,999
they they think that is bull
crap

5143
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:25,999
i think well this guy's a
winner this

5144
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:27,999
guy can beat trump that's all
we want

5145
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:28,999
this guy can beat trump yeah
maybe he

5146
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:30,999
won't be the best guy

5147
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:31,999
but he can beat trump and he's
a good

5148
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:33,999
guy he's one of ours he's one
of our

5149
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:35,999
guys and he's next on the list
and he's

5150
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:35,999
the guys

5151
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,999
up next up the bat no matter
what

5152
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:39,999
strategy you look at

5153
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,999
it's apparent that uh people
are being

5154
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:43,999
chosen around him

5155
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,999
or so or selected or people are
getting

5156
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:47,999
ready in case

5157
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,999
he either dies in office and

5158
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,999
okay we disagree on this but
the way

5159
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:54,999
this is being run

5160
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:56,999
and if you're telling me that
the people

5161
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:58,999
who run the dnc i'm not talking
about

5162
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:00,999
democrats i'm talking about the

5163
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:02,999
the prostitutes on television
they're

5164
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:03,999
just doing what they're told to
do i'm

5165
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:05,999
sure they believe

5166
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:06,999
but this to me sounds like a
setup for

5167
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,999
someone who is not nominated
someone who

5168
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:09,999
is not running

5169
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:11,999
someone who is going to have to
come in

5170
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:13,999
and save the day when something
bad

5171
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:14,999
happens to joe

5172
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:16,999
that is a scenario that has to
be looked

5173
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,999
at well that brings hillary
back into

5174
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:19,999
the mix

5175
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:21,999
thank you very much that's all
i can

5176
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:22,999
think of

5177
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,999
and if if not that then yeah
then people

5178
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:26,999
are just

5179
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:28,999
delusional because this man is
not

5180
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:29,999
appropriate 

5181
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:32,999
for any kind of public office
the right

5182
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:33,999
word 

5183
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,999
any kind of public office well
hillary

5184
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:37,999
again is the one that

5185
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:39,999
could be targeting the whole
thing she

5186
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:41,999
could be behind everything i
mean their

5187
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:43,999
their machine still exists

5188
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:45,999
and there's a lot of support
for it and

5189
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:47,999
it i think the general public
in the

5190
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:48,999
united states will get

5191
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,999
extremely irked at this point

5192
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,999
if hillary swoops in because i
i think

5193
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:55,999
they're going to see

5194
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:57,999
the whole thing was it was a
setup

5195
02:57:58,000 --> 02:57:59,999
what's the point what is that
what's

5196
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:00,999
