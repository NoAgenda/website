00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,650
Something's wrong with that
horn. This is going off the

19
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,250
rails.

20
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,040
John C Dvorak: Do you remember a
real one here somewhere?

21
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,219
Adam Curry: Do you remember?
When I wanted to quit it

22
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:09,209
episode? 100.

23
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,410
John C Dvorak: Oh, yeah, yeah,
you was like this? Well, we got

24
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,710
to show 100 I think Greg was a
good run.

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,360
Adam Curry: We had a good run.

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,800
John C Dvorak: And then my
comment was What are you nuts?

27
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,290
Adam Curry: Now? You said, Come
on, son. Stick with it. I'll

28
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,260
make you rich. I'll make you
leave your wife rich. And I left

29
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:35,400
my wife but I didn't get rich.
Yeah. You remember you said

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:35,670
that?

31
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,770
John C Dvorak: The I don't
remember any of it. I just

32
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,130
remembered that it wasn't going
to happen. What wasn't going to

33
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,240
happen? That you're going to
quit and showed 100 now? No, you

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,560
wouldn't let me you wouldn't let
me then. You're a pushover you

35
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,770
Adam Curry: know you even got me
me on the phone and got her to

36
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,160
Candela?

37
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,390
Unknown: Yes, you do.

38
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,790
Adam Curry: What do you mean? I
remember.

39
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,880
John C Dvorak: You gotta keep
doing this show. I don't

40
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:02,729
Adam Curry: know. That's not the
way she said it. She said

41
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,939
Please, I gotta keep John busy.
Please keep

42
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,140
John C Dvorak: that's always
possible.

43
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,480
Adam Curry: And I realized, you
know, 1600 episodes and still

44
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,720
people just you know, we've
we've we've taught them nothing.

45
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,410
They're all spun up in the
world. Everybody's all crazy.

46
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:22,650
It's

47
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,210
John C Dvorak: 1500 or 1600
episodes of utility.

48
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,670
Adam Curry: It seems that there
you go. That is it. How utility

49
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,490
John C Dvorak: show title if
utility. Let me write that

50
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,450
utility.

51
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,820
Adam Curry: It's unbelievable.
It really is. You know, it's

52
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,810
like, I mean, we're all wars
bad. But we've been through so

53
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,400
many wars on this show. This one
seems particularly polarizing.

54
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,790
You know, you have to choose a
side. You got to have an

55
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,960
opinion. You got to let that
opinion be known. That's for

56
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,110
sure. Gotta let it be Buddha
daddy opinion be known. Actually

57
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,700
got a nice email from Tom.

58
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,500
John C Dvorak: I have an
opinion. What's your opinion?

59
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,750
And I have clips to go along
with my opinion.

60
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,100
Adam Curry: Because I read this
quick email from Tom. Yes. Read.

61
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,150
Tom says, you know, I started
listening. I started nafcu on

62
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,690
Glenn Beck. I

63
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,820
John C Dvorak: have a waiting
list. Stop, stop. But is this

64
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,680
nasty? Oh,

65
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,330
Adam Curry: no, it's not. No,
it's the opposite. It's

66
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,450
John C Dvorak: open for a nasty
Oh, no, it's

67
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,060
Adam Curry: sick. No, that
people stopped doing that. Like,

68
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,560
when my email right Oh,

69
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,940
John C Dvorak: you're gonna read
it. I know. I

70
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,090
Adam Curry: know. The One. The
One the one person who sent me

71
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,790
that short note like, Yeah, I'm
done. Now then comes back and

72
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,090
sends me did not everybody goes
Eric,

73
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:45,720
John C Dvorak: wasn't it? No.

74
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,630
Adam Curry: Did not everybody
get the 10 minute video of Hamas

75
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,680
violence? I mean, that thing
when that thing went viral has

76
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,800
been pushed real hard. People
just sending it to me. No

77
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,220
subject here. Have a look at
this. What do you call that?

78
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:08,250
Like, yeah, I see horrible
things. I see horrible things.

79
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,660
Although actually, before you
start before you start something

80
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,300
someone pointed something out in
that 10 minute video. This is

81
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,960
the video where ultimately I
think that one the guy who's

82
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,460
filming it gets shot and dies.
You've seen that one Haven't

83
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,980
you? That's part of this 10
minute Compendium.

84
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,830
John C Dvorak: I guess you have
to we know for a fact that he

85
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,370
got shot. You

86
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,180
Adam Curry: know, we don't know
anything. Of course. But in

87
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,760
this, we get that straight. We
don't know anything but in this

88
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,010
video. The filmer of the video
is holding an RPG at the

89
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,760
beginning and then funny Where
did that appear fell? Yeah, I

90
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,840
wonder where that RPG came from?
And he's playing a video game at

91
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,480
the beginning. It's totally look
like a video. All of these shots

92
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,890
with the GoPro cams look like a
first person shooter which, if

93
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,450
not intentional, certainly is
triggering a lot of gamers by A

94
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,030
cool game. So he's on the back
with his RPG. And one of our

95
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:11,850
military people pointed out that
there's a term used right after

96
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,870
the RPG guy jumps the fence. I
guess that would be part of the

97
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,650
security checkpoint. If you can
hear this at a certain point,

98
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,140
the word send it send it or used
to

99
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,920
send it. Send it send it. Yeah.
According to this, our military

100
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,420
person here, boots on the
ground, says that is completely

101
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,670
American terminology for firing
off the RPG send it send it. He

102
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,810
says there's no similar word in
Arabic. I think it sounds kind

103
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,040
of like an American accent when
you hear it. And his final, his

104
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,550
final quote was, well, we'll be
attacking Iran in five days.

105
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,740
This is us. I don't know about
that. But I just thought it was

106
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,750
interesting to send it send it
was in there.

107
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,970
John C Dvorak: Kind of it's just
part of the whole thing. Part of

108
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,880
the whole thing. Exactly. The
Iran thing was the is the right

109
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,560
is the right pick. Yeah.

110
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,300
Adam Curry: So here's just this
one line from Tom. I was

111
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,940
listening to Ben Shapiro every
day as well see, see, this is

112
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:26,760
what happens. Oh, my goodness.
Ben Shapiro. Shapiro needs to

113
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,580
listen to our show. He did a
week of obviously pro Israel,

114
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,730
Israel and reality on the ground
as he was receiving photos and

115
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,950
texts from friends of friends
and family who were there. I

116
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,520
have to admit, I was twisted
around the axle when you all

117
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,980
didn't take aside. But that's
not your gig. I stayed with you

118
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,900
through 1598 and then 1599 After
listening to John's gig on

119
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,650
Trump. Bibi hosed us and
Hezbollah ain't dummies and how

120
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:57,000
perverse and twisted day PBS NPR
reporting on Trump. I got up out

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,240
of the chair went to my 21 year
old daughter and told her don't

122
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,080
believe anything ever hits. So
we've saved not just this one

123
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,130
guy but his daughter as

124
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,090
John C Dvorak: well. So well we
saved him for the moment. Yes,

125
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:12,240
you're

126
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,900
Adam Curry: right momentarily.
There's so many good people who

127
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,460
who stuck with us through COVID
Even could handle Ukraine. And

128
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,170
then this one Oh, no. Now check
it out. Now. Check it out. You

129
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:30,390
guys are glib Cavalier laughing
at death and destruction. Well,

130
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,950
what can I say? What can I tell
you?

131
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,680
John C Dvorak: We're laughing at
the reportage.

132
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,030
Adam Curry: Exactly. The
reportage the teta Tet the real

133
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,380
professional. Sheesh, all of
this all of this stuff. And and

134
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:52,770
we are also here to calm you.
Right? We're calm where we we

135
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,190
intend to have a calming effect
on you to renovate what is

136
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,850
happening because you're in it.
You're affected. You're deeply

137
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:07,320
affected by these videos deeply.
Yes, it's rich. Now this I have

138
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,290
a lot of clips, I see that
there's overlap. So I'll just

139
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,550
let you go. If you

140
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,430
John C Dvorak: really I want to
do my may I'm gonna, I'm not

141
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,860
gonna, well, maybe we can start
with the summaries that are

142
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,300
NBFCs NBC, I gave Garrett top
summary NBC. Well, if you do a

143
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,560
summary, I want to jump right
from the summaries right to the

144
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,730
thesis that we're going to
Iran's a target onto

145
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,050
Adam Curry: proof proofs. Oh,

146
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,860
you got proofs

147
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:39,389
John C Dvorak: of proofs,
proofs. Let's stop, stop, stop.

148
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,679
Where do we stop the war word?
Yes. Where do we start? Let's

149
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,969
stop with this start with top
summary NBC one

150
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,730
Unknown: today President Biden
was here in Israel standing with

151
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,940
its people in the face of
tragedy while across the Arab

152
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,930
world anger rage protests from
the Middle East to Europe. Some

153
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,740
aimed at the US over the deadly
explosion that a Gaza hospital

154
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,980
that Palestinian health
authorities say killed hundreds

155
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,060
and Plame Israel is the culprit.
President Biden however coming

156
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,320
to Israel's defense

157
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:14,009
Adam Curry: just want to stop
here for one second. It's

158
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:19,319
amazing that even our own no
agenda nation are just going ape

159
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:23,819
crap over the hospital. Unto you
Nazis. The hospitals the whole

160
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:29,879
point is, is to divide up my
Lords This has got to be this

161
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:32,579
gotta be there's gotta be no
team, this team that team got to

162
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:40,019
this point. It's the whole point
of the thing people that's the

163
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,659
whole point is to get you to do
that. And we're falling for

164
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,030
John C Dvorak: it saying he was
I actually think it's got a

165
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,780
bigger point. And

166
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,030
Adam Curry: now I'm sure
President Biden

167
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,640
Unknown: however, coming to
Israel's defense, saying he was

168
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,540
deeply saddened and outraged by
the explosion, before declaring

169
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,440
it appears as though it was done
by the other team, blaming the

170
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,950
explosion on a failed rock It
launched by terror group Islamic

171
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,940
Jihad. Israel offering what it
says is evidence it was not

172
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,600
responsible. But pictures of
children in Gaza being rescued

173
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,530
from the rubble of airstrikes
only hardening positions, as the

174
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,460
American President sought to
calm tensions over the October 7

175
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,390
attacks here and avert a
humanitarian disaster in Gaza.

176
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,810
But the diplomatic ground
shifting beneath the President's

177
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,200
feet as he traveled here from
Washington to a war zone

178
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,950
overnight, as Arab leaders were
dropping out of a plan summit

179
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,740
meeting on the crisis. Here's
where we start tonight.

180
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,390
Adam Curry: I love I love all
the military industrial complex

181
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,630
dude showing up all gray hair.
You know, some of them in a

182
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,920
suit? Someone just probably put
on the uniform. An explicit

183
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,090
splaining okay, this is how a
rocket works. This is why it was

184
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:56,580
a rocket. It's like they just
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Let me

185
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,700
explain how this works. People
we have proofs. Yeah, that

186
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,360
summit that kind of gets snowed
under that. Was Biden seriously

187
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,990
thinking that he would have some
kind of summit that wouldn't be

188
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,270
disturbed by I don't know a
rocket.

189
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,580
John C Dvorak: The rocket attack
took place. This is all very

190
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,150
convenient. By the way. Yeah.
The rocket attack took place

191
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,990
while he was in the air. Yeah,
he had already the summers were

192
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,020
all arranged. Yeah. So he's
gonna meet here and there's

193
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,570
gonna go to Jordan who's gonna
meet this guy and that guy. And

194
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,500
so do you ever?

195
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,780
Adam Curry: Ever somewhat clip?

196
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,850
John C Dvorak: No. Well, I don't
I haven't.

197
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,920
Adam Curry: I have an angle
somewhat clip. Just explain who

198
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,510
was supposed to be there. It
might be helpful.

199
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,690
John C Dvorak: Okay, because
because I got angle stuff. Yeah,

200
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,210
Adam Curry: I'm tied into my
thesis. You're driving, you're

201
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,260
driving. I just want I'm

202
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,570
John C Dvorak: only driving so
far, then you're gonna have to,

203
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,650
you are holding

204
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,200
Adam Curry: on to the wheel
right now. Do not take your

205
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,830
hands off at Stevie. Just Just a
little background, because I

206
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,040
thought this was this was not
well explained anywhere. But of

207
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,540
course, Richard Engel, did I
want to

208
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,490
Unknown: briefly turn to
Richard, is that along the west

209
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:04,500
bank there on this issue? That
was not because of this hospital

210
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,830
explosion at the complex, the
hospital complex in Gaza. This

211
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,440
this plan to meet with the
leaders of Egypt, the

212
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,590
Palestinian Authority, as well
as the King of Jordan fell

213
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,160
apart.

214
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,830
John C Dvorak: Do you notice
Hold on a second. Do you notice

215
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:22,350
they all call it an explosion?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yes, instead of

216
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,180
attack or rocking?

217
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,930
Adam Curry: Because that's the
message they've been given.

218
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,890
They're totally see, by

219
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,510
John C Dvorak: the way, I should
mention as you play this clip,

220
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,350
I'm gonna have no I have backup
clip to prove it. NBC is all in

221
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,620
on the fact that Israel did the
bombing, oh, MSNBC is

222
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,090
Adam Curry: off the hook with us

223
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,340
Unknown: plan to meet with the
leaders of Egypt, the

224
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,460
Palestinian Authority, as well
as the King of Jordan fell

225
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,300
apart. And the art of that
meeting, Richard was to try to

226
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,630
stop this from becoming a wider
conflict in the middle of so we

227
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,420
have before the President
speaks. What are the prospects

228
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,230
of that now?

229
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,060
Well, now? Well, it

230
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,790
was a disaster. They were
supposed to be this peace summit

231
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,570
with US allies, Mahmoud Abbas,
the moderate leader of the

232
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:08,580
Palestinians, in contrast to
Hamas, the leader of Egypt, the

233
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,560
King of Jordan, but after this
hospital attack, the the those

234
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,560
in attendance decided, in their
words that it would not be

235
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,960
productive to to hold the
summit. But

236
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,840
Adam Curry: that's interesting,
because you hear you hear angle

237
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,880
clearly saying not explosion
after this hospital attack. So

238
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,650
he is definitely not leaving any
room for it to be a Hamas failed

239
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:36,030
rocket launch. So there's
backing up your NBC thesis,

240
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,730
Unknown: Palestinians felt that
they could not be there. We had

241
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,790
Mahmoud Abbas, walk out of this
meeting leave Jordan that they

242
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,050
could not be seen standing next
to President Biden, who's done

243
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,580
nothing but support Israel give
a full personal support

244
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,400
expressing support of the United
States is giving military

245
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,160
support to Israel sending
weapons here there are US

246
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,750
military advisors on the ground.
These leaders felt it this time

247
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,830
after this incident which as
Kelly was describing are under

248
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,080
disputed circumstances couldn't
be there sitting next to the

249
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,440
President.

250
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,740
Adam Curry: Hey man wasn't NBC
owned by GE at one point am I am

251
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,040
I am I mistaken that no you're
not mistaken at all. Yeah,

252
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,100
because they would not have done
this this report back when GE

253
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,450
owned them. I wouldn't think so.
No Military Industrial Complex

254
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,680
company Corporation. All right.
Back to your thesis I'm sorry I

255
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,280
just needed to

256
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,120
John C Dvorak: do you want to
interrupt all you can I just to

257
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,860
go and I did takes me a little
bit aside. I want to play I want

258
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,590
to jump to clips there and I'm
gonna go to this one because you

259
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:43,530
just play that clip jump. That
clip. Jump in the clip. This is

260
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,970
the hospital NBC take side with
Jordan.

261
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,020
Adam Curry: Yes, I got it here.
I got I got it

262
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,960
Unknown: today. And now let's
see Egypt's president will allow

263
00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:00,120
20 trucks of aid into Gaza. What
he would do is open the gate The

264
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,290
plan summit with Arab leaders in
Jordan was scrapped after the

265
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,920
hospital explosion and the
announcement that Palestinian

266
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,060
leader Abbas would not attend.
Was there important work though

267
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,240
that didn't get done the fact
that summit didn't take place?

268
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:20,280
A lot of important work. I mean,
we all did. The only item in the

269
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,390
agenda right now is to stop this
this madness and stop the

270
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,230
killing that civilians are
paying the utmost price.

271
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,460
Tonight, I spoke with Jordans
Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi as

272
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,730
you know President Biden, the US
they take the position that this

273
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:41,100
was not an Israeli strike, but
the result of other Palestinian

274
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,140
militants. Do you believe that
to be the case?

275
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,710
Sir, nobody's buying that that
narrative in this part of the

276
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:52,440
world the the reality does
really harm us army is not very

277
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,380
credible in this part of the
world as well. The only way that

278
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,650
people would entertain a
different narrative is if there

279
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:03,120
is an independent international
inquiry into into into into the

280
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,140
tragedy that has happened with
impeccable evidence that it was

281
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,970
it was not Israel.

282
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,740
Adam Curry: Yes. And in the blue
helmets, we need an

283
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,610
investigation.

284
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,700
John C Dvorak: Go to this clip
now, which is hospital video

285
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,720
timestamp.

286
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,780
Adam Curry: Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

287
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,870
Unknown: President Biden's in
Israel hours after Palestinian

288
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,860
officials accused Israel of
killing at least 500 people at

289
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,390
Gaza's athlete Baptist Hospital
and an airstrike. In addition to

290
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,150
treating sick and wounded
patients. The hospital was

291
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:40,020
acting as a refuge for displaced
Gazans fleeing Israel's

292
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,040
unrelenting attacks. This is
Mohammed Al Naka, a doctor at

293
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,300
the hospital.

294
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:50,760
lumea Munna Musa there was no
warning before the hospital was

295
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,360
targeted. There were about 3000
people who were taking shelter

296
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,570
here while we were working at
the hospital and without any

297
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:01,200
warning there on 6:30pm. The
hospital was targeted by

298
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,470
shelling. We didn't know what it
was, but we found out what it

299
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,470
can do after it targeted
children who were cut into

300
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,100
pieces.

301
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:12,059
guises Health Ministry said
Israel told the hospital that

302
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:16,829
had sent warning strikes one day
before the deadly explosion. The

303
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:21,269
UN has called for an immediate
humanitarian ceasefire amidst

304
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:25,739
international condemnation over
the attack. Israel's denied

305
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:30,029
responsibility blaming a
Palestinian Islamic Jihad

306
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:35,249
rocket. Israeli officials appear
to have deleted a video posted

307
00:17:35,249 --> 00:17:39,689
on social media showing
Palestinian rockets being fired

308
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:43,739
after realizing the timestamp on
the footage did not match up

309
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:45,329
with the hospital attack.

310
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,690
Adam Curry: Again this whatever
you do, make sure you do

311
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,950
forensic investigations on this
hospital attack. Please, let's

312
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,980
keep that go on people. This is
good keep everybody occupied and

313
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,360
John C Dvorak: less billing on
this one more along this lines

314
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,120
along these lines and then I
want to add one comment and I

315
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,810
want to get to the

316
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,440
Adam Curry: clips. I'm ready.
I'm waiting for you. Hospital to

317
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:07,860
Biden

318
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,120
John C Dvorak: canceled opinion.

319
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,580
Unknown: A planned trip to
Jordan as part of President

320
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,330
Biden's visit to the Middle East
was cancelled in the wake of the

321
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,470
hospital bombing. Biden said he
was outraged by the attack which

322
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,680
constitutes a war crime but
sided with Israel as he made

323
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,190
remarks alongside Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu earlier

324
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:26,850
today.

325
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,710
I'm deeply saddened and outraged
by the explosion at the hospital

326
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,430
and Gaza yesterday. And based on
what I've seen, it appears as

327
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,280
though it was done by the other
team not.

328
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Many have pointed out that
militant groups and Palestine do

329
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,970
not have the firepower to level
a massive building. Israel has a

330
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,260
history of lying about its
responsibility against

331
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,370
Palestinian civilians, including
the murder of Palestinian

332
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,300
American journalist Shireen a
black lab last year, which it

333
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,710
initially blamed on
Palestinians. Israel apologized

334
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,810
a year after her death man did

335
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,360
Adam Curry: Amy just say those
Jews be lying? Is that what she

336
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,130
just said? Wow. Yeah,

337
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,640
John C Dvorak: well, he had
cutters lurking in that

338
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,420
operation

339
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,290
Adam Curry: gutter got her get
it right. Gutter gutter. Yeah.

340
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,950
All right. Take us back to the
Okay. So

341
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,200
John C Dvorak: let's go to now
want to go to let's go to that

342
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,840
this is my thesis is I've known
to begin with 12345 clips, which

343
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,780
kind of indicate that we are we
sent the two carrier groups

344
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,280
Strike Forces strike force to
the areas we are going to end

345
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,300
this the last two on the list of
the of the West Clarke seven are

346
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,500
Lebanon, Lebanon

347
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,890
Adam Curry: and Iran, Iran and
we have we have already prepared

348
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,070
everything else right. We've got
every other one including so

349
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,370
more

350
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:53,910
John C Dvorak: or less.

351
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,430
Adam Curry: Syria, Syria.

352
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,980
John C Dvorak: Come on, into
Syria. It which brings us back

353
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,880
to those hospitals for now. Who
benefited from the hospital

354
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,740
strike? Who bent up that's what
you maybe logically fear who did

355
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,280
the hospital strike by figuring
out who benefited okay. And and

356
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,870
on the surface it seems as if
the beneficiary what are the

357
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,810
Arabs because they get to use it
as a talking point? Yes,

358
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,600
Adam Curry: like they killed
children. Right.

359
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:30,090
John C Dvorak: But on the other
hand, if Israel doesn't want any

360
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,090
peace whatsoever, and they've
been talking about saber

361
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:36,480
rattling about Iran the whole
time, wouldn't it make more

362
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,010
sense for them to do it let the
Arabs you know chirp about it

363
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:46,110
and then meanwhile, plan to
trigger Iran into doing

364
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:50,550
something stupid. So we says we
got to strike forces there we

365
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:56,160
have to now we we the United
States now have to put boots on

366
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,490
the ground? Or is there anyone
into who would indicate this

367
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,040
kind of get me to give us a
heads up because we look for him

368
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,100
for kind of information that
comes from the sources? Let's go

369
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,110
to Richard Engel one Oh, I'm

370
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,630
Adam Curry: sorry. I was
starting with Richard angle one.

371
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,520
Yes. Here we go. spook a boy.

372
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,260
Unknown: Nice. The explosion
that has shaken the Middle East

373
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:19,950
New Video shows that deadly
explosion at a hospital in Gaza

374
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:25,380
City that reportedly killed
hundreds and sparked protests

375
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:33,420
from Iran to Yemen, to Lebanon,
where demonstrators directed

376
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,930
their anger against the United
States, Israel's main backer.

377
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,810
Security forces in Beirut used
water cannons and tear gas to

378
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,860
disperse crowds outside the US
Embassy. The United States

379
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,400
pulled out of it scores in the
Middle East, but now could be

380
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,080
heading back into work. In the
West Bank, Palestinians today

381
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,370
dragged out the barricades and
slung rocks at Israeli soldiers.

382
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,480
There weren't many, mostly
teenagers, Israeli troops kept

383
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,240
their distance. But when the
stone throwers got too close to

384
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,400
soldiers opened fire, sending
medical crews rushing in. And

385
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,790
here's one more injured being
taken away. Israelis are picking

386
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:25,440
them off with what appears to be
rubber bullets at this stage. No

387
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,920
one was seriously injured here
today. But a new generation of

388
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,940
Palestinians is taking to the
streets. While Israel and Hamas

389
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,030
are blaming each other for the
hospital explosion. A new

390
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:40,440
Palestinian uprising could be
starting today. Our crew filmed

391
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,220
at the Gaza hospital site. And
so families collecting what they

392
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,420
could from the debris.

393
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,190
Adam Curry: All right, you rang
your bell twice, a

394
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,360
John C Dvorak: couple of hints
there. There's going to be hit

395
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:58,050
there using rubber bullets. Now
was it for time being as a hint

396
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,530
before that was there's going to
be a wider war but he gets a

397
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,600
little more specific here and
clipped to

398
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,530
Unknown: Iran, which backs both
Hamas and Hezbollah is working

399
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:13,410
to fan the rage even further
Fanning. Ron's President calling

400
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:17,310
on Muslim nations to isolate
Israel, impose an oil embargo

401
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,930
and bring revenge.

402
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,460
Richer the size of those crowds
you're seeing does say something

403
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,980
about the impact of this
hospital explosion.

404
00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:29,189
It may be that we're not
millions of people on the

405
00:23:29,189 --> 00:23:31,919
streets across the Arab world.
But I can tell you, Lester,

406
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,069
there are real and growing
concerns here that this is

407
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:37,949
headed to the REIT toward a
regional war, Lester,

408
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,750
Adam Curry: regional war

409
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,370
John C Dvorak: in the region. So
now we go to we go to the clip

410
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:47,310
that's there. I have a bunch of
clips about all the protests all

411
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:50,400
over the place. Yes, he's the
one that relates to this this

412
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,250
thesis protests in Iran.

413
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:57,779
Adam Curry: Yes. And this has
been going on protests in Iran,

414
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:58,889
the whole country.

415
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:02,159
Unknown: Yes. So also protests
against Israel and the US in all

416
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,519
major cities across Iran.
President Abraham Lacey spoke at

417
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:08,519
a rally in Tehran, where he
warned the situation in Gaza

418
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,119
risks spiraling out of control,
and said aid must be allowed in

419
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:13,409
Tulsa Jabari, has there

420
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,920
been a day of solidarity with
the Palestinian people across

421
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:21,360
Iran as a number of rallies took
place in all the major cities

422
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,330
across the country. It was
declared a Day of Mourning by

423
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,050
the government and in the
demonstrations here taking place

424
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,950
in Tehran. The Iranian President
Ibrahim Bracy, made an

425
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:35,580
appearance and delivered a
speech during which he condemned

426
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:39,390
the Israeli aggression. And he
also blamed the United States.

427
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,300
Adam Curry: And they raised the
Black Flag, Black Flag but the

428
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:45,930
Black Flag

429
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,910
John C Dvorak: didn't get to
black.

430
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,010
Adam Curry: Oh, yeah, they
raised the Black Flag. Yeah,

431
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,050
that means it's time to go
crazy.

432
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,440
John C Dvorak: So they go crazy.
And they said that, you know,

433
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,650
they, they want they want us to
You know, the Palestinians have

434
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:08,010
got to get support, they gotta
get relief and stuff has got to

435
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:11,520
go in there. And so there's been
hemming and hawing and now

436
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,440
they're working on the road,
they still haven't gotten that

437
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,620
clear. And all of this is going
on. And it seems to be a very

438
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,230
triggering thing about the fact
that we're really not doing

439
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:27,000
anything for the Gaza people.
And we're maybe not doing it on

440
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,900
purpose just to get these
Iranians worked up. We really do

441
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,260
this is a war that's got to
happen have to happen. And

442
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,310
here's the unreported this story
is unreported in the mainstream

443
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,880
media. And it makes zero sense
unless you're trying to cause

444
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,200
trouble. This was the unreported
story about one of the vetoes

445
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,010
that we did, and you went away.
This was great,

446
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,650
Unknown: while insisting they
were working to get aid into

447
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:57,000
Gaza, those against the United
States standing alone blocked

448
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,060
the Security Council from
passing a resolution that would

449
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,290
do just that. And

450
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,980
Adam Curry: our ambassador to
the United Nations. I forget her

451
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,570
name. She's just sitting back
like, raise my hand. I got a

452
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:13,530
veto here going on. Did you see
that? She wasn't like engaged.

453
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,340
You're just leaning back? Yep,
I'm against and we got a veto.

454
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,670
Unknown: The US Ambassador
insisted that the draft was

455
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,630
incomplete.

456
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,750
The United States is
disappointed this resolution

457
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:29,880
made no mention of Israel's
rights of self defense, like

458
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:33,780
every nation in the world.
Israel has the inherent right of

459
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:38,490
self defense, as reflected in
article 51 of the UN Charter.

460
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,230
The resolution did condemn Hamas
as October 7 attack and the

461
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,250
taking of civilian hostages, as
well as demanding pauses in the

462
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,400
fighting for aid deliveries.
After several days of

463
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,810
negotiations, 12 council members
voted for it. Many pointing out

464
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,320
that civilians, humanitarian
workers and medical facilities

465
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,400
must be protected under
international humanitarian law.

466
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,290
John C Dvorak: You know, she
blocked it, because it's already

467
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,020
in the UN Charter that
everyone's has a right to self

468
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,830
defense. But it had to be
reiterated in this in this

469
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,570
proposal. Are you kidding me? So
for it's it's really it's a

470
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:23,250
technicality. Yes. So she puts a
veto in for that reason, right?

471
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,740
I don't have this clip. But
right afterwards, the British,

472
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,910
the Brazilian guy who put this
forward, he went on and on and

473
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,510
on about how well, you know,
this thing was researched this

474
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:37,260
this proposal. And the fact that
the United States is the United

475
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,700
States stood alone to veto it is
just a triggering mechanism.

476
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,930
Now, I do have the one, which
indicates to me that we're going

477
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,670
to war with Iran if we can,

478
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,969
Adam Curry: yes, we need now
some more. Well, we'll get to

479
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:51,749
that in a minute. Yes,

480
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,240
John C Dvorak: something more
has to happen. But it's

481
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,960
obviously in the cards. And this
brings us back to the west

482
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,310
Clarke seven, and the Trump
memo, where the preparation for

483
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:05,550
the Iranian attack has already
been in play. They did it took

484
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,770
place during the Trump
administration, and he has a

485
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,340
copy of

486
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,080
Adam Curry: it without his
knowledge.

487
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:15,449
John C Dvorak: Yeah, it was.
It's not like that. So the only

488
00:28:15,449 --> 00:28:19,529
thing that's the kind of a
kicker is not much of a backup

489
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:22,679
of this, but the Russians caught
wind of what we're up to. And so

490
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:26,369
they tried, they're trying to
pull a kind of a fast one is the

491
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:31,979
way we do it. And this is the
unreported USA veto. A do this

492
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:32,909
clip, too.

493
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,520
Unknown: Many members of the
Security Council vowed to keep

494
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,810
working towards consensus and a
resolution. But Russia taking a

495
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:43,050
page from the west playbook
suggested they bring the issue

496
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:47,100
to the General Assembly instead
for a vote where no country has

497
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,000
veto power.

498
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:53,340
Adam Curry: All right. All
right. Cute. Way to go. Well,

499
00:28:53,400 --> 00:29:01,980
I'm so not to move back a little
bit. Before the bumbling Biden

500
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,720
showed up the other team, which
the other team is very annoying,

501
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,360
I could probably obsess over
that choice of descriptor for a

502
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,380
long time. You know, what is it
red team? The blue team, you

503
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,560
know, what does that even mean?
Why'd you use that? What's wrong

504
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,470
with you? You Oh, man, this is
not sorry to be ageist. But

505
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:27,210
that's nuts. But last week on 60
minutes, our president was much

506
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,070
more coherent. They got him
jacked up. Maybe it was the

507
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,910
other guy, I don't know. But he
had a message for Iran last

508
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,300
week.

509
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:37,170
Unknown: Rarely does a president
confront so much peril, the

510
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:41,340
catastrophe in Israel, the war
in Ukraine and no help from a

511
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:46,050
paralyzed Congress. Mr. Biden
will be at one next month and he

512
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,860
has said just that when he's
tired, his lifelong stutter can

513
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:55,230
creep back in there about people
that gotcha President 2 million

514
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,710
people trapped about half of
them are children. Are you

515
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:03,480
asking Israel to To establish a
humanitarian corridor in that

516
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,600
area or get humanitarian
supplies, yes, our

517
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,050
team is talking to them about
that. And whether there can be a

518
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:14,190
safe zone. We're also talking
with the Egyptians, whether

519
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:21,540
there is an outlet to get these
children and and women out into

520
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:26,070
out of the hat area at this
moment that

521
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,990
you would like to see a
humanitarian corridor that

522
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:35,610
allows some of the 2 million
Gazans out of the area. Yes, you

523
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:40,230
would like to see humanitarian
supplies brought into Gaza? Yes.

524
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:45,420
So you do not agree with the
Israeli total siege of the Gaza

525
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:45,840
Strip.

526
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,190
I'm confident that Israel is
going to act under the major the

527
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:54,150
rules of war. There's a
standards that democratic

528
00:30:54,150 --> 00:31:00,600
institutions and countries go
by. And so I'm, I'm confident

529
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,800
that there's going to be an
ability for the innocents in

530
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:10,050
Gaza to be able to have access
to medicine and food and water.

531
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:14,520
There's limited fighting already
on the northern Israeli border.

532
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,720
And I wonder what is your
message to Hezbollah, and its

533
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,830
backer Iran.

534
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,870
Adam Curry: Set up?

535
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,690
Unknown: Don't Don't Don't
Don't,

536
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,240
don't come across the border
don't escalate this war.

537
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:30,239
Adam Curry: All right. So when
you say don't that means Come

538
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:34,169
on, do it, do it. We want to go
we need that. We need it to

539
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:39,929
start. Come on, do it by saying
don't. And then the most

540
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:45,539
remarkable, most remarkable
statement from the President and

541
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:49,019
you say he's not that jacked up.
This is jacked up for this Joe

542
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:53,939
right now. I mean, the guy was
dead brain dead in Israel.

543
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,660
John C Dvorak: I have three
clips. I want to play Wait, let

544
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,380
me play this. No, not now. I
want to play the Biden in Israel

545
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,700
clips when we get the chance.

546
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,870
Unknown: Wow, yeah, we'll get
there are the wars in Israel and

547
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,360
Ukraine more than the United
States can

548
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:17,490
take on at the same time the
United States of America got the

549
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:20,100
most powerful nation in the
history of the world and the

550
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,450
history of the world?

551
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:24,269
Adam Curry: Oh, the history of
the world. Oh, part of these

552
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:29,490
Unknown: wars in Israel and
Ukraine relate to the safety of

553
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,570
the American people.

554
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,230
Overwhelmingly, they relate. For
example, in Ukraine, one of my

555
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:39,540
objectives was to prevent Putin
who has committed war crimes

556
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:45,600
himself, who, from being able to
occupy an independent country

557
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:50,430
that borders NATO allies, and is
on the Russian border. Imagine

558
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:54,030
what happens now, if he were
able to succeed. Have you ever

559
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:57,450
known a major war in Europe we
didn't get sucked into. We don't

560
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:01,500
want that to happen. We want to
make sure those democracies are

561
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,240
sustained. And Ukraine is
critical. And making sure that

562
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,930
happens.

563
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:12,990
Why do you feel so strongly?
What does Israel mean to you?

564
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,790
Adam Curry: It's almost like,
like you're asking a seven year

565
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:21,450
old What does Israel mean to
you? To me? Totally

566
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:25,979
Unknown: Jews have been
subjected to abuse, prejudice

567
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:34,169
and attempt to wipe them out for
over 1000 years. For me, it's

568
00:33:34,169 --> 00:33:39,809
about decency, respect, honor,
dignity. It's just simply wrong.

569
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:43,859
Wrong, wrong. Wrong. It violates
every religious principle I have

570
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:47,399
in every way and every single
principle My father taught me.

571
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:51,270
Adam Curry: Yeah, bringing the
old dead. It's, this is what's

572
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,720
so interesting. We have a
situation now where we are

573
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:00,630
funding Nazis in Ukraine, and
we're caught. I mean, seriously,

574
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,200
yeah, that's it, you know, it's
like, it's the dichotomy is

575
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:10,680
crazy the way but what we're
seeing, and this is important in

576
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,880
light of him being at one
etcetera, and generally the

577
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:18,900
octogenarians in in our
government, and many older

578
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:23,730
people around the world. This is
generational. And I think Israel

579
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:27,900
has lost the moral war. I mean,
this is what you're seeing that

580
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,560
I'm not saying it's right or
wrong. But and this probably

581
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,040
comes back to the loneliness op
that we identified. Hey, man, I

582
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,980
got something like that. There's
more victims. I can go out on

583
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,680
the street and I can protest.
It's like Black Lives Matter all

584
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,250
over again. We go pro Palestine
because Screw you, Israel. This

585
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:48,390
is this is a problem that I
think the Biden administration

586
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:52,860
and probably all governments are
not identifying properly. Your

587
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:57,030
people do not agree with this
anymore. The vocal people, the

588
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,210
people that you sent out for
George Floyd it.

589
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,030
John C Dvorak: Yep. All over the
world. People all over it

590
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,810
exactly

591
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,170
Adam Curry: the same people.
Exactly the same people. Now on

592
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:13,560
top of that, I'm sorry. We do
not have the fighting force. I

593
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,440
don't even think you know, wo
IDF. They're the best effort.

594
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,790
No, I don't think so. They're
not used to this. What Hamas and

595
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,450
Hezbollah would they have they
have been training in real war

596
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:29,640
real they fearless killing for a
long time. We don't have

597
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:34,260
manpower. We don't we're AI come
on all of a sudden we have we

598
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,320
have ammunition. We didn't have
it for Ukraine. We don't have

599
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:44,280
it. The Israel wanted 3000 Iron
Dome 50k a pop rockets. Now we

600
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,530
got 300 We're out of ammo. We
don't have enough people. You

601
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,410
know, we may look badass. I
think you know, we got a couple

602
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:56,610
1000 people in Syria looks
great. But we really don't have

603
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,710
I don't think we don't have the
weaponry in place. And the

604
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:07,560
training in guerrilla warfare or
the urban warfare. I'm just not

605
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,520
so sure, Mr. President, that
we're irrational? I don't think

606
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,080
so. And I really doubt the
Israelis. capacity at this

607
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:23,040
point. I'm not so sure that we
can win anything. Yeah.

608
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,510
John C Dvorak: I think it's a
valid position.

609
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,640
Adam Curry: Yeah. What are you
going to do? Is Israel going to

610
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,540
drop a nuke? Well, that does not
going to work. You blow yourself

611
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,330
up. There's going to be no
nukes, I'll tell you that right

612
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,610
now. No nukes are going to
happen. So you can stop worrying

613
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:43,500
about that. But we need it then
the play is simple. We need

614
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,090
Hezbollah, Hezbollah to attack
in the north, then we can go

615
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:51,240
straight after Iran. And it'll
be interesting to see what we

616
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:51,600
do.

617
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,240
John C Dvorak: We some is going
to happen, at least from the

618
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,670
looks of things. I have liquid
Democracy Now clip, although I

619
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,140
prefer nothing, you know, and

620
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,810
Adam Curry: we don't want
anything happening. Of course,

621
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:12,690
we're anti war. This is
Professor Rashid Khalidi on

622
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,620
Democracy Now

623
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,410
Unknown: spawned to President
Biden sitting down with the

624
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:20,310
Prime Minister Netanyahu today
and saying the other team did it

625
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,040
attacking the hospital and go on
from there.

626
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,430
The President has bonded the
United States, Israel, the hip

627
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,420
since very soon after this
horrible escalation started. In

628
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,530
so doing, he's made the United
States responsible in the eyes

629
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:37,440
of the world for everything. And
this is the latest example of

630
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,220
that. He's basically read from
an Israeli teleprompter, as he

631
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,730
seems to do routinely, when
anything relating to the Middle

632
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,120
East comes up. It's almost as if
his lines are scripted in Tel

633
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,210
Aviv at the Israeli Defense
Ministry, where their

634
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,240
disinformation headquarters are
located.

635
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,490
Adam Curry: I should probably
add one more thing to this just

636
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:59,640
so people understand the
dynamics of Israel in the United

637
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:05,910
States, AIPAC. A AIPAC is what
is it the American Israeli?

638
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,150
Something? AIPAC is very
important and all

639
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,610
John C Dvorak: it's a big gun.
They have a big convention.

640
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,960
Adam Curry: And the convention
for Republicans specifically is

641
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,380
very

642
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,590
John C Dvorak: pretty No, it's
across the board who met Schumer

643
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,940
is always there speaking.

644
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:27,270
Adam Curry: So here's how it
works. AIPAC, very well funded

645
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:32,070
by Israel, Israel, that American
Jews or whatever people might

646
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:36,810
say is by Israel. And if you are
not all in with what a PACs

647
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,790
agenda is, they will primary
you. That's the threat. And

648
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,570
money drives all politics all
around the world, and certainly

649
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:50,310
in the United States. So, you
know, Biden has to do what the

650
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:54,840
AIPAC agenda is all politicians
have to do with it particularly,

651
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,530
it could not be a better time in
an election year coming up. You

652
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:02,160
better do it, otherwise you will
lose power. And that's what

653
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,610
they're all afraid of. They
don't really care about Israelis

654
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:11,550
or Palestinians or Americans or
Iranians. They're insane. All of

655
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:15,900
them. We've We've let a whole
politicians go insane and busy

656
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,010
work. And if they're not it only
take one year, one year in DC

657
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:21,180
and you're part of the gang

658
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,590
John C Dvorak: get more from
that guy. I had that clip.

659
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,430
Adam Curry: I do. I do. About
not that guy. I have. I think

660
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:38,130
actually this we've had NBC I
want to play a few CBS CIA

661
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:44,010
broadcasting systems. I have
three small trifecta. Regarding

662
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,710
this, this latest frack is
joining us

663
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,570
Unknown: at the table is
Margaret Brennan. She's chief

664
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,330
foreign affairs correspondent
and moderator of face nation.

665
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,580
Margaret really glad to have you
here today

666
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,980
Adam Curry: because she's an
expert at reading prompter.

667
00:39:56,759 --> 00:39:59,549
John C Dvorak: So much to unpack
why she Yes, exactly

668
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,080
Adam Curry: what she's done.
expert because this is the

669
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,660
morning show. It's the morning
show. All right, let's get

670
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,790
really deep into it with
Margaret Brennan who read let's

671
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:09,030
talk journalists talking to
journalists. Yes. That's when

672
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,740
the messaging is always
considered

673
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,230
John C Dvorak: a faux pa in
journalism technically

674
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,430
considered a faux pas.

675
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,700
Adam Curry: Yes. You think this
is journalism? Margaret, really?

676
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,520
John C Dvorak: In this case?
Yes. That even that is the

677
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,740
newsreader talking to
newsreader. Yes, I'm

678
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,660
Adam Curry: going to introduce
you with the script. And you can

679
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,850
read the script. Go ahead.
Hello, Margaret. I'm so happy

680
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,970
you're here. You are the expert
here today. Yes. Glad to be here

681
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:30,540
to unpack

682
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,680
Unknown: on this. The blame game
is underway. Who was responsible

683
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,540
for the bombing of the hospital?
Oh, very

684
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,170
John C Dvorak: good. Get it got
me interrupting mode. Yes. Okay.

685
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:44,820
When an unpacked becomes such a
universal phrase. Have you

686
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,370
noticed that? It shows up all
the time? I was hearing it this

687
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:50,460
morning. Yeah. unpack what
you're on packet. I think we can

688
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,240
pack I think we

689
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,670
Adam Curry: should say unzip it.
You know, that would be much

690
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:57,810
cooler. We will use unzip it.
Unzip that archive for me. Do

691
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,430
you have winds are

692
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:03,179
Unknown: to hopefully bring
sides together? What challenges?

693
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:06,659
What additional problems? Does
this cause for the President of

694
00:41:06,659 --> 00:41:07,859
the United States at this time?

695
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,600
Adam Curry: Oh, let's go
straight to politics.

696
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,330
Unknown: Whatever the facts are,
it's the perception that matters

697
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,940
and the perception in the
streets of Jordan in Egypt, I am

698
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,420
a journalist, facts don't
matter. West Bank, United States

699
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,890
saying it stands by his wife.

700
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:22,739
Adam Curry: She literally said
that look, but who cares? Who

701
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:25,319
cares? What facts are let's
listen to let's unpack that

702
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:25,709
again.

703
00:41:25,799 --> 00:41:28,859
Unknown: This time, whatever the
facts are. It's the perception

704
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:31,169
that matters. And the perception
in the streets of Jordan and

705
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:33,899
Egypt in the West Bank is that
the United States saying it

706
00:41:33,899 --> 00:41:37,229
stands by Israel without
question means that it is

707
00:41:37,439 --> 00:41:41,459
allowing for continued civilian
casualties, not just with that

708
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:44,909
hospital bombing, but it is seen
in the broader context of this

709
00:41:44,909 --> 00:41:48,089
bombardment. They talk about
bombing bombing that's been

710
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:52,289
going on for 11 days now. And
certainly it became politically

711
00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:55,469
untenable for the King of
Jordan, to host the president,

712
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:57,689
the United States. And that's
pretty extraordinary. Given

713
00:41:57,959 --> 00:42:00,749
Israel and Jordan and Egypt,
they have peace treaties. This

714
00:42:00,749 --> 00:42:04,409
is one of our closest allies in
the Middle East. And because of

715
00:42:04,409 --> 00:42:07,619
the uproar in the streets, it
just became impossible to host

716
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:11,159
the president. So that shows the
level of complexity that this

717
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:15,509
mistake perhaps was an errant
strike. Was it on whose part

718
00:42:15,509 --> 00:42:20,249
exactly somebody military claims
it was Islamic Jihad, a militant

719
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:23,369
group that's smaller than Hamas,
but operative there?

720
00:42:23,399 --> 00:42:26,909
Adam Curry: This is this Hello,
new player, new player, the

721
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:31,199
Palestinian Islamic Jihad new
player is being introduced by

722
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:33,059
CBS, which is not just No,

723
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:36,120
John C Dvorak: everybody's been
talking about that group. None.

724
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,260
Yes. I have the clip that I
played earlier, from NBC.

725
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,840
Unknown: But this is not present
this morning when he said the

726
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:45,960
other team is responsible. He
didn't say what that was based

727
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,650
on. Is that a US intelligence
assessment? Is that accepting

728
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,350
the Israeli military's version
of I love

729
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,930
Adam Curry: the guy in the
background? Oh, cool, cool.

730
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:55,350
whole

731
00:42:55,379 --> 00:42:58,079
Unknown: team is responsible. He
didn't say what that was based

732
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,739
on. Is that a US intelligence
assessment? Is that accepting

733
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:05,399
the Israeli military's version
of events? And so could that

734
00:43:05,399 --> 00:43:09,089
escalate things? Yes,
absolutely. And that is part of

735
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:14,249
the concern here is how do you
win back? The public? Holly's

736
00:43:14,249 --> 00:43:16,199
piece was just showing her the
political problems that the

737
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:20,129
Prime Minister of Israel has his
people want retribution for this

738
00:43:20,129 --> 00:43:24,269
horrific attack that happened.
But as you're seeing with the

739
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,009
president there with the
Secretary of State with the

740
00:43:26,009 --> 00:43:29,249
Secretary of Defense, with all
these lawmakers going, there are

741
00:43:29,279 --> 00:43:32,399
quiet questions being asked
behind closed doors to the

742
00:43:32,399 --> 00:43:35,999
Israeli government saying Prime
Minister Netanyahu, what is your

743
00:43:35,999 --> 00:43:37,799
plan for what comes next?

744
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,680
Adam Curry: Ah, okay. So CBS
knows that there's quiet

745
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,440
conversations and questions
going on in the background

746
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,210
behind closed doors. Do you
think it

747
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,580
Unknown: was necessary for
President Biden to be there at

748
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:52,560
this particular time? Well, I, I
was, you know, talking with

749
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,980
officials last night saying, Can
you call it off yet the planes

750
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:00,780
and road they were stuck. It had
already been announced, even

751
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,260
after the Arab summit was called
off because President Abbas had

752
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,990
to return to the West Bank,
there are protests against him.

753
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:10,500
And then in Jordan and Egypt,
you see these protests going to

754
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,600
Israel, for some will look like
the United States is standing by

755
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:20,010
even if this is an open question
of vulnerabilities, very

756
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:22,110
Adam Curry: serious problems
that were to be discussed at the

757
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:24,570
Arab summit involving
humanitarian aid and access to

758
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,850
each of those remain. Are they
being discussed on the

759
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,980
sidelines, any progress that can
be made?

760
00:44:29,009 --> 00:44:31,979
Unknown: Well, the President
will be calling some of those

761
00:44:31,979 --> 00:44:35,459
leaders as well. He can't be
seen standing beside them

762
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,189
because of their own political
issues. But you know, Secretary

763
00:44:38,189 --> 00:44:40,829
Blinken spent the better part of
the last week shoveling around

764
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:44,609
the Middle East and came back to
Israel to pres Prime Minister

765
00:44:44,609 --> 00:44:47,969
Netanyahu to get this agreement
to allow in any aid even though

766
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:50,849
it's very restricted, what is
being allowed in VA that we

767
00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:55,949
vetoed, if any, is allowed. And
for some, it appears that this

768
00:44:55,949 --> 00:44:58,979
visit was collateral for that,
because Tony Blinken and the

769
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:02,369
Secretary of State was by Behind
closed doors for nine hours,

770
00:45:02,549 --> 00:45:05,099
with the Israeli government
trying to get this agreement to

771
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:06,299
allow in aid, but

772
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,220
Adam Curry: obviously we're the
most powerful country in the

773
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,880
world. We're the best. We
control everything except to Oh,

774
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,040
crap. We didn't control that
part. last clip.

775
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:16,080
Unknown: What if anything, can
you tell us about diplomatic

776
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,710
efforts to release the hostages,
we saw the mother with a picture

777
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:22,320
of her daughter who has now
become the face of the hostages,

778
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,890
he or Gail, I've been talking to
sources in the Middle East here

779
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,860
in the United States, people who
work with hostage families,

780
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:34,650
there had been some hope leading
up to this bombing. And this

781
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,920
morning I am told Hamas is
signaling that it is not

782
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:41,610
possible for them at this moment
to go through with any kind of

783
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:44,250
release. Now that's if you
believe that the diplomatic

784
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:47,400
efforts to date actually we're
going to be successful was

785
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,610
Adam Curry: this laugh for Moshe
was was just so funny, was so

786
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:51,510
fun to go through.

787
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,610
John C Dvorak: Where was that?
Where was that placed? Again,

788
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:57,390
Unknown: it's possible for them
at this moment to go through

789
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:00,150
with any kind of release. Now,
that's if you believe that the

790
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:03,030
diplomatic efforts to date
actually, we're going to be

791
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,080
successful. So this

792
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,940
John C Dvorak: diplomatic
efforts she thinks is bullcrap

793
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:13,500
we all we all know who she
talking to her sources? Yes, in

794
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,030
the Middle East is

795
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,990
Unknown: difficult. And it also
Carol's other diplomacy, very

796
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:20,340
complicated, very layered,

797
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:21,360
Adam Curry: very layered,

798
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:22,560
John C Dvorak: layered, very

799
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,930
Adam Curry: layered. Well,
that's why he had to unpack it

800
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:31,140
because it's layered. It's a tar
ball. All right, back to you,

801
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:31,530
Bob.

802
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,010
John C Dvorak: Let's go with a
couple of these protest clips

803
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:39,390
because there's one it might be
good, just world protests on Al

804
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:40,050
Jazeera.

805
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,870
Unknown: There have been
protests taking place around the

806
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:45,300
world in support of the
Palestinian people.

807
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,510
demonstrators gathered outside
the US Embassy in Tokyo in

808
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:52,860
Japan. They were chanting USA,
shame on you. In Tokyo, police

809
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:56,700
fired water cabinet protesters
on the streets of Istanbul 1000s

810
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,880
are gathered in front of the
Israeli consulate. Demonstrators

811
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,210
in India describe what's going
on in Palestine as a genocide.

812
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:06,360
And members of a Muslim
organization gathered in Chennai

813
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,960
and in the Philippines. People
carried Palestinian flags and

814
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,280
candles and protest the Israeli
airstrike on that hospital in

815
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:18,420
Gaza. Well, the bottom below is
that a demonstration in the

816
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,170
southern Philippines they're

817
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,800
John C Dvorak: talking about the
Philippines gas. It's

818
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,300
unbelievable. The guy pretty
good organizational skills

819
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:31,080
better than ours. Anyway,
onwards. Well,

820
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,770
Adam Curry: I mean, it's it's
that you know, this is I think

821
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,980
it's probably a lot of the trans
Maoism that has crept in every

822
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,430
way

823
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,600
John C Dvorak: I 100%.

824
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:49,950
Adam Curry: I get to see if you
say a for your one 100% I get to

825
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,880
say You bet.

826
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,810
John C Dvorak: I never finished
this. I never got to the tea.

827
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,400
Oh, okay. Mobilization

828
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,310
Unknown: gathered in Chennai.
And in the Philippines, people

829
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:02,880
carried Palestinian flags and
lit candles and protest at the

830
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,380
Israeli airstrike on that
hospital in Gaza. Well, Barnaby

831
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,750
Lowe is at a demonstration in
Marawi in the southern

832
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,360
Philippines and joins us live
Barnaby. So what are protesters

833
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,480
telling you? And why are they so
angry about events in Gaza?

834
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:19,440
It's definitely a huge anger
here as demonstrated by the huge

835
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,370
crowd right behind me. And it's
not just here all over Morocco

836
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:27,060
is city. There are banners and
posters saying Free Palestine

837
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:31,800
and Israeli occupation. This
protest, definitely primarily

838
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,780
sparked by that attack on the
hospital in Gaza on Tuesday, but

839
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:41,130
their calls their condemnation
go beyond that. Just just that

840
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:45,030
one incident. And in fact, they
go beyond this week long

841
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:51,000
hostilities in Gaza. atrocities
they say by Israeli forces. They

842
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,300
say they want an end to Israeli
occupation because they

843
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,410
understand that people in Gaza
have been living under constant

844
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:02,310
bombardment. And they have been
living under decades of blockade

845
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:07,470
by by Israel. And so they want a
free Palestine, not just in

846
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,210
Gaza, but also in the West Bank.

847
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:14,370
Adam Curry: All right. I have a
protest clip from ABC. This is

848
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:19,260
about protests across the Middle
East. And they all start off

849
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,190
perfectly fine.

850
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,310
Unknown: In Beirut today, we
witnessed protesters rushing the

851
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:29,940
American embassy security forces
pushing them back using tear

852
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:35,520
gas, water hoses and rubber
bullets. Amid the chaos we take

853
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:41,070
cover. As you can see protesters
pushing back against security

854
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:44,700
forces started by throwing rocks
launching fireworks. It's been a

855
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:48,630
constant push and pull here
between security forces and the

856
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:50,910
protesters who were trying to
push up against the American

857
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:55,140
Embassy. They say they're
outraged at Israel's bombardment

858
00:49:55,170 --> 00:50:00,330
of Palestinian citizens and the
US support for it. Ross the

859
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,300
region fury drops Israeli
government and its ally the

860
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:12,510
United States now at a boiling
point from Iran to Jordan. A

861
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,840
deadly explosion at the hospital
in Gaza further and flaming

862
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:19,890
demonstrations, Israel insisting
it was not responsible. The US

863
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:23,070
saying intelligence backs that
up. But for protesters here,

864
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:30,240
that's evidence. The Israeli us
alliance is toxic. Because it's

865
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,190
supported in the West Bank, the
anger growing in Ramallah ABCs

866
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:38,370
Matt Gutman among the
protesters, downtown Ramallah

867
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:42,990
This is a protest of unity the
rallying in support of the

868
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:48,570
Moscow support Palestinian
fighters. People telling me here

869
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:48,720
that

870
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:55,590
those demonstrations quickly
spreading across the West Bank

871
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:59,730
protesters clashing with Israeli
soldiers as the region smolders.

872
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:03,450
Adam Curry: I mean, it's these
demonstrations are and these

873
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:06,750
people who go they have no
historical context, they really

874
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:12,660
don't. Maybe Muslims have some
built in historical context,

875
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,540
generational context that
they've been given throughout

876
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,800
the years and every everyone's
toxified their children. This

877
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,820
will come to a head one way or
another in the Netherlands. In

878
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:28,770
the Netherlands. The protests
have a slogan Hamas Hamas, the

879
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:33,570
Yoda on a cos which translates
to Hamas Hamas put the Jews on

880
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:37,650
the gas as in gas. I mean, this
is Oh, really? Oh, yeah. In

881
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:42,510
Holland. But okay, it's all
right. But let's bring in some

882
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:45,720
show. Hey, yeah. What are you
gonna do we need a show business

883
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,680
angle. All right. Let's

884
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,680
Unknown: switch gears now to
Alicia Keys, and the posts that

885
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:56,640
sparked a social media backlash.
Alicia was criticized for this

886
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,060
Instagram post asking quote,
what would you do if you weren't

887
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:05,190
afraid of anything? I've had my
eyes on paragliding Oh, many

888
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:09,090
user said the word paragliding
was both triggering sensitive

889
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:12,330
giving there used by Hamas
during the October 7 attack on

890
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:16,170
an Israeli Music Festival. The
massacre claimed nearly 300

891
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:19,560
innocent lives and led to the
capture of several hostages.

892
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:22,650
Some even accused Alisha of
showing sympathy toward the

893
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:26,130
terror organization by wearing
green the same color as the

894
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:30,390
Hamas flag. Someone who came to
Alisha is defense. Her former

895
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:34,320
manager guy Oseary the Israeli
American took to Instagram

896
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,710
saying quote I spoke to Alicia
and she was horrified to learn

897
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:40,440
what the word implied and
immediately took it down

898
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:43,020
Adam Curry: rather this is where
we're at this is where

899
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:45,330
John C Dvorak: the old brother
part of the show

900
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:48,570
Adam Curry: if I was President
right now I would have an

901
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:51,690
executive order shut off the
internet shut up

902
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:53,910
John C Dvorak: shop would have
done it years ago but that's

903
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:54,720
Shut up why

904
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,640
Adam Curry: was shut down social
media right now.

905
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:59,550
John C Dvorak: This was done
protests. Let's do this one. We

906
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:02,400
this one was poorly covered. I
thought by the American

907
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,330
president that a Al Jazeera did
a great job in the protest in

908
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:07,500
DC.

909
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:10,170
Adam Curry: Oh, yeah. This was
interesting. In

910
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:12,990
Unknown: Washington, DC
protesters from anti war group

911
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,930
Jewish Voice for Peace have
staged a sitting inside a

912
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:16,980
congressional building.

913
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:19,680
Adam Curry: This is what I mean
by generational this is exactly

914
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,330
what I mean. The demonstrators
are calling

915
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:23,490
Unknown: for an immediate
ceasefire amid the rising death

916
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:26,430
toll in Gaza. Some protesters
are wearing shirts with a word

917
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:30,150
not in our name. Tactical Hanes
sent us this report from Capitol

918
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:30,420
Hill.

919
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,280
Protesters are taking the pro
Palestinian cause to the US

920
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,820
Capitol here in the cannon House
Office Building. This is where

921
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:42,390
members of Congress and their
staff, many of them have their

922
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:48,240
offices. This happened earlier
in the day. I'd say about five

923
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:53,670
dozen maybe six dozen activists
wearing T shirts say not in our

924
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:58,800
name juice, a ceasefire now came
into cannon chanting, they knew

925
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,730
they would be arrested. Now this
all started at a protest just a

926
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:06,780
few blocks away earlier in the
day. More than 1000 people are

927
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:10,470
really all faiths came out. But
I did talk to one gentleman he

928
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:14,310
said his grant his grandparents
survived the Holocaust helped

929
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,900
build Israel. But now he says
you need to come out because he

930
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:23,430
does not believe the people, the
people of his own religion are

931
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,020
doing to the Palestinians.

932
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:28,620
I see my job as carrying on
their legacy as Jews who

933
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:32,310
fundamentally see their role as
standing up for stateless and

934
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,490
oppressed people all throughout
the world. And I see no better

935
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:38,040
way to do that than fighting for
peace and a ceasefire in Gaza

936
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:38,340
today.

937
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:41,070
Adam Curry: Yeah, this is
amazing what's going on? I mean,

938
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:46,380
even amongst the pro, you know,
the Save Palestine protests. If

939
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,590
you look at if you really look
at some of the pictures, there's

940
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:53,040
a lot of Jewish groups they're
Jews for Palestine, they got

941
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:58,110
signs they're intermingled. The
generational fact is that the

942
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:01,140
young people who have have no
context at

943
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,060
John C Dvorak: all they are no
because they weren't given a

944
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,730
decent education for starters,
and they but they

945
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:10,290
Adam Curry: also that people
don't want war anymore. The

946
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:10,770
people don't

947
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,620
John C Dvorak: just this if this
war cranks up the way they're

948
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:17,340
trying to do it with Iran, I
think the backlash is going to

949
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:20,610
be huge, unexpected, because if
you're a Democrat strategist,

950
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:23,040
you're thinking, what are we
going to do to keep Biden in

951
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,040
office because he's going to run
whether you like it or not. Well

952
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,860
make him a war president or
nobody ever votes a war

953
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:32,670
president out of office. George
W. Bush is a good example.

954
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,970
Adam Curry: You know, this. I
hate to say this, now would be a

955
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:41,700
perfect time for Biden to die.
That's, that's the only thing

956
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:47,610
left that would make this chaos
complete. Well, President

957
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:48,240
Kamala,

958
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,890
John C Dvorak: President Camela
Well, things aren't bad enough.

959
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:59,100
Why not? Part two, part two of
this clip is got an interesting

960
00:55:59,100 --> 00:55:59,550
kicker.

961
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,460
Unknown: As we take one more
look is the crowd as they start

962
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:06,240
to get arrested one by one being
put in zip ties, this is going

963
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,090
to be a misdemeanor, they're
unlikely to face any sort of

964
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:12,540
jail time, they'll probably pay
a fine. Just to give you a sense

965
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:15,720
of how different this sentiment
is from those of the elected

966
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:20,760
officials in these buildings.
There was a resolution by one

967
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,420
representative tasking Joe
Biden, the US president to call

968
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:30,120
for a ceasefire in Gaza, in all
13 members of Congress agreed.

969
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,150
Al Jazeera at the US Capitol.

970
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:38,910
John C Dvorak: So call for a
ceasefire in Gaza, which would

971
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:42,450
be not a bad idea. Seems to me.

972
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,800
Adam Curry: I'm pretty I'm
pretty sure that Hamas in total

973
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,710
John C Dvorak: congressmen and
senators be agreed to this is

974
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:52,110
um, this is no, they're not
connected.

975
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:57,720
Adam Curry: There was a Hamas at
some point, I had the clips in

976
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:01,980
here somewhere, said, you know,
we'll let all the hostages go if

977
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,570
he just stopped firing rockets.

978
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:06,930
John C Dvorak: Yeah, I don't
believe that to be true. I

979
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:08,970
Adam Curry: don't believe it
either. But it was a talking

980
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:13,800
point for a moment there. I have
some some trigger clips. People

981
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:22,140
just do using triggering
triggering stuff. Sky News. This

982
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:26,640
is Sky News with former Israeli
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.

983
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,860
And he goes straight for the
jugular.

984
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:32,430
Unknown: And what about those
Palestinians in hospital who are

985
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:34,830
on life support and babies and
incubators?

986
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,070
Adam Curry: Oh, hold on Sky
News. We've got babies and

987
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:40,110
incubators, turn them up, throw
them out

988
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:42,510
Unknown: whose life support an
incubator will have to be turned

989
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:46,170
off because these readings have
cut the power to Gaza?

990
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:51,330
Are you seriously keep on asking
me about Palestinian civilians?

991
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:55,170
What's What's wrong with you?
Have you not seen what happened?

992
00:57:55,290 --> 00:58:00,210
We're fighting Nazis. We don't
target them. So the world can

993
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,120
come and bring them anything
they want. If you want to bring

994
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,930
them electricity, I'm not going
to feed electricity or water to

995
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,170
my enemies. If anyone else wants
that's fine. We're not

996
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:11,820
responsible for this is the
point of

997
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,820
Adam Curry: this is my show. And
I am asking questions your way.

998
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,580
So this is this goes on for
quite a while. But you know,

999
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:33,330
everything's everything's Nazi
now. Nazi Nazi Nazi. Let's go to

1000
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:41,430
Piers Morgan. Piers Morgan, is
who's this guy by Sam Yousef. I

1001
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:44,130
don't know if he mentions it.
But this is, you know, the

1002
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:49,710
dichotomy between Russia,
Ukraine, ISRAEL PALESTINE,

1003
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:52,380
Unknown: I would say I really
applaud Israel for doing one

1004
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:56,610
thing that no military force in
the word does, because I heard I

1005
00:58:56,610 --> 00:59:00,090
heard Ben Shapiro and I heard
Ron DeSantis. And they said,

1006
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,350
they said isn't amazing

1007
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:05,640
Adam Curry: that Ben Shapiro is
now on the world stage. With Ron

1008
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,540
DeSantis.

1009
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,960
John C Dvorak: It doesn't
surprise me he's a hard worker.

1010
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:14,610
He doesn't surprise me at all.

1011
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:18,240
Unknown: Force in the word does,
because I heard I heard Ben

1012
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,690
Shapiro and I heard Ron
DeSantis. And they said, they

1013
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:25,830
said Israel is the only military
force in the world that wore

1014
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:30,330
civilians before bombing them. I
mean, how fucking cute. That is

1015
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:33,870
so nice to have them. Because
with this logic, if Russian

1016
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:36,630
troops started warning
Ukrainians before bombing their

1017
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:40,380
houses, were cool with Putin,
right? I mean, okay, habibi. You

1018
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:45,030
have warned them go invade, it's
fine. You have done your job. I

1019
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:47,820
mean, the thing is, and I
understand all and also heard

1020
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:52,320
Ben Shapiro talking about, about
human shields. So you remember

1021
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,250
my wife's family? They live in
Gaza. So I asked him, I told him

1022
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:01,110
when Israel give you the nice
warning, the cute warning Does

1023
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:04,710
Hamas force you to stay in your
home so you can be bombed and

1024
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:08,670
use a as as human shields? Does
that mean that every single one

1025
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,810
of those civilians will stand in
a obscuring a military target

1026
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:14,970
behind them? Because that's a
lot of weapons. I mean,

1027
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:16,170
harnesses packing? No, it

1028
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:16,890
also doesn't.

1029
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:20,010
Adam Curry: I love these
comparisons.

1030
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,130
Unknown: I want to understand
what is the logic of Israel,

1031
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:25,740
carpet bombing Gaza? I mean, if
there is a logic, if it is a

1032
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:29,160
good if this will make Israel
safe, I want to hear the logic.

1033
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:32,490
So if I can understand this
correctly, basically Israel is

1034
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:35,880
doing this to pressure the
Palestinian community in Gaza,

1035
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,730
to turn against Hamas. Is that
right? I'm sure that's part of

1036
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:41,460
it. Yes, that's smarter. So this
is exactly what terrorist

1037
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:44,730
organization do because there's
organizations would have no

1038
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:48,240
chance beating the whole nation
in battle. So they terrorize and

1039
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,540
they kill the civilians in order
to spread fear and terror so

1040
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,460
they can turn against the
government to change their

1041
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:58,560
policy or to resign, you have
just compared Israel with ISIS.

1042
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:01,560
The thing is, this is the
problem. Israel always

1043
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,770
victimizes itself. And I have
never seen a victim putting

1044
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:08,550
their oppressor under siege and
bombed and 24/7 Israel wants you

1045
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:12,030
to believe that they are the
victim is beginning with Israel

1046
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,340
is so difficult. It's like being
in a relationship with a

1047
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,580
narcissistic psychopath. He
fucks you up and then he makes

1048
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,480
you think it's your fault.

1049
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:23,580
John C Dvorak: Guys got
opinions. By the way, our

1050
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,150
bombing firebombing of the
German cities, especially

1051
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,730
Dresden was exactly this course.

1052
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,730
Adam Curry: This, this is the
context that people don't have.

1053
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:36,690
This has been going on forever,
all around the world all the

1054
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:40,740
time. And we're being told this.
Now it's this is it. This is

1055
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:43,380
where an End Times It's all over
now.

1056
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:46,350
John C Dvorak: It's like the
hottest day. Yeah. The hottest

1057
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:49,530
day, what a good day for 100
years. Because red hot, hot for

1058
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:52,290
100 years. It's good. It must
have been global warming 100

1059
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:53,700
years ago, what are you telling
me? So we've

1060
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,340
Adam Curry: got to shore it all
up now and make sure everybody

1061
01:01:56,340 --> 01:02:00,240
understands particular financial
markets? Let's say it's okay.

1062
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:04,860
Don't worry. We got it under
control. We can do this with the

1063
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:08,130
best country in the world. Have
you ever have the history? Let's

1064
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:13,080
bring out Janet Yellen. She is
after all, in charge of our

1065
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:17,340
finances paid Janet, can we
really clean? Really? Can we

1066
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:21,720
really do all this? I mean, we
do we have mass you? Do we have?

1067
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:24,780
Do we have a war fund? Do we
have like a little piggy bank

1068
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:28,710
are something that we can break
to open up for money? Do we have

1069
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:31,890
that? Is there is there that I
know of? I don't think so either

1070
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:32,130
Paul

1071
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:34,800
Unknown: Tudor Jones, the famed
investor was on CNBC this week.

1072
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,320
And he said, This is the most
threatening and challenging

1073
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,470
geopolitical environment that
I've ever seen. At the same

1074
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:43,980
time, the US is in its weakest
fiscal position since World War

1075
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:50,550
Two, with debt to GDP at 122%.
Can America can the West afford

1076
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,870
another war at this time?

1077
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:54,750
I think the answer is
absolutely.

1078
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:03,060
Adam Curry: Absolutely. Bring in
another one. Hey, how about

1079
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:03,900
Taiwan?

1080
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:07,740
Unknown: Can America can the
West afford another war at this

1081
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:08,040
time?

1082
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:12,660
I think the answer is
absolutely. America can

1083
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:18,090
certainly afford to stand with
Israel and to support Israel's

1084
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:24,600
military needs. And we also can
and must support Ukraine in its

1085
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:30,090
struggle against Russia. The
American economy is doing

1086
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,350
extremely well.

1087
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:34,110
Adam Curry: I love this. It's
doing extremely well.

1088
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:39,120
Unknown: Inflation has been high
and it's been a concern to

1089
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,020
households.

1090
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,990
Adam Curry: It's a concern to
households. It's just a little

1091
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:43,770
concern. What's

1092
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:47,430
Unknown: your problem come down
considerably. Oh, at the same

1093
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:49,530
time, we may rise

1094
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:52,590
John C Dvorak: has come down. It
hasn't reversed.

1095
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:55,890
Adam Curry: It has come down
considerably. Look, I mean,

1096
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:58,470
John C Dvorak: you're still
going up. It's cumulative. This

1097
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:00,420
is the one thing that people
don't understand about

1098
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:06,000
inflation. Please. Explain.
Well, if you have an inflation

1099
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:12,330
rate of 10%, and then it drops
to 5%. It's five on top of the

1100
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:16,470
10. It's not but you can say but
a politician was there? Well, we

1101
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:20,610
had it it's gone down 50%
Inflation has gone down 50%.

1102
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:27,660
It's gone down from 10% to 5%,
which means it was 10%, which

1103
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,990
you've lost, you've already lost
10% of all your all your value

1104
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:34,050
right there. And then it's
another 5% On top of that, on

1105
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:35,490
top of that, on top of that,
it's

1106
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:36,990
Adam Curry: just a concern. It's
a

1107
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:37,890
John C Dvorak: scam.

1108
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:40,980
Adam Curry: It's just it's just
a concern. It's what people are

1109
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,980
talking about around the kitchen
table. It's just a slice

1110
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:47,250
Unknown: of the price of
gasoline. The American economy

1111
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:52,830
is doing extremely well.
Inflation has been high and it's

1112
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:58,290
been a concern to have sold.
It's come down considerably. At

1113
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:03,120
the same time. We As about the
strongest labor market, we've

1114
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:03,750
seen,

1115
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,050
Adam Curry: let's just re
explain the labor market, the

1116
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:10,770
labor market and unemployment is
determined by those who have

1117
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:13,380
registered and are willing to
work versus those who are

1118

have given up.

1119
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:19,950
John C Dvorak: Give. The people
have given up as a huge number.

years to come. Okay, medium

repaved it, but the reason they

1138
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:18,240
stopped, I mean, it's still not
good to be infrastructure. And

there's all kinds of, you know,

about.

1144
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:36,210
Adam Curry: I expect you

1145
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:38,790
John C Dvorak: to do this. I'm
going to do it now.

1146
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:41,430
Adam Curry: And make sure you
focus it on that dashboard,

1147
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:44,580
which you claim after 25 years
has still not cracked.

1148

Adam Curry: the best the
inflation Reduction Act?

1153
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:04,650
John C Dvorak: Yeah. Which is
also the green New Deal. So

1154
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:05,580
that's bull crap.

1155

manufacturing, we have
manufacturing.

01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:17,310
Adam Curry: Oh, I'm sorry, I
must have missed all the

1158
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:19,230
manufacturing going on. I
haven't seen any

1159
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:21,240

college education have been
lifted out of Republicans really

1165
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:46,380
economic progress in the United
States. So the United States,

1166
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:49,410
Adam Curry: you know what, those
jobs aren't serving other people

1167
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:50,910
in restaurants,

1168
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,110
Unknown: a economy is in a good
place. In terms of the fiscal

1169
01:07:55,110 --> 01:08:01,440
situation, I don't know where
122 comes from the US federal

1170
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:06,270
debt to GDP ratio is about 98%
At this point,

1171
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:10,620
Adam Curry: okay. Do you know
that that's, I've heard anything

1172
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:17,430
but a number under 100% debt to
GDP. She's claiming it's 98%. I

1173
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:20,400
thought it was like 110. I've
heard what the guy said 120.

1174
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,390
I've heard 160. And she said, I
don't know where that number

1175
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:29,160
comes from. It's about 98%. But
she did say federal, probably

1176
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,270
plan some words, got

1177
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:31,920
John C Dvorak: some debts,
weasels, there's something

1178
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,450
Weasley about what she said,
yeah,

1179
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:36,299
Unknown: just the fiscal
situation. I don't know where

1180
01:08:36,299 --> 01:08:43,289
122 comes from the US federal
debt to federal ratio is about a

1181
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:49,229
percent at this point. And the
interest expense, which is a

1182
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:54,449
more relevant statistic still
remains manageable. Now. It is

1183
01:08:54,449 --> 01:08:59,399
true with higher interest rates,
and those higher interest rates

1184
01:08:59,489 --> 01:09:02,489
may persist, although that's not
clear.

1185
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:04,680
Adam Curry: Yeah, it's not
clear. Well, it is clear,

1186
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,920
because they're gonna go higher.
Powell just had his little chat

1187
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:12,330
today. And it was like, okay,
that's not working. We need to

1188
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:15,030
start print. The President has
an announcement tonight.

1189
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:18,779
John C Dvorak: Yeah, no. show
now. Of course.

1190
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:21,090
Adam Curry: I think it will be
the let's print some money

1191
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:24,180
night. Yes, you're

1192
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:26,100
John C Dvorak: gonna have to
jack him up tonight. There's no

1193
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:29,220
doubt about it. He's going to be
pumped. So he'll be screaming

1194
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:30,330
about dignity.

1195
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:32,459
Adam Curry: I don't think they
you know, he's over jacked. I

1196
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:35,759
don't think they can do it
anymore. It's not working.

1197
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,120
John C Dvorak: Well, we're gonna
find out tonight because tonight

1198
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:43,440
tonight if they're going to jack
him with a hotshot, tonight's

1199
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,040
the night.

1200
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:48,990
Adam Curry: Tonight's the night.
We're gonna jack him to Jack

1201
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:54,810
him. Well, this I mean, this
will be the speech of his life.

1202
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,390
What can he possibly say?

1203
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:01,020
John C Dvorak: Well, I have some
fun Oops, I might have a couple

1204
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:01,650
of clips.

1205
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,470
Adam Curry: Do you have him
talking about Golden my hair?

1206
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,550
John C Dvorak: Yes, I have that

1207
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:09,180
Adam Curry: clip because I
looked that up. Let's can do you

1208
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:10,560
mind if we play this one first?

1209
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:13,380
John C Dvorak: Well, I will one
is the kicker.

1210
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:15,330
Adam Curry: Okay. We'll do it in
order whatever you want.

1211
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:18,420
John C Dvorak: Let's just go
first, the rambling about peace

1212
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,990
Unknown: doctors, too to be
light into the world as though

1213
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:23,760
we're about. What are

1214
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:24,510
Adam Curry: we about?

1215
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,780
John C Dvorak: But darkness into
the light? Oh, oh,

1216
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,820
Adam Curry: I thought we were
the Doctors of the World. This

1217
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:32,430
into the light into the world
darkness into the light of the

1218
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:33,750
world, the darkness

1219
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:36,900
Unknown: to be light into the
world as it were about,

1220
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:39,300
Adam Curry: oh, we are the
light, the shining light on the

1221
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,770
hill. You inspire

1222
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:45,270
Unknown: hope and light for so
many around the world. That's

1223
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:46,890
what the terrorists seek to
destroy.

1224
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,670
John C Dvorak: As he noticed a
protests about all these were

1225
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:51,900
inspiring people.

1226
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,740
Adam Curry: Yes. Well, he's not.
He's correct. We're inspiring

1227
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:59,880
people to protest. It's all
going according to plan.

1228
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:02,160
Unknown: That's what the
terrorists seek to destroy.

1229
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,460
That's what they seek to
destroy. Because they live in

1230
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:11,190
darkness. But not you, not
Israel. Nations of conscious

1231
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:14,400
like the United States and
Israel are not measured solely

1232
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,060
by example, or power. were
measured by the power of our

1233
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:20,490
example. That's why it's hard.

1234
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:25,140
Adam Curry: Oh, wow, who wrote
that one? Chat GPT. We're not

1235
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:28,500
measured by our examples of
power. No, we're measured by our

1236
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,960
powers of example. This is
unconscious,

1237
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,170
Unknown: it United States in
Israel are not measured solely

1238
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:37,620
by the example or power. And
were measured by the power of

1239
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:41,940
our example. And that's why as
hard as it is, must keep

1240
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:46,080
pursuing peace. Must keep
pursuing a path. So that Israel,

1241
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:50,280
the Palestinian people can both
live safely. Is security and

1242
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,600
dignity in peace?

1243
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:56,670
Adam Curry: No, that's never
going to happen. Dignity, isn't

1244
01:11:56,670 --> 01:12:00,330
it? I mean, every single time
remember president, Bill

1245
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:03,990
Clinton? Oh, yeah. Oh, it's
gonna be great to have peace.

1246
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:07,500
He's gonna be peace. And all we
used to see on television back

1247
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:11,250
in the 70s. Was kids with Sling
shots, but they weren't the

1248
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:14,700
sling shots we had really cool.
Well, yeah, the cool ones like

1249
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:17,130
and they were good at it with
the, you know, like the, the

1250
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:22,770
David's sling shots with. And
that's what we were looking at.

1251
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:25,230
And I always thought, why don't
we give them some good

1252
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:28,320
slingshots. How does that really
work? But those things are cool.

1253
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,520
They they and that's all

1254
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:32,070
John C Dvorak: you get a lot of
velocity off of one of those.

1255
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:32,490
Yeah,

1256
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,780
Adam Curry: yeah, that's, it's
as far back as I can remember.

1257
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:40,620
John C Dvorak: Well, I'm older
than you. And I can say the same

1258
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:42,450
exact words for 3d

1259
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:44,010
Unknown: the story of Moses
death.

1260
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,520
Adam Curry: We're gonna go
biblical here for a second.

1261
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:49,980
John C Dvorak: That's it. That's
why I have to set this up, if

1262
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:59,220
you listen carefully. Key
claims, I think, yes, to have

1263
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:03,030
done something that very few
people have ever done. Read the

1264
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:07,890
Torah. Now why a Catholic boy
would read the Torah is beyond

1265
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:11,280
me. But I think that's what he
says in this clip

1266
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:15,240
Unknown: country, the story of
Moses death. Those who observe

1267
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:18,870
the holiday began reading the
Torah, from the very beginning.

1268
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:25,770
A story of creation reminds us
of two things. First, we get

1269
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:30,900
knocked down, we get back up
again. And we begin to new. And

1270
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:34,620
second, when we're faced with
tragedy and loss, we must go

1271
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:37,650
back to the beginning to
remember who we are who we are,

1272
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:41,910
we are all human beings, created
an image of God with dignity,

1273
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,950
humanity, the purpose?

1274
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:46,260
Adam Curry: No, but the Torah is
the Old Testament.

1275
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:52,710
John C Dvorak: Dignity, the
tourism. Dettori is bigger than

1276
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:55,530
the Old Testament is more to
attend just the Old Testament.

1277
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:59,070
Notice was taken from the Torah,
as far as I know, I'm not

1278
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:04,080
Jewish. Right? So let's go to
the clip. You are so anxious,

1279
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,250
Adam Curry: but it's Hold on a
second. It's it's a cup. It's

1280
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:10,920
several. It's like four or five
books from the Old Testament.

1281
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:16,710
And I don't know if it's bigger.
I mean, it may be bigger to the

1282
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:21,630
Jews. Don't believe in the New
Testament that Jesus was not the

1283
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:25,770
savior. He was a prophet, not
the Son of God. Yeah. And they

1284
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:28,650
still kind of stopped at an eye
for an eye, which is how they're

1285
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:32,520
feeling right now. To all these
rays, like we're going to take

1286
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:37,110
we're gonna gouge your eyes
because you gouges our eye and

1287
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:40,230
it would be nice if everybody
had the love and peace of Jesus.

1288
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:46,830
But okay, but that's neither
here nor there. He says that,

1289
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:47,310
yes.

1290
01:14:48,269 --> 01:14:51,569
John C Dvorak: His column if,
let's say the Torah and the Old

1291
01:14:51,569 --> 01:14:55,259
Testament are exactly the same.
Why wouldn't he say as a good

1292
01:14:55,259 --> 01:15:00,539
Catholic boy that the Old
Testament is pandering,

1293
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:04,589
patronizing. Patriots
patronizing the audience. Yeah.

1294
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:08,430
Adam Curry: Well, he's also
lying. The guy lies about

1295
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:12,090
everything. Yeah, he's a liar.
And this one is a whopper.

1296
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:14,490
John C Dvorak: Okay, now this
was a whopper, you're gonna tell

1297
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:18,570
us why it's a big lie. I looked
at it, as you'll will, you will

1298
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:22,650
soon see as a shaggy dog story
the way he tells it. Let's go.

1299
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,220
Unknown: I told the story before
and I'll tell it again. My first

1300
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:29,070
BT was an Israeli Prime Minister
50 years ago as the young

1301
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:32,550
senator sitting across from
golden years or desk in her

1302
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:36,330
office, because she had a guy
named a guy who later became

1303
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:41,070
prime minister sitting next to
me just before the 1973 Yom

1304
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:45,810
Kippur war. As he flipped the
maps up and down, telling me how

1305
01:15:45,810 --> 01:15:49,440
bad things were out to me. They
were all of a sudden she looked

1306
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:53,280
at me, she said, she'd like a
photograph. I looked at her. She

1307
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:57,270
got up from her desk and walked
out into that hallway. I think

1308
01:15:57,270 --> 01:16:01,920
it's marble for walk down the
hallway. Walk down there, a

1309
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,890
bunch of photographers stand in
front of us. We're standing

1310
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:08,310
shoulder to shoulder without her
looking at me. She said to me

1311
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:12,450
knowing I live here. Why do you
look so worried Senator Biden?

1312
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:17,280
And I said worried? Like of
course I'm worried. And she

1313
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,700
looked at me and she didn't look
she said we don't worry,

1314
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:25,350
Senator. We Israelis have a
secret weapon. We have nowhere

1315
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:30,660
else to go. Or today I said all
of Israel the United States is

1316
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:31,740
going anywhere either.

1317
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:41,670
Adam Curry: I didn't expect
that. He's been telling this

1318
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:45,780
story throughout his career and
in this time, it was just before

1319
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:49,860
the Yom Kippur War it's been
during the Six Day War in the

1320
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:55,140
past CNN has a whole article on
this which is old missing one of

1321
01:16:55,140 --> 01:17:03,510
the one of this published from
CNN, this is from 2021. He keeps

1322
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:06,990
telling this story about Golden
my air and like and then she I

1323
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:12,090
want to take a picture. Now none
of this. It's a corn pop story.

1324
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:18,450
Yeah, totally corn, corn pop
story. He's full of it. I don't

1325
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:22,440
think I have the clip. But he
was I tried to run it through

1326
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:28,140
Adobe No way. Could I get it to
work about him. Saying that.

1327
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:34,140
Jews are not zombies. It's okay
to be a Zionist. Did you hear

1328
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:34,560
that?

1329
01:17:35,010 --> 01:17:38,130
John C Dvorak: Yeah, I remember
something about this. I mean, it

1330
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:41,250
is so here fumbling and mumbling
about Zionist. So here's

1331
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:44,340
Adam Curry: the here's the raw
audio. I

1332
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:49,350
Unknown: remember the first time
that I was in Israel with

1333
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:53,100
Adam Curry: that's almost an
inaudible so I run it through

1334
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:53,940
Adobe.

1335
01:17:54,150 --> 01:17:55,740
John C Dvorak: I can't I can
kind of hear it.

1336
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:57,480
Adam Curry: Well listen to what
Adobe does to him.

1337
01:17:57,510 --> 01:18:02,430
Unknown: I remember the first
time that I was in Israel with

1338
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:06,600
the coordinator and she was just
before with a 60 morning

1339
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:13,290
Adam Curry: there he says Six
Day War. Yeah. And he just in

1340
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:16,110
your clip. Did you say Six Day
War? He said no, no.

1341
01:18:16,110 --> 01:18:18,570
John C Dvorak: Yom Kippur war?
Yom Kippur war.

1342
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:22,800
Adam Curry: This is great. He
confused it on the trip. I

1343
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,530
didn't even I didn't even
realize he had confused it on

1344
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:29,070
the trip. Let's do it and she
was telling me how weightless

1345
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:29,640
let's use this

1346
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:34,590
Unknown: was in Israel with me
here she was just before the Six

1347
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:40,620
Day War and she was telling me
how terrible everything was. It

1348
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:44,700
was she can flip the maps up and
down behind her and all of a

1349
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:53,010
sudden she looked at me she said
would you like a photograph she

1350
01:18:53,010 --> 01:18:54,180
just got up and walked out

1351
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:57,420
Adam Curry: outside her I'm so
we got we caught him in the lies

1352
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:00,420
exactly the same story. Yeah,
except and that was before the

1353
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:03,330
sixth day well, I didn't even
realize he had he had he had

1354
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:07,260
Bumble bat on this trip. Let's
go to the Zionist part here

1355
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:11,730
because the security and safety
of Jews right here somewhere

1356
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:20,460
Unknown: that we're in Israel in
terms of the matter is that I

1357
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:21,240
believe that

1358
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:24,900
Adam Curry: I can't hear it

1359
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:28,200
Unknown: terrible. Everything
was great if they were in

1360
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:28,740
Israel,

1361
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:31,920
Adam Curry: we'd have to admit
it. Why can't forget it? Forget

1362
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:35,640
it. It's a I can't listen to it.
It's so bad as funny this is

1363
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,760
that's crazy because when you
had that clip I'm like wow, you

1364
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,820
found a clip of good audio I
couldn't find that story with

1365
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:45,990
good audio which is why I didn't
clip it and now it turns out it

1366
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:49,470
was before the the Yom Kippur
War on your clip before the Six

1367
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:55,500
Day War on my clip Wow, our
president is a liar lost

1368
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,780
John C Dvorak: it he's and he's
a liar. He's a liar.

1369
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:58,830
Unbelievable liar.

1370
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:04,290
Adam Curry: Yeah. Let's listen
to some hate from MSNBC that you

1371
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:09,270
pointed out. NBC is all in on
hating Israel. Why? I don't

1372
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:12,360
know. I don't know why either
other than they are the most

1373
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,430
woke most leftist network.

1374
01:20:15,809 --> 01:20:17,909
John C Dvorak: Yeah, I think so.
Here is Mark

1375
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:19,830
Adam Curry: Lamont Hill, Danny
Ireland. Thank

1376
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:21,840
Unknown: you so much for joining
me on upfront with the former

1377
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,460
Adam Curry: Israeli deputy
foreign minister.

1378
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:25,350
Unknown: My pleasure.

1379
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:29,190
The idea of collective
punishment is one of the things

1380
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:33,720
that we're talking about here.
There are residential buildings

1381
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:36,630
being hit, there are hospitals
being hit. This is a densely

1382
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:40,200
populated area, the idea of
being able to run away or to

1383
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,470
escape or go to a safe area
seems impossible. Also,

1384
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,710
according to your own military
representatives, you've

1385
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:50,250
abandoned the idea of knocking
on roofs that is safe to say

1386
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,790
giving a warning of dropping a
non explosive munition on

1387
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:55,890
buildings before people go so
people aren't getting a warning,

1388
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:58,890
they have nowhere to go
residential building schools and

1389
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:03,720
hospitals are being hit. How is
this not again, an act of

1390
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:06,510
collective punishment? And how
is this not a target of civilian

1391
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:09,090
unless of course you're
regarding everybody in Gaza as

1392
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:09,990
an enemy combatant.

1393
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:13,620
Until you in a practical manner,
what we should do and what we

1394
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:17,910
can do create like in the past
in history, a humanitarian

1395
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:21,270
corridor when there is a
humanitarian corridor and we

1396
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:25,440
have been discussing this with
the United States then we can

1397
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:30,420
guarantee in this corridor that
nobody will get hurt. Now again,

1398
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:34,860
I say there is a way to receive
them all on the other side for

1399
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:39,120
temporary time on site because
what did her master and on the

1400
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,250
other side, we talked about
Rafa, are you saying the other

1401
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:41,760
side that go to

1402
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:45,450
Egypt? Yes, absolutely.
Absolutely. And Egypt will have

1403
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:49,650
to play ball because this is
human life is at stake.

1404
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:54,420
Human life is at stake because
you're cutting off power. You're

1405
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:57,300
shutting down hospitals, you're
bombing residential buildings.

1406
01:21:57,510 --> 01:22:00,480
Right now there is a hospital
that has not does not have

1407
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,840
sufficient power. There is a
hospital where people are

1408
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:09,420
literally going to die and
Israelis Energy Minister Israel

1409
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:12,480
Katz said no electrical switch
will be turned on no hydrant

1410
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,390
will be open no fuel trickle
enter until the Israeli

1411
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:18,540
abductees are returned home

1412
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:24,330
Adam Curry: goes on and on and
on and on want to play the rest

1413
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:27,600
of that it's just it's it's just
yeah, now but of course we need

1414
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,240
to bring it home we need to
bring the fear and the terror

1415
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:30,810
home.

1416
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:36,660
Unknown: ABC tonight a warning
the war between Israel and Hamas

1417
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:39,720
is increasing the chances of
violence in the United States. A

1418
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,600
new intelligence bulletin says
potential targets include

1419
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:46,020
individuals and institutions
Andrew Horowitz This is for you

1420
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:50,040
perceived as symbolic of or tied
to the conflict. There are

1421
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:53,460
stepped up patrols at synagogues
in Los Angeles, more crowd

1422
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:56,970
control in Washington DC and in
New York, the nation's largest

1423
01:22:56,970 --> 01:23:00,270
police force has called in
reinforcements instructing all

1424
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:02,850
officers to prepare to work 12
hour shifts.

1425
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,380
There's a lot of tension that's
taking place right now. And this

1426
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:08,880
can play out on our streets.

1427
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:12,750
The FBI is not aware of any
organized plots, but the fear is

1428
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:16,020
someone acting alone. Like the
man charged in the murder of a

1429
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:19,260
six year old boy near Chicago
and Walla dia Alfa Yun was

1430
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:22,050
buried this week after police
said he was stabbed to death by

1431
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:24,030
his landlord because he was
Muslim.

1432
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:26,310
Adam Curry: Yeah, that makes
sense. That makes sense. I have

1433
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:26,790
that story. I

1434
01:23:26,790 --> 01:23:28,860
John C Dvorak: want to play this
story. Just make one comment.

1435
01:23:30,450 --> 01:23:37,710
This is the this is the odd
riots and maniac war in this

1436
01:23:37,710 --> 01:23:39,150
again, NBC so

1437
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:42,960
Unknown: in Washington, DC
dozens were arrested at the

1438
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,320
Capitol during a rally of Jewish
Americans calling for a

1439
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:51,510
ceasefire. And in suburban
Chicago last night, more than

1440
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:56,520
1500 people packed a vigil for a
Palestinian American boy he was

1441
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:59,880
a child. A child filled with
love. And not any hate

1442
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:03,090
prosecutors saying six year old
one dia alpha you meet was

1443
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:06,750
stabbed dozens of times by his
family's landlord who they say

1444
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:10,260
was angry about the Hamas
attacks. Joseph zuba faces

1445
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:13,920
murder and hate crime charges in
Illinois and has not yet entered

1446
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:19,230
a plea. A child taken and a
country on edge as war wages on

1447
01:24:19,410 --> 01:24:20,310
a world away.

1448
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:22,770
Adam Curry: That's exactly what
you want it I don't believe this

1449
01:24:22,770 --> 01:24:23,460
at all.

1450
01:24:24,030 --> 01:24:27,270
John C Dvorak: Well, I kind of
believe it. And I'll tell you

1451
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:32,010
why. Again, it could be just
part of the hope thesis button.

1452
01:24:32,190 --> 01:24:37,020
So they show a picture the guy
yeah. That guy looks like a

1453
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:43,950
lunatic. He's like I've got a
inexplicably homely looking old

1454
01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:49,860
man. That is just looks like
he's nuts. And I tried them to

1455
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:52,170
kind of believe a lot of it
because it just seemed like you

1456
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:56,640
got some screwball the guy just
looks the guy looks wrong. Okay,

1457
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:56,910
so

1458
01:24:56,910 --> 01:24:59,460
Adam Curry: people are being
riled up and this is the result

1459
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:03,210
of it. Yeah, yeah. Well, this is
this is what you get this is

1460
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:04,320
this is what everybody is

1461
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:06,660
John C Dvorak: to blame the
media as far as I'm concerned.

1462
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:07,950

This is being ramped up to make

01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:19,590

01:30:05,159 --> 01:30:08,699
Middle Eastern media and this is
from Al Jazeera and the way they

Interesting.

1560
01:30:37,889 --> 01:30:39,929
John C Dvorak: That's another
little tidbit they leave out of

1561
01:30:39,929 --> 01:30:44,279
our coverage. That's very
interesting. Yeah. Baptist I

1582
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,950
huge words press didn't save
their lives.

1583
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:52,380
John C Dvorak: Yeah, they're the
newer ones. They shoot me.

1584
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:57,000

He says media.

1585
01:31:57,690 --> 01:32:00,300
John C Dvorak: Yeah, and he's
got a dumb helmet on.

1586
01:32:00,330 --> 01:32:04,380
Adam Curry: Yeah. But it's his
Flak Jacket is huge words media.

1587
01:32:04,710 --> 01:32:08,130
Yeah, I saw that. Do they
seriously think that? I mean, it

1588
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:11,760
used to be Red Cross. Don't
shoot him. Yeah. Now he's media.

1589
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:12,630
He's helpful.

1590
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:14,700
John C Dvorak: He's Elbit us.

1591
01:32:14,730 --> 01:32:18,330
Adam Curry: So Claire Daly Irish
representative in the European

1592
01:32:18,330 --> 01:32:18,810
Union,

1593
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:21,810
John C Dvorak: who we follow
closely with Yes, we this is our

1594
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:24,180
favorite socialist chick. She's
a socialist

1595
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:29,700
Adam Curry: and man. Something
happened this was not a good

1596
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:34,710
look for her. I mean, she looks
Claire Daly usually looks you

1597
01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:37,800
know she's a Birkenstock with
your with her dress type lady

1598
01:32:37,830 --> 01:32:38,700
kind of in general.

1599
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,310
John C Dvorak: She's kind of a
she looks

1600
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:44,610
Adam Curry: Jaggard Chuck
haggard in this she. She

1601
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:46,830
John C Dvorak: I think most of
the time she's pretty haggard.

1602
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:49,470
Adam Curry: No, no, no, no, not
like this one that she had a

1603
01:32:49,470 --> 01:32:52,920
sweatshirt on and I don't know
what happened. But she anyway,

1604
01:32:53,220 --> 01:33:00,210
she was pretty angry. At Queen
Ursula. Queen or slow who went

1605
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:03,870
right away with her Flak Jacket
and you see her whether she must

1606
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:05,430
be three feet tall. This Ursula

1607
01:33:05,639 --> 01:33:08,279
John C Dvorak: she has. She's
she's a little shorty this you

1608
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:09,419
get a little petite

1609
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:12,810
Adam Curry: little a little flak
jacket on that said queen. Don't

1610
01:33:12,810 --> 01:33:18,060
hit don't. Queen. Claire Dana
was pretty angry about this.

1611
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:21,720
Unknown: I've been involved in
politics for 40 years, but I

1612
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:26,550
have never seen anything like
what is being unleashed in Gaza

1613
01:33:26,910 --> 01:33:32,850
in full public view. While the
world watches it unfold 10 days

1614
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:37,440
of relentless airstrikes. One in
1000 people murdered by the

1615
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:42,990
Israeli government in a week,
open declarations of siege 24

1616
01:33:42,990 --> 01:33:47,430
hours of fuel, electricity and
water left collective punishment

1617
01:33:47,430 --> 01:33:52,770
on innocent people, all illegal,
all war crimes. And when the EU

1618
01:33:52,770 --> 01:33:56,280
should have been arguing for a
ceasefire for the upholding of

1619
01:33:56,280 --> 01:34:00,090
international law for the
protection of civilians, Ursula

1620
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:04,920
von der Leyen torches down in
Tel Aviv to photo up the

1621
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:09,690
preparation of a genocide and
says your upstands when Israel

1622
01:34:09,870 --> 01:34:15,330
now and in the days to come, how
dare she she has no authority in

1623
01:34:15,330 --> 01:34:19,380
foreign affairs matter. She does
not speak for me. She does not

1624
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:23,160
speak for Ireland, and she does
not speak for the citizens of

1625
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:27,270
Europe. We stand for peace. We
stand for justice for the people

1626
01:34:27,390 --> 01:34:30,930
of Palestine and for the
upholding of international law.

1627
01:34:30,990 --> 01:34:34,650
It's long past the time that
this woman exited the stage.

1628
01:34:34,650 --> 01:34:36,360
It's time for her to go.

1629
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,600
Adam Curry: It makes a good
point that Ursula von der Leyen

1630
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,810
pretends to be speak for the
year like she's the president,

1631
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:43,860
the queen of Europe.

1632
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:47,400
John C Dvorak: She's not the
only one of Claire's not the

1633
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:50,400
only one who has made this
commentary. They're getting a

1634
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,920
little annoyed with her going
around things. She's like the

1635
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:56,670
foreign secretary of the EU or
whatever she thinks she is the

1636
01:34:56,670 --> 01:35:01,230
Queen Queen, and it's getting
done. on people's nerves.

1637
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:06,720
Adam Curry: Europe is I hate to
say it but Europe is done for

1638
01:35:07,830 --> 01:35:11,550
you're done for Yeah, you're
done for that, of course, you

1639
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:14,790
know, hey Europe while we have
no money at the moment, but that

1640
01:35:14,790 --> 01:35:17,790
may change tonight we'll see
what the President says. You've

1641
01:35:17,790 --> 01:35:21,000
got to remember to keep funding
Ukraine keep funding them keep

1642
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,600
fun. I'm hearing noise that
Ukrainians are pretty sick and

1643
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:28,530
tired of Zelinsky now they were
supposed to have an election

1644
01:35:28,530 --> 01:35:29,370
which is obviously

1645
01:35:29,370 --> 01:35:31,860
John C Dvorak: not canceled
elections so you'd be king

1646
01:35:31,889 --> 01:35:37,349
Adam Curry: any a also just
outlawed the Christian Orthodox

1647
01:35:37,349 --> 01:35:37,739
Church,

1648
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:41,640
John C Dvorak: right, the
opposition parties. A democracy

1649
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:41,970
we gotta

1650
01:35:43,170 --> 01:35:46,020
Adam Curry: fight for its
democracy. But the most well, I

1651
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:49,530
play one more clip and the and
then I think we were all clipped

1652
01:35:49,530 --> 01:35:52,920
out on this. I mean, we've
played clips from all sides. And

1653
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:55,260
there's a point to it, these
ladies would say we're looking

1654
01:35:55,260 --> 01:36:03,750
at which is BBC with. Hold on a
second. This is the BBC was this

1655
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:08,400
without? Oh, this is Daniel
Levy. He is the former Israeli

1656
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:09,720
peace negotiator,

1657
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:11,430
Unknown: the Israelis would say
we're looking at we are

1658
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:14,220
defending ourselves, we are
targeting Hamas targets in Gaza,

1659
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:18,000
we are trying to put an end to
what we believe is a terrorist

1660
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,620
organization once and for all.

1661
01:36:21,030 --> 01:36:22,050
Adam Curry: Let me think about
that.

1662
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:24,090
Unknown: Do you really keep a
straight face? When you say

1663
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:28,560
that? Do you think terrorist
organizations embedded in

1664
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:32,340
populations who are denied their
most basic rights are ended once

1665
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:35,790
and for all in a military
campaign? Does that happen in

1666
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:40,710
history? Can someone credibly
tell me that when the leadership

1667
01:36:40,710 --> 01:36:44,370
of a country says we are cutting
off food, electricity, water all

1668
01:36:44,370 --> 01:36:47,610
supplies to an entire civilian
population, that they're

1669
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:51,960
targeting militants? I'm sorry,
these kinds of lies can't be

1670
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:55,170
allowed to pass. And when you
tell yourself the lie, it leads

1671
01:36:55,170 --> 01:37:00,510
to the wrong policy. If anyone
told me that what the militants

1672
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:05,910
did on the weekend was a
legitimate response to years and

1673
01:37:05,910 --> 01:37:08,820
years of occupation, I would say
no, you're wrong headed. You've

1674
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:12,450
lost sight of humanity and
reality. And if anyone tells me

1675
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:15,660
that what Israel is doing in
Gaza today is a legitimate

1676
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:18,660
response to what happened on the
weekend. It's exactly the same.

1677
01:37:19,110 --> 01:37:21,450
And yet they are saying it and
yet the international community

1678
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:22,050
is saying

1679
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:25,590
people need to challenge them on
it, because it's a lie. And

1680
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:28,740
we're war mongering, if we allow
them to get away with it.

1681
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:34,230
Adam Curry: What team is he on?
The other team, according to the

1682
01:37:34,230 --> 01:37:38,250
president, whatever team so I
think we should just all remind

1683
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:44,010
ourselves, that war is a racket
is very good for business. Once

1684
01:37:44,010 --> 01:37:47,700
the money printer starts going,
war always has to be funded by

1685
01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:52,650
borrowing or printing and
borrowing is kind of two sides

1686
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:58,170
of the same thing. There's a lot
of a lot of financial markets

1687
01:37:58,170 --> 01:38:00,870
are waiting there. They'll
benefit from it. Everybody wants

1688
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:05,760
this. This is what it's about.
It has really very little to do

1689
01:38:06,150 --> 01:38:11,940
with Israel and Palestine,
Hamas, Jews Muslim, it's all

1690
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:12,570
just yeah,

1691
01:38:12,570 --> 01:38:15,480
John C Dvorak: we weren't
spending enough money. Nope. On

1692
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:17,010
Ukraine, we're trying to

1693
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,290
Adam Curry: well, we get we're
gonna we think somehow they've

1694
01:38:19,290 --> 01:38:22,830
already approved the four bagger
the 100 billion is already in

1695
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:28,050
the pocket somehow. For Israel,
it's well, it's for Israel and

1696
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:31,230
Ukraine. And what I'm hearing
now is that the President

1697
01:38:31,230 --> 01:38:34,740
tonight will ask Congress for
more, in addition to that 100

1698
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:37,410
billion, which I'm sure probably
he's coming from an accounting

1699
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,910
error inside the Pentagon.

1700
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:43,710
John C Dvorak: Well, he is he is
going to be jacked up.

1701
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:47,100
Adam Curry: I think you have
claimed he's talking about

1702
01:38:47,519 --> 01:38:50,429
John C Dvorak: it and about
where America we're America and

1703
01:38:50,519 --> 01:38:55,829
there's nothing we can't do. And
he's gonna yell at yell at, he's

1704
01:38:55,829 --> 01:39:00,719
gonna yell all that stuff that
if he's jacked up, and he's

1705
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:03,239
going to ask for a lot of money.
And as we heard from the LG

1706
01:39:03,239 --> 01:39:06,299
Azuro report, where that woman
was in the rotunda where they

1707
01:39:06,299 --> 01:39:10,769
were having the protests she
said they asked for a ceasefire

1708
01:39:10,769 --> 01:39:14,669
and the Congress and nobody's
now No, so it's everyone's gonna

1709
01:39:14,669 --> 01:39:18,839
be behind this at least our
legislator, people. We need war

1710
01:39:18,899 --> 01:39:22,619
you need we're all good. Good
for it. And so except for Rand

1711
01:39:22,619 --> 01:39:24,659
Paul, probably two other guys.

1712
01:39:25,530 --> 01:39:30,660
Adam Curry: Rand Paul be like,
it came from the Wuhan lab. Rand

1713
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:33,840
Paul, wrong talking point.
Goodbye. So

1714
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:37,770
John C Dvorak: Rand Paul say no
throw Fauci in jail. Yeah, yeah.

1715
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:40,620
And that'll be that and David,
we're gonna end up with this

1716
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:44,250
mess and, okay, I don't know how
they're gonna do it. Deal with

1717
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:48,540
it, but I think they're gonna
maybe we'll go boots on the

1718
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:51,540
ground would just pummel I still
think it would probably be. You

1719
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:53,940
can find the neighborhoods that
everyone knows where they are

1720
01:39:53,940 --> 01:39:58,530
where the mall is live. You rock
hound them to oblivion in that

1721
01:39:58,530 --> 01:39:59,220
area. Those

1722
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,220
Adam Curry: Will that and will
that settle Muslims around the

1723
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:03,720
world? Will that make them feel
boy? Yeah,

1724
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:06,960
John C Dvorak: everyone's good.
Well, you know, the she, she as

1725
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,980
Sunni thing is still a little
thing. Yes. About time you got

1726
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:15,060
those guys? Yeah. You know, no,
you have no idea.

1727
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:17,580
Adam Curry: No one has an idea
other than

1728
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,040
John C Dvorak: good for
business, it's

1729
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:26,220
Adam Curry: good for business.
Now I'm so worried about all

1730
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:31,710
these groups and people and you
remember the intellectual dark

1731
01:40:31,710 --> 01:40:37,770
web? Vaguely the intellectual
dark web? Yeah, it was the

1732
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:41,700
intellectuals. Well, now we have
something called the Westminster

1733
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:45,000
declaration. And I'm surprised
you were not asked to sign this.

1734
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:50,700
What is it? The Westminster
declaration? Quote, open

1735
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:54,120
discourse is the central pillar
of a free society.

1736
01:40:55,019 --> 01:40:57,869
John C Dvorak: Rather, yeah. So
this is twice as my second

1737
01:40:58,199 --> 01:40:59,099
brother for the day.

1738
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:04,500
Adam Curry: Yeah. Westminster
declaration.org. And I and I'll

1739
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:07,230
just read a little bit because
this just came to my attention.

1740
01:41:07,230 --> 01:41:11,970
I think it's relatively new. We
write as journalists, artists,

1741
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,020
authors, activist technologists,
and academics to warn of

1742
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:19,200
increasing international
censorship that threatens to

1743
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:23,010
erode centuries old democratic
norms,

1744
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:24,150
John C Dvorak: no.

1745
01:41:25,890 --> 01:41:28,620
Adam Curry: New you'd love it.
Coming from the left, right and

1746
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:31,620
center, we are united by our
commitment to universal human

1747
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:34,860
rights and freedom of speech.
And we are all deeply concerned

1748
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:37,440
about attempts to label
protected speech as

1749
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:43,440
misinformation, disinformation,
and other ill defined terms. The

1750
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:46,350
abuse of these terms has
resulted in the censorship of

1751
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:51,030
ordinary people, journalists and
dissidents in countries all over

1752
01:41:51,030 --> 01:41:54,870
the world. Across the globe,
government actors, social media,

1753
01:41:54,870 --> 01:41:58,260
companies, universities and NGOs
are increasingly working to

1754
01:41:58,260 --> 01:42:03,570
monitor citizens and rob them of
their voices. These large scale

1755
01:42:03,570 --> 01:42:06,720
coordinated efforts are
sometimes referred to as the

1756
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:11,580
censorship industrial complex. I
never heard that one. It's

1757
01:42:11,610 --> 01:42:16,440
what's only sometimes I do have
to write that down the

1758
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:22,740
censorship industrial complex.
So and they don't

1759
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:25,260
John C Dvorak: think about oh,
yeah,

1760
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:30,240
Adam Curry: they go on and on
and on. About. Let's see,

1761
01:42:30,540 --> 01:42:33,210
John C Dvorak: what's it got to
do with West minister? I don't

1762
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:36,360
know. What's the connection to
West ministry, Twitter

1763
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:39,030
Adam Curry: files revealed tech
five tech companies are often

1764
01:42:39,030 --> 01:42:42,450
performing since Oreo content
moderation in coordination with

1765
01:42:42,450 --> 01:42:47,190
God. So this is a bunch of
Yahoo's who are pissed off that

1766
01:42:47,190 --> 01:42:48,870
they don't control Twitter.

1767
01:42:50,010 --> 01:42:52,170
John C Dvorak: So you see,
there's a bunch of lefties. So

1768
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:53,130
I'm gonna, I'm gonna tell you

1769
01:42:53,130 --> 01:42:56,250
Adam Curry: who it is. But let
me first tell you what they what

1770
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:59,670
they for the sake of human
welfare and flourishing, we make

1771
01:42:59,670 --> 01:43:04,050
the following three calls to
action. We call on governments

1772
01:43:04,050 --> 01:43:05,970
and international organizations
to fulfill their

1773
01:43:05,970 --> 01:43:09,180
responsibilities to the people
and uphold article 19 of the

1774
01:43:09,180 --> 01:43:13,200
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. I don't even know what

1775
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:13,500
there's

1776
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:16,080
John C Dvorak: a copy of that.

1777
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:20,250
Adam Curry: Look up a copy. We
call on tech corporations to

1778
01:43:20,250 --> 01:43:23,730
undertake to protect the Digital
Public Square Twitter, as

1779
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:27,630
defined in article 19 of the
Universal Declaration on Human

1780
01:43:27,630 --> 01:43:30,240
Rights and refrain from
politically motivated

1781
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:33,390
censorship, the censorship of
Dissident Voices and censorship

1782
01:43:33,390 --> 01:43:37,620
of political opinion. These are
people who are so misguided.

1783
01:43:37,740 --> 01:43:42,300
They think that social media is
the Digital Public Square. And

1784
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:46,050
finally, we call on the general
public to join us in the fight

1785
01:43:46,290 --> 01:43:49,620
to preserve the people's
democratic rights. legislative

1786
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:53,100
changes are not enough. We must
also build an atmosphere of free

1787
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:55,830
speech from the ground up by
rejecting the climate of

1788
01:43:55,830 --> 01:43:58,590
intolerance that encourages self
censorship and creates

1789
01:43:58,620 --> 01:44:02,400
unnecessary personal Strife for
many, instead of fear and

1790
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:06,390
dogmatism. We must embrace
inquiry and debate. Who do you

1791
01:44:06,390 --> 01:44:11,910
think sign this? This is the
elite of the Twitterati ready?

1792
01:44:12,510 --> 01:44:16,920
I'm ready. Matt Taibbi
journalist us Michael

1793
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:25,440
Shellenberger Jonathan Haidt.
Steven Pinker. Tim Robbins.

1794
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:29,550
John C Dvorak: Tim Robbins,
actor, actor. Yes.

1795
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:36,090
Adam Curry: Richard Dawkins,
John Cleese, Oliver Stone.

1796
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:43,560
Edward Snowden, Glenn Greenwald,
Jordan, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.

1797
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:49,950
Barry Weiss, Peter Hitchens.
Niall Ferguson. Yamas viral

1798
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:56,850
Varoufakis is your buddy yeah,
the guy who we talked about

1799
01:44:56,970 --> 01:45:05,310
Chris Hedges ah, ally here. She
Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Let me find

1800
01:45:05,310 --> 01:45:08,160
some more that we know here.
It's not a lot of people, Brett

1801
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:13,770
Weinstein. People are

1802
01:45:13,770 --> 01:45:15,150
John C Dvorak: in there too,
Eric. No,

1803
01:45:15,150 --> 01:45:18,330
Adam Curry: he's not funny
enough. Is not let me see if

1804
01:45:18,330 --> 01:45:20,610
there's anyone else who has a
bunch of people I don't know.

1805
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:27,690
It's nothing. It's all you know,
college people. But this is done

1806
01:45:27,690 --> 01:45:31,950
in order of appearance. So I'm
presuming this is a, you know, a

1807
01:45:31,950 --> 01:45:36,390
tie EB Greenwald type thing. And
we all got a promotion for them.

1808
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:40,530
We all got together in
Westminster, then yeah, why is

1809
01:45:40,530 --> 01:45:44,370
John C Dvorak: the like, explain
it. Well, this is paralleling

1810
01:45:45,390 --> 01:45:49,350
the new FCC chairman who just
announced Yes, yeah, they're

1811
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:52,410
pulling back they're pulling
back on all the Trump stuff net

1812
01:45:52,410 --> 01:45:57,480
neutrality net neutrality back
in play, which means of course

1813
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:03,030
technically, net neutrality
means for example, I have one of

1814
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:09,210
my connections is Sonic and they
have a gigabyte or gigabit

1815
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:15,480
gigabit connection I can Yes.
And they have a two gigabit but

1816
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:18,840
it seems to me if I read net
neutrality correctly you can't

1817
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:19,650
do that

1818
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:24,270
Adam Curry: no, you have to give
everybody equal gigabits

1819
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:27,150
John C Dvorak: everybody has to
have the equal gigabits that

1820
01:46:27,150 --> 01:46:30,360
means instead of gay having the
opportunity to get two gigabits

1821
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:32,970
and I gotta give everybody two
gigabit now we're cutting back

1822
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:36,690
on your bits. So everything goes
down. So all it does is become a

1823
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:40,200
good becomes, you know, we go
back down we go to the mean, we

1824
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:44,160
go to the the we go, it
downgrades every that's what net

1825
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:48,330
neutrality is meant to do. Yes.
Dialog. Raise the speeds will

1826
01:46:48,330 --> 01:46:49,830
slow down. I

1827
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:54,600
Adam Curry: love for everybody.
Yes. No. We have looked at this

1828
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:59,580
ad nauseam years ago during
Obama within the Obama

1829
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:03,210
administration. And the main
sticking point for me because I

1830
01:47:03,210 --> 01:47:06,540
was I was walking the dog this
morning and reading this. I had

1831
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:09,150
read this before I went out and
like, Oh, they're gonna bring

1832
01:47:09,150 --> 01:47:15,630
this back. The main sticking
point was equal equal traffic,

1833
01:47:15,660 --> 01:47:20,070
except illegal traffic. You
remember that?

1834
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:22,170
John C Dvorak: Well, yeah,
they're just a way of getting

1835
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:23,400
porn off the internet,

1836
01:47:23,430 --> 01:47:28,140
Adam Curry: no illegal traffic,
it has nothing to do with the

1837
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:35,640
content. It is the protocol. So
Tor, and torrents would be seen

1838
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:37,320
as illegal content.

1839
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:40,320
John C Dvorak: Okay, that's
right. I'm trying to remember

1840
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:45,150
the trick. That's the trick.
Yes, to get rid of movie

1841
01:47:45,150 --> 01:47:46,710
sharing, or

1842
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:49,440
Adam Curry: you know, Tor is
good for you know, object

1843
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,870
John C Dvorak: storage good for
a lot of stuff is a fantastic

1844
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:56,070
product, a guy who did it is
something of a coding genius.

1845
01:47:56,670 --> 01:48:02,790
But if it's if deep packs, deep
packet sniffing is in play, you

1846
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:06,840
can see as a Tor stream, and it
once you recognize it, it

1847
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:10,710
becomes like, oh, no, you can't
do that. There goes all your

1848
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:13,950
people who download movies,
which is about 70% of the net.

1849
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:16,860
It'll free up some bandwidth,
that's for sure.

1850
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:25,680
Adam Curry: I did want to play
one last Israel clip so

1851
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:31,770
apparently, we got duped. The
clip of the laser dome was was a

1852
01:48:31,770 --> 01:48:37,680
hoax. The laser dome was a hoax.
That was supposedly footage from

1853
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:41,610
a video game. And it was not
true. So clip did

1854
01:48:41,610 --> 01:48:42,900
John C Dvorak: we play that was
a hoax. We

1855
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:45,060
Adam Curry: didn't play the
clip. I said that Sir Brian of

1856
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:47,340
London who was very apologetic
about this.

1857
01:48:48,330 --> 01:48:50,610
John C Dvorak: He said, Oh, that
yeah, you read his note. I

1858
01:48:50,610 --> 01:48:54,030
didn't. Yeah, I looked into this
too. In the meantime, after we

1859
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:57,090
win iced tea, but I made a
mistake. I've made a call bla

1860
01:48:57,090 --> 01:48:59,670
and this was I said, Why just
pay? I thought it was a Patriot

1861
01:48:59,670 --> 01:49:05,040
Missile system from Raytheon.
But no, it's developed by

1862
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:10,020
Israel. Yes. And it's a
completely alien system that I

1863
01:49:10,020 --> 01:49:11,400
guess it works well.

1864
01:49:11,430 --> 01:49:15,150
Adam Curry: Okay. So what we
immediately got was, it's fake.

1865
01:49:15,150 --> 01:49:18,720
It's a hoax. It's from video
game footage. It's not true. But

1866
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:22,200
then France. 24 does this.

1867
01:49:22,290 --> 01:49:25,170
Unknown: And now it's even more
tried to fill in the gaps, the

1868
01:49:25,170 --> 01:49:29,550
potential gaps in the Israeli
aerial system. The Israeli DOD

1869
01:49:29,550 --> 01:49:32,550
and the company have failed. The
Israeli company have been

1870
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:35,820
developing this time a laser
based anti missile defense

1871
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:39,660
system called the laser beam, as
you said, and according to some

1872
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:43,080
sources, close to the Israeli
DOD, they could indeed decide to

1873
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:47,400
deploy that system earlier than
what was expected. And one of

1874
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:50,340
the reasons why is that this is
actually a very cost effective

1875
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:54,900
system because it only cost
about $4 per launch compared to

1876
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:59,910
$50,000. I was talking about
with the Iron Dome. Now how does

1877
01:49:59,910 --> 01:50:03,210
it work this is a mobile laser
cannon that can really turn to

1878
01:50:03,570 --> 01:50:06,630
here you can see these pictures
footage from the company have

1879
01:50:06,630 --> 01:50:09,840
failed trying out its system,
but it can really turn to dust

1880
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:13,380
rockets, missiles, drones in a
split second, the laser beam is

1881
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:15,300
of about 100 kilowatts.

1882
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:18,210
Looking at some of the best
technology in the world at the

1883
01:50:18,210 --> 01:50:21,990
moment in terms of no defense
system, but the ion beam hasn't

1884
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:22,680
been deployed yet.

1885
01:50:22,710 --> 01:50:25,410
No. And it's important to stress
that because on social media

1886
01:50:25,410 --> 01:50:28,470
networks, we've been seeing
videos that purported to show

1887
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:33,030
this this this laser beam, but
it isn't actually this is a

1888
01:50:33,030 --> 01:50:36,720
fake. I want to show you those
pictures. These are a night

1889
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:40,200
pictures of course. But this is
actually footage from Arma three

1890
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:42,570
which is a video game that is
known because it's particularly

1891
01:50:42,690 --> 01:50:47,040
realistic with its realistic
graphics now, we are indeed when

1892
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,260
we're talking about these laser
beams, we are talking about the

1893
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:52,500
future of defense systems, many
countries around the world are

1894
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:55,830
trying to develop their own
systems here in France. Albion

1895
01:50:55,830 --> 01:50:59,490
for instance, is developing
something called Alma P which

1896
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:02,880
could actually be used by
security forces here in France

1897
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:08,280
to secure the French capital for
instance during the 2024

1898
01:51:08,490 --> 01:51:11,130
Olympics. Now all of these
systems that we've been talking

1899
01:51:11,130 --> 01:51:14,760
about have also been purchased
by other countries Germany for

1900
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:18,990
instance, recently purchased
arrow three and even Finland

1901
01:51:19,170 --> 01:51:22,290
purchase David slings anti
defense system

1902
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:27,810
Adam Curry: I love it direct the
real fire ran

1903
01:51:27,810 --> 01:51:30,600
John C Dvorak: a TV station I
would give this report and then

1904
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:35,370
I would have a video of an old
Apple two game called Missile

1905
01:51:35,370 --> 01:51:41,250
Command shooting the things out
of the air or and then cut the

1906
01:51:41,250 --> 01:51:46,800
Space Invaders Yeah, asteroids
asteroids because you have to

1907
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:49,320
have you know you have to have
some Twitch skills to be able to

1908
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:52,350
use these things although I'm
debt system I'm sure it's all

1909
01:51:52,350 --> 01:51:56,220
computerized you don't to do
anything. Push a button. Yeah,

1910
01:51:56,280 --> 01:52:00,450
this is bounded what eventually
that system has to go into play.

1911
01:52:00,990 --> 01:52:03,630
Adam Curry: Oh, yeah. Well, I
now the way she said this is

1912
01:52:03,630 --> 01:52:08,340
obviously night footage, but
it's from a game to me. They

1913
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:12,840
were using it to testing it out.
But what better opportunity to

1914
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:16,110
test it out right now. As he
goes over there, they're

1915
01:52:16,110 --> 01:52:19,470
accelerating it why wouldn't you
just use it? The French are

1916
01:52:19,470 --> 01:52:25,470
going to be frying people during
the Olympics. I don't know why.

1917
01:52:27,630 --> 01:52:31,830
I can just see them using it.
Now where am I not what a world

1918
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:35,610
we're in man. What a world we
got lasers that are the gist.

1919
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:40,050
And if you see the video, it
doesn't burn them up. It turns

1920
01:52:40,050 --> 01:52:44,040
them to dust. Well, Dad, I don't
believe well, that's what that

1921
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:47,160
was the demo was that that's
that's in the sales brochure. I

1922
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:50,400
think it's just disabled in the
brochure. Not Freising.

1923
01:52:50,850 --> 01:52:57,270
Freising, Miss cool. Very cool.
Okay, well, all this is going on

1924
01:52:57,270 --> 01:53:01,860
with everyone's focuses and
attention is on the Middle East

1925
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:05,940
and on Biden and Ben, just
everything. We're not even

1926
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:11,700
talking about Ukraine anymore.
Funny how that works. China that

1927
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:13,020
you go on, they're doing their
own thing.

1928
01:53:13,050 --> 01:53:16,560
Unknown: Morning Stewart. It was
launched in 2013. And he's one

1929
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:20,370
of Sujan pings a signature
signature policies. And as we're

1930
01:53:20,370 --> 01:53:22,350
about to see, it's really
undergone a Trump's

1931
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:26,490
transformation in the last 10
years. Beijing now says it has

1932
01:53:26,490 --> 01:53:30,480
inked Oh, close to $2 trillion
in contracts around the world

1933
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:34,920
contracts that cover a wide
array of different investments,

1934
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:39,960
roads, high speed rail, ports,
energy infrastructure, among

1935
01:53:39,990 --> 01:53:44,400
others. Over the course of 10
years, the number of signatories

1936
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:48,570
to the project has gone from
eight members in 2013 to now

1937
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:50,160
150. And this is the

1938
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:51,960
Adam Curry: Belt and Road
Initiative and they had a big

1939
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:55,320
meeting in China. Everyone
showed up Hey,

1940
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:57,090
John C Dvorak: Putin was there I
believe,

1941
01:53:57,390 --> 01:54:01,680
Adam Curry: Putin, he's like,
Hey, let's do our own thing.

1942
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:05,070
Unknown: Representatives from
about 130 countries are

1943
01:54:05,070 --> 01:54:08,370
gathering at this year's summit
in the Chinese capital many

1944
01:54:08,370 --> 01:54:11,340
arguments are made for and
against the Belton Road

1945
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:14,850
initiative. On the plus side,
it's been a much needed vector

1946
01:54:14,850 --> 01:54:19,170
for investments, development and
economic growth for global south

1947
01:54:19,170 --> 01:54:23,550
countries on the downside, it
has saddled many nations with

1948
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:27,960
huge levels of external debt
while in many instances also

1949
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:32,040
causing environment
environmental harm and inviting

1950
01:54:32,070 --> 01:54:34,590
opportunities for corruption.
But the Belton Road initiative

1951
01:54:34,590 --> 01:54:37,890
today is not the same project it
was 10 years ago, in part

1952
01:54:38,070 --> 01:54:41,580
because of a response to these
criticisms. Researchers have

1953
01:54:41,580 --> 01:54:44,820
found that as China's economic
growth is slowing down the days

1954
01:54:44,820 --> 01:54:49,290
of seemingly seemingly unlimited
overseas borrowing are coming to

1955
01:54:49,290 --> 01:54:52,770
an end to China's total overseas
development finances only just

1956
01:54:53,250 --> 01:55:00,150
below $5 billion in 2021. And
far from the peak seen in In

1957
01:55:00,150 --> 01:55:05,430
2016, just under $90 billion for
that year, that's because

1958
01:55:05,430 --> 01:55:09,960
China's overseas investment
policy is now to try and focus

1959
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:13,500
on smaller and greener projects.

1960
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:18,450
Adam Curry: Is China getting
caught up in the in global and

1961
01:55:18,450 --> 01:55:21,750
climate change? Or they do more
green projects?

1962
01:55:21,870 --> 01:55:24,840
John C Dvorak: I don't know what
that's all about seems unlikely

1963
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:27,690
to have avoided it like the
plague seems unlikely.

1964
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:33,630
Adam Curry: I'm, I'm thinking we
delayed just a little bit

1965
01:55:33,630 --> 01:55:35,880
longer. We get everything in
because I think that donation

1966
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:38,940
segmented being our 16 100th
episode will be a little longer

1967
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:39,660
than normal.

1968
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:43,770
John C Dvorak: It'll be long.
But I guess it might be my

1969
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:48,930
favorite story. I will say this
at the end of the show. Kind of

1970
01:55:48,930 --> 01:55:52,440
just kind of a pathetic story. I
got an oddball story about

1971
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:55,920
Venezuela that I thought was
like, where's just I haven't

1972
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:56,340
heard.

1973
01:55:56,910 --> 01:55:59,310
Unknown: The government of
Venezuelan President Nicolas

1974
01:55:59,310 --> 01:56:02,040
Maduro and opposition leaders
have agreed to new rules ahead

1975
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:05,340
of next year's presidential
election. The move is expected

1976
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:08,100
to clear the way for the United
States to ease its harsh

1977
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:11,520
sanctions on Venezuela, which
have wrecked the economy,

1978
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:14,910
forcing millions to flay. As
part of the agreement, the

1979
01:56:14,910 --> 01:56:17,910
Venezuelan Government will allow
all political parties to choose

1980
01:56:17,910 --> 01:56:20,790
their candidates grant
permission to delegations from

1981
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:23,610
the UN in the European Union to
observe elections and give equal

1982
01:56:23,610 --> 01:56:25,410
media access to all campaigns,

1983
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:27,780
Adam Curry: there was some kind
of deal. This is why the

1984
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:30,870
Venezuelans are getting
preferential treatment when they

1985
01:56:30,870 --> 01:56:31,410
show no

1986
01:56:31,410 --> 01:56:34,830
John C Dvorak: some deal went
down. Yeah, and this is just a

1987
01:56:34,830 --> 01:56:36,870
part of it. I don't know what
the whole thing is. But it has a

1988
01:56:36,870 --> 01:56:40,890
lot to do with getting oil back
on track, as we used to see, I

1989
01:56:40,890 --> 01:56:43,560
think the cynical or what they
said a guy who I forget which

1990
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:47,370
company but there's one company
that was a major provider of

1991
01:56:47,370 --> 01:56:51,180
gasoline in the United States.
And they sit go, maybe Citko

1992
01:56:51,780 --> 01:56:55,080
Yeah, I think so go, and they
would bring this Venezuelan

1993
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:58,740
crude and and refine it. And it
would be it's a big loss to us

1994
01:56:58,740 --> 01:57:02,670
not to have the Venezuelan crude
oil into our system for

1995
01:57:02,670 --> 01:57:06,330
gasoline. And I think that at
some point, we decided, you

1996
01:57:06,330 --> 01:57:10,830
know, it's better than we can
still talk a big game about not

1997
01:57:10,830 --> 01:57:13,890
drilling here, but we got to get
this Venezuelan oil on back

1998
01:57:13,890 --> 01:57:17,610
online. They're huge. They got a
monster field.

1999
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:19,770
Adam Curry: Right. Is that the
right kind of crude? Is it the

2000
01:57:19,830 --> 01:57:20,580
the good stuff?

2001
01:57:20,610 --> 01:57:25,440
John C Dvorak: It's a good crude
for us? Yeah, yeah. It's not a

2002
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:30,480
dirty crude. Well, we looked it
up. But my understanding is that

2003
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:32,700
most of the South American crude
is pretty clean, but we've

2004
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:34,950
Adam Curry: got a lot of
Venezuelans coming into the

2005
01:57:34,950 --> 01:57:38,640
United States. And oh, man, I
actually I should I should play.

2006
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:44,400
I've got two migration
replacement clips. The first one

2007
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:48,630
is an update from Chicago. Oh,
my goodness. It is not good in

2008
01:57:48,630 --> 01:57:53,910
Chicago, that there's like 40
buses a day showing up. And this

2009
01:57:53,910 --> 01:57:57,360
is a local Chicago report. The
Chicago ones are mad that

2010
01:57:57,360 --> 01:58:00,330
getting really mad now what's
happening. We are learning

2011
01:58:00,330 --> 01:58:02,940
Unknown: much more about the
migrant crisis here in Chicago.

2012
01:58:03,120 --> 01:58:06,660
I spoke to Christina Pacioli as
is the city's first Deputy Chief

2013
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:09,870
of Staff. She gave me insight on
how the crisis is impacting the

2014
01:58:09,870 --> 01:58:12,120
city and state financially.

2015
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:15,360
We have more people coming in
than we actually have

2016
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:18,360
transitioning out of shelters.

2017
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:22,410
Already this week. 41 buses have
rolled into Chicago that means

2018
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:26,640
there are now 11,000 migrants
living in shelters. 4000 are

2019
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:29,490
still sleeping on police station
floors and staying at the

2020
01:58:29,490 --> 01:58:35,430
airports. There have been calls
by city officials to close the

2021
01:58:35,430 --> 01:58:37,830
end of Chicago shelter site
after report.

2022
01:58:38,010 --> 01:58:40,650
Adam Curry: This is really
interesting. The enough Chicago

2023
01:58:40,650 --> 01:58:45,120
shelter site and they have this
picture in of Chicago Miracle

2024
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:47,940
Mile. So this is on the Miracle
Mile which is the shopping

2025
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:48,390
street.

2026
01:58:48,450 --> 01:58:50,580
John C Dvorak: Yes, the base.
The main part of this the best

2027
01:58:50,580 --> 01:58:51,720
part of town in of

2028
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:55,200
Adam Curry: Chicago is is a kind
of a nice hotel. It's not a

2029
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:59,190
shelter spot. They're paying
this hotel, and of course the

2030
01:58:59,190 --> 01:59:03,090
hotels like be as good. Bring
them all in here. But it's not

2031
01:59:03,090 --> 01:59:06,000
like the Roosevelt, New York.
This is a nice hotel, and the

2032
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:11,910
website is up and this is like
no vacancies. Yeah. No kidding.

2033
01:59:12,570 --> 01:59:12,900
Here we go.

2034
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:16,800
John C Dvorak: know, when I go
to the airport, I see a bunch of

2035
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:19,500
people camped around in the
airport. And that's really

2036
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:20,610
inexcusable.

2037
01:59:20,940 --> 01:59:24,060
Adam Curry: Oh, and you see it
upon arrival. It's in the

2038
01:59:24,060 --> 01:59:27,630
arrivals hall. But they have the
curtains around them and stuff,

2039
01:59:27,630 --> 01:59:31,170
which is that's very humane,
though. So humane. There have

2040
01:59:31,170 --> 01:59:33,510
Unknown: been calls by city
officials to close enough

2041
01:59:33,510 --> 01:59:36,840
Chicago shelter site after
reports of criminal behavior

2042
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:40,620
including drug sales and
prostitution. Pasi Yonis. Is

2043
01:59:40,620 --> 01:59:42,810
says it's not shutting down.

2044
01:59:43,110 --> 01:59:45,510
We are in a lease. You know,
that's the other thing.

2045
01:59:45,810 --> 01:59:50,160
Adam Curry: We're in a lease. So
I guess they've leased the

2046
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:55,200
entire Chicago Hotel. The city
has just leased it is crazy

2047
01:59:55,230 --> 01:59:55,950
paying top

2048
01:59:55,950 --> 01:59:56,820
John C Dvorak: dollar. Oh yeah.

2049
01:59:56,849 --> 01:59:59,489
Unknown: This chart shows the
number of migrant children now

2050
01:59:59,489 --> 02:00:03,089
enrolled. Within the Chicago
Public Schools 30% of migrants

2051
02:00:03,089 --> 02:00:06,719
here in Chicago are children.
That migrant crisis is straining

2052
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:10,319
resources. The state is footing
the bill for what they call

2053
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:14,519
temporary housing. The state is
paying on the high end $9,000 in

2054
02:00:14,519 --> 02:00:18,179
rental assistance over a six
month period of time with that

2055
02:00:18,179 --> 02:00:21,239
comes out moving in and a
starter kit to furnish the

2056
02:00:21,239 --> 02:00:21,899
apartment

2057
02:00:21,930 --> 02:00:26,430
Adam Curry: star kid. Here's a
vase for flowers

2058
02:00:26,730 --> 02:00:30,480
Unknown: that read last for six
months and ideally, people would

2059
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:34,890
have started their legal
process, secured legal work

2060
02:00:34,890 --> 02:00:38,580
authorization and then be able
to sustain that apartment. The

2061
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:38,910
city

2062
02:00:38,910 --> 02:00:42,390
put $4 million towards helping
migrants get temporary housing.

2063
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:45,150
Right now there are just a
handful of case managers to

2064
02:00:45,150 --> 02:00:49,140
handle the load to get migrants
in temporary rentals. We did

2065
02:00:49,140 --> 02:00:51,990
reach out to see how many asylum
seekers are currently taking

2066
02:00:51,990 --> 02:00:54,930
advantage of the rental
assistance. We haven't heard

2067
02:00:54,930 --> 02:00:56,760
back from the city on that.

2068
02:00:58,110 --> 02:00:59,670
John C Dvorak: Well, that's got
to go over big with the

2069
02:00:59,670 --> 02:01:00,420
residents.

2070
02:01:00,450 --> 02:01:03,750
Adam Curry: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I'm sure Airbnb is in on it.

2071
02:01:05,010 --> 02:01:05,940
John C Dvorak: Oh, absolutely.

2072
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:10,650
Adam Curry: They have to be so
in New York. Mayor Eric Adams.

2073
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:18,030
To he up. This kind of shows you
how much bullcrap AI is. So they

2074
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:24,120
use a robocall system, which
transmogrified the mayor's voice

2075
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:25,740
into different languages.

2076
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:28,950
John C Dvorak: Yeah, a couple of
two or three languages. Now.

2077
02:01:28,950 --> 02:01:31,950
Adam Curry: I mean, this is this
is the same as calling anything

2078
02:01:31,950 --> 02:01:37,830
blockchain. We have a pet store,
we use blockchain. Now we're

2079
02:01:37,830 --> 02:01:44,280
using AI says Mayor Adams AI is
here is hair, I'm using it. I'm

2080
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:45,600
awesome. using

2081
02:01:45,630 --> 02:01:50,010
Unknown: AI to improve the
delivery of goods and services

2082
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:52,830
is what we're going to do. And
we're going to all look back on

2083
02:01:52,830 --> 02:01:56,550
this one day and say, You know
what, this guy, Eric had it

2084
02:01:56,550 --> 02:01:58,590
right. I know we have a right

2085
02:02:00,150 --> 02:02:01,140
Adam Curry: from the future. And

2086
02:02:01,140 --> 02:02:04,380
Unknown: so those who sit on the
sidelines, wake up in the

2087
02:02:04,380 --> 02:02:07,590
morning, and say, let me see,
we're going to criticize Eric

2088
02:02:07,590 --> 02:02:11,820
about today. Jeff, we're going
to use it. It's not against the

2089
02:02:11,820 --> 02:02:17,910
law. So people want it.

2090
02:02:19,830 --> 02:02:21,300
John C Dvorak: Well, I was gonna
bring you down with a clip, I

2091
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:24,870
have a question that more
generalized, but I'll ask it

2092
02:02:24,870 --> 02:02:29,790
now. Why not find a person
that's fluent in the language

2093
02:02:29,790 --> 02:02:32,730
and have them deliver the
messages over the phone, as

2094
02:02:32,730 --> 02:02:37,380
opposed to some bulky version of
that guy was can barely get a

2095
02:02:37,590 --> 02:02:42,180
sentence out without sounding
silly? And get you know, have

2096
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:47,250
you flew? Hiring a fluent person
to do this? Why don't you do

2097
02:02:47,250 --> 02:02:51,360
that instead of this nonsense?
Well, obviously,

2098
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:55,050
Adam Curry: there's some pay off
some some buddy of his has an AI

2099
02:02:55,050 --> 02:03:00,330
company. I mean, you know,
Spotify did a big announcement,

2100
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:04,950
where Spotify. Now if you upload
your podcasts or Spotify, we

2101
02:03:04,950 --> 02:03:09,120
will translate your voice into
Portuguese into Spanish into

2102
02:03:09,120 --> 02:03:13,530
German into French into every
language imaginable. You know,

2103
02:03:13,530 --> 02:03:17,850
it's always interesting to me.
You never hear anyone promoting

2104
02:03:18,150 --> 02:03:22,680
the, the opposite direction. You
never hear someone saying, Wow,

2105
02:03:22,830 --> 02:03:27,210
we're now using this. So you can
listen in English to podcasts in

2106
02:03:27,210 --> 02:03:31,500
French. You know why? Because we
would only have to listen to

2107
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:34,470
three seconds of it. And we'd be
laughing about how horrible it

2108
02:03:34,470 --> 02:03:40,110
is. Because you know, it sucks.
You know that it sucks. It just

2109
02:03:40,260 --> 02:03:42,210
John C Dvorak: gotta suck. Suck.

2110
02:03:43,830 --> 02:03:47,820
Unknown: Because what are your
voice? The people want to hear

2111
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:48,930
that man's voice.

2112
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:51,990
Adam Curry: It's also a bit of
ego, I think,

2113
02:03:52,019 --> 02:03:54,269
Unknown: tell me you do not
enjoy waking up in the morning.

2114
02:03:54,269 --> 02:03:59,939
You hear my voice? You know,
people think about the seat at

2115
02:03:59,939 --> 02:04:04,859
the money. The problems that we
have, is that those of us who

2116
02:04:05,009 --> 02:04:11,099
are able to enjoy life from our
normal space. We think everyone

2117
02:04:11,099 --> 02:04:11,939
feels that way.

2118
02:04:12,270 --> 02:04:14,940
Adam Curry: Well, because you
know, the we want to make

2119
02:04:14,970 --> 02:04:18,510
migrants feel comfortable when
they come here illegally. We

2120
02:04:18,510 --> 02:04:21,930
want their space to be
normalized. Do you know how

2121
02:04:21,930 --> 02:04:30,690
empowering it is? If you speak
or do or, or do you know how

2122
02:04:30,690 --> 02:04:34,140
empowering it is? If you can
speak Urdu? Yeah, I feel very

2123
02:04:34,140 --> 02:04:34,830
powerful.

2124
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,710
Unknown: And all of a sudden you
hear in the voice of your

2125
02:04:37,710 --> 02:04:39,840
mayor's speaking your language.

2126
02:04:39,870 --> 02:04:43,770
Adam Curry: It's so empowering
Mayor Adams, it's really believe

2127
02:04:43,770 --> 02:04:47,430
me? The Venezuelans feel
empowered because of this.

2128
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:49,230
That's empowering

2129
02:04:49,230 --> 02:04:53,100
Unknown: to people. And it's we
don't understand it because we

2130
02:04:53,370 --> 02:04:57,240
always hear English. Everyone is
talking in English, but this is

2131
02:04:57,240 --> 02:05:01,470
a city that's diverse. And you
know Uh, I know what I hear from

2132
02:05:01,470 --> 02:05:04,680
my constituents that speak
different language. Hey, I heard

2133
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:08,730
that robo call from you. Thank
you understood it. And this is

2134
02:05:08,730 --> 02:05:10,710
the right thing to do and we're
gonna do it.

2135
02:05:11,940 --> 02:05:15,480
Adam Curry: Let me see. Do you
think that there's an example of

2136
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:19,890
his robo call in Urdu? Do you
have one? Well I know that you

2137
02:05:19,890 --> 02:05:22,320
mentioned it let me see if
there's one available

2138
02:05:23,610 --> 02:05:26,430
John C Dvorak: there's got to be
viewed think so. I want to hit

2139
02:05:26,430 --> 02:05:27,570
the Chinese version.

2140
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:32,100
Adam Curry: I'm I'm thinking now
I'm thinking like what companies

2141
02:05:32,130 --> 02:05:33,150
in on this?

2142
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:36,840
John C Dvorak: Yeah, it's
definitely some operation

2143
02:05:36,840 --> 02:05:40,440
there's some corruption involves
New York. Yeah,

2144
02:05:40,469 --> 02:05:43,259
Adam Curry: let me see now
unfortunately, fortunately,

2145
02:05:43,289 --> 02:05:44,249
it'll come out Oh, come

2146
02:05:44,250 --> 02:05:45,270
John C Dvorak: on to wash. Yeah,

2147
02:05:45,299 --> 02:05:48,749
Adam Curry: I can't wait. I'm
very excited to hear to hear the

2148
02:05:48,749 --> 02:05:49,739
mayor in Urdu.

2149
02:05:50,700 --> 02:05:52,440
John C Dvorak: Yeah, or do
especially

2150
02:05:53,309 --> 02:05:56,879
Adam Curry: using AI to fake his
voice in always doing ads as

2151
02:05:56,879 --> 02:06:05,519
well not just robo calls.
Interesting. Yeah. Anything

2152
02:06:05,519 --> 02:06:07,799
else? Well,

2153
02:06:08,580 --> 02:06:10,200
John C Dvorak: are we gonna
Hallows or segment going to be

2154
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:12,060
at the end? Probably not too
long. So we should probably get

2155
02:06:12,060 --> 02:06:17,040
this out of the way. Okay. This
is the I think is pathetic

2156
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:20,370
stories played. In an
unfortunate way. There's the

2157
02:06:20,370 --> 02:06:21,630
black man story.

2158
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:25,770
Adam Curry: I'm gonna have to do
this morning. AMY GOODMAN

2159
02:06:25,770 --> 02:06:29,130
flippin bound. I'm sorry.
Everybody is a lot of people got

2162
02:06:33,330 --> 02:06:34,770
John C Dvorak: well, I got a lot
of AMI clips today.

2163
02:06:34,770 --> 02:06:37,650
Unknown: Back in the US in
Georgia. A man who was

2164
02:06:37,650 --> 02:06:40,290

Monday, Leonard Allen cure a

2166
02:06:43,980 --> 02:06:46,410
black man was driving on a
highway in Camden County near

2167
02:06:46,410 --> 02:06:48,840
the Georgia Florida State Line
when a sheriff's deputy pulled

2168
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:51,630
them over reportedly for
speeding the officer notified

2169
02:06:51,630 --> 02:06:54,840
him he'd be arrested before
shocking him with a taser at

2170
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:57,630
least twice speeding him with a
baton then fatally shooting him.

2171
02:06:57,900 --> 02:07:01,590
The 53 year old man was released
from a Florida prison in 2020.

2172
02:07:01,740 --> 02:07:04,740
After he was exonerated for an
armed robbery conviction from

2173
02:07:04,740 --> 02:07:08,760
2004. Since his release, he
often gave inspirational talks

2174
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:12,060
to high school students and it
plans to go to college.

2175
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:16,230
John C Dvorak: I just don't
believe this story is giving us

2176
02:07:16,230 --> 02:07:17,490
all the details now.

2177
02:07:17,490 --> 02:07:18,480
Adam Curry: I'm sure it's not

2178
02:07:19,560 --> 02:07:23,430
John C Dvorak: bad cop, I guess
pulled over for speeding and

2179
02:07:23,430 --> 02:07:28,710
killed him. But it sounds like
because he's black. So and he

2180
02:07:28,710 --> 02:07:29,700
wanted to go to college.

2181
02:07:30,210 --> 02:07:34,080
Adam Curry: That's Amy. I mean,
you know, how can you even play

2182
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:34,890
her anymore?

2183
02:07:35,519 --> 02:07:36,689
John C Dvorak: I love it.

2184
02:07:38,340 --> 02:07:41,250
Adam Curry: All right. Let me I
need to do this, I need to do

2185
02:07:41,250 --> 02:07:45,930
this. Now it's time for our
friends malice to self destruct

2186
02:07:45,930 --> 02:07:50,820
initiated trans mouse update,
which as you know, contains a

2187
02:07:50,820 --> 02:07:55,080
lot of different things. And the
first one is just I have to read

2188
02:07:55,080 --> 02:08:03,150
this. This is what this from
this was a owe them.us is a

2189
02:08:03,150 --> 02:08:06,900
great publication. And I'll just
I'll just read this. I'm an

2190
02:08:06,900 --> 02:08:10,920
Israeli trans woman who
desperately needs Palestine to

2191
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:15,270
be free. I need this because I
refuse to accept that the

2192
02:08:15,270 --> 02:08:18,900
massacres peaceful protesters in
Gaza is something that my people

2193
02:08:18,900 --> 02:08:22,350
keep doing. I need this because
I understand that trans

2194
02:08:22,350 --> 02:08:27,120
liberation and Palestinian
Liberation are linked. You

2195
02:08:27,120 --> 02:08:29,490
starting to figure out how this
all works. This is why people

2196
02:08:29,490 --> 02:08:33,510
are on the street. But also it's
another flag is another cool

2197
02:08:33,510 --> 02:08:37,410
flag we can fly. About 10 months
ago, I figured out the flag yes

2198
02:08:37,410 --> 02:08:43,650
new flag. That's a good title to
a new flag. About 10 months ago,

2199
02:08:43,710 --> 02:08:46,440
I figured out that I wanted to
start hormone replacement

2200
02:08:46,440 --> 02:08:49,770
therapy and in that way
medically transition. There were

2201
02:08:49,770 --> 02:08:51,810
many reasons for this decision.
But one of them was the

2202
02:08:51,810 --> 02:08:55,290
realization that growing up
Israeli and trans in Jerusalem,

2203
02:08:55,500 --> 02:08:59,130
while being expected to become a
Zionist man left an aftermath in

2204
02:08:59,130 --> 02:09:05,520
my body. Wow, I needed help to
heal and since the growing

2205
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:08,190
around her more tender body
would help me connect with the

2206
02:09:08,190 --> 02:09:11,850
justice loving feminine child
inside of me. And having such a

2207
02:09:11,850 --> 02:09:17,790
body would help me grow from
that soft place. Anyway, so that

2208
02:09:17,790 --> 02:09:21,840
goes on and on and on and on.
And then so I waited until the

2209
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:25,200
Jewish new year to go to my
pharmacy and start that phase in

2210
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:29,280
my transition. I imagine the
little ritual I will do while

2211
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:34,020
taking that first teal colored
pill New Year New Jew new me.

2212
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:37,620
But when the pharmacy handed me
the bottles with my medication,

2213
02:09:37,770 --> 02:09:40,650
I looked at the label that read
produced by Teva

2214
02:09:40,650 --> 02:09:46,530
Pharmaceuticals, and my heart
stopped. Teva or Teva? I guess,

2215
02:09:46,830 --> 02:09:49,650
a word meaning nature and Hebrew
is an Israeli owned

2216
02:09:49,650 --> 02:09:52,890
pharmaceutical company that I
have vaguely heard about as a

2217
02:09:52,890 --> 02:09:56,490
participant in the economy of
the occupation. This must be a

2218
02:09:56,490 --> 02:09:59,580
mistake, I thought, excuse me, I
said when I went back to the

2219
02:09:59,580 --> 02:10:02,520
pharmacist This estrogen is
produced by an Israeli company.

2220
02:10:02,640 --> 02:10:05,580
I'm a supporter of BDS. Could I
please have a prescription from

2221
02:10:05,580 --> 02:10:08,640
a different manufacturer? No,
we're sorry. That's the only

2222
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:12,600
manufacturer we carry. The
pharmacist quickly replied. I

2223
02:10:12,630 --> 02:10:18,180
was in shock. How could this?
How could this be? I texted all

2224
02:10:18,180 --> 02:10:21,540
my medicalized trans sisters on
my way home and asked the simple

2225
02:10:21,540 --> 02:10:24,210
question, who makes your
hormones? Many of them didn't

2226
02:10:24,210 --> 02:10:26,730
know offhand. It takes a great
deal of struggle and an intense

2227
02:10:26,730 --> 02:10:28,920
amount of questioning for many
trans folks to get their hands

2228
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:32,940
on this life saving medication.
And once we do, we want to start

2229
02:10:32,940 --> 02:10:35,400
immediately and experience and
enter questions regarding the

2230
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:38,490
validity of identity and our
choices. But my sisters heard

2231
02:10:38,490 --> 02:10:41,610
the urgency you might call and
checked in, and the responses

2232
02:10:41,610 --> 02:10:44,910
came every single one was either
Teva, or company that a quick

2233
02:10:44,910 --> 02:10:48,720
Google search listed as linked
to them. How did this one

2234
02:10:48,720 --> 02:10:51,900
Israeli company play such a
large role in the cross gender

2235
02:10:51,900 --> 02:10:55,170
hormone market? How did my body
once again find itself as a

2236
02:10:55,170 --> 02:10:59,400
battleground? A settlement, an
ongoing pawn in this Zionist

2237
02:10:59,400 --> 02:11:05,310
game? I feel so bad for these
people.

2238
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:10,020
John C Dvorak: So we need to get
a jingle for these reads.

2239
02:11:10,950 --> 02:11:12,960
Adam Curry: Oh, what would you
call them?

2240
02:11:13,860 --> 02:11:16,290
John C Dvorak: Well, they're
they're they're interesting. I

2241
02:11:16,290 --> 02:11:18,540
don't know yet. I can come up
with a name

2242
02:11:18,600 --> 02:11:21,690
Adam Curry: for it. Pearl clutch
kind of in a way. It's the

2243
02:11:22,530 --> 02:11:25,020
John C Dvorak: pearl clutching
with Adam curry.

2244
02:11:26,850 --> 02:11:29,040
Adam Curry: Let's let's all
clutch our pearls.

2245
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:33,360
John C Dvorak: All right, that's
not a bad name. Pearl.

2246
02:11:34,830 --> 02:11:40,470
Adam Curry: It's a new podcast,
Pearl clutching podcast. And

2247
02:11:40,470 --> 02:11:43,770
then one final clip just to make
sure that we all know exactly

2248
02:11:43,770 --> 02:11:47,460
what the agenda is. This is from
I believe the Canada's new

2249
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:49,770
Democrat Party. Isn't that to
dos party?

2250
02:11:50,670 --> 02:11:53,760
John C Dvorak: You see that he's
he's he's a liberal I Liberal

2251
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:55,800
Party. Isn't the liberals?

2252
02:11:56,400 --> 02:12:00,090
Adam Curry: Who's In Who's the
liberal? Oh, okay. Well, he

2253
02:12:00,090 --> 02:12:03,900
shouldn't be with this one. This
is the new Democrat party's

2254
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:07,350
convention. And before they
started off first everybody a

2255
02:12:07,350 --> 02:12:08,610
few ground rules,

2256
02:12:08,640 --> 02:12:12,390
Unknown: a reminder that we will
enforce gender parity at the

2257
02:12:12,390 --> 02:12:16,980
mics and a julienne explain the
process with the yellow card as

2258
02:12:16,980 --> 02:12:22,110
well. So please remember to give
space to those who face systemic

2259
02:12:22,110 --> 02:12:26,010
barriers and discrimination
including women, black,

2260
02:12:26,010 --> 02:12:29,820
indigenous and racialized folk
in particular, people living

2261
02:12:29,820 --> 02:12:36,870
with disabilities and to LGBTQIA
plus folk. Our convention has

2262
02:12:36,870 --> 02:12:41,130
special speaker priority for
gender equity if you identify

2263
02:12:41,130 --> 02:12:44,490
with a gender other than men for
the purpose of the equity

2264
02:12:44,490 --> 02:12:47,640
speaking rule, you will have
received a piece of yellow

2265
02:12:47,640 --> 02:12:51,630
cardstock during the
registration process so please

2266
02:12:51,630 --> 02:12:54,960
raise this piece of yellow
cardstock when you arrive at the

2267
02:12:54,960 --> 02:13:00,480
mic so that myself and Adrian as
chairs can identify you easily

2268

trolls troll room.io Or if you

2310
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:31,620
prefer, you can get a modern
podcast that podcast apps.com

2311
02:15:31,620 --> 02:15:33,660
You'll need it believe me
eventually you're gonna need it

2312
02:15:33,660 --> 02:15:36,990
because things are gonna get
start to platforms as it's

2313
02:15:36,990 --> 02:15:41,100
already happening to many
podcasts. So get one a podcast

2314
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:45,000
John C Dvorak: crew. Well What
have you heard?

2315
02:15:45,389 --> 02:15:50,399
Adam Curry: Well, they the
platform stuff every week. Every

2316
02:15:50,399 --> 02:15:55,079
week conspiracy disinformation
misinformation. Oh, yeah. It's

2317
02:15:55,079 --> 02:16:00,119
gone all the time. Can you get
Alex Jones on Apple podcasts?

2318
02:16:00,809 --> 02:16:01,829
You see? Oh, that's

2319
02:16:01,830 --> 02:16:02,850
John C Dvorak: been for years.
You're

2320
02:16:02,850 --> 02:16:04,230
Adam Curry: horribly dangerous
man.

2321
02:16:05,550 --> 02:16:06,930
John C Dvorak: Not by my
standard. You

2322
02:16:06,930 --> 02:16:10,110
Adam Curry: get monkey works on
Apple podcasts. Never heard of

2323
02:16:10,110 --> 02:16:14,250
it. Monkey works. Yeah, we've
talked about monkey works. Yeah,

2324
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:18,000
no, you can't get any of that
stuff. Oh, no. And it's not just

2325
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:23,280
that. This is all this is
happens all the time. I'd say

2326
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:29,820
they remove on average eight to
10 podcasts a week. And I'll get

2327
02:16:29,850 --> 02:16:32,790
I'll get a list. I will gladly
get a list for you. Oh, yeah, we

2328
02:16:32,790 --> 02:16:37,860
should have a list. Yeah, yes,
it should be an honor roll. But

2329
02:16:37,860 --> 02:16:40,710
get one of those because it
alerts you when we go live and

2330
02:16:40,710 --> 02:16:44,250
as the bad signal has a live
stream that has the troll room

2331
02:16:44,250 --> 02:16:50,040
it's it's it's really It's good
stuff. You can also you can also

2332
02:16:50,040 --> 02:16:53,610
follow us at no agenda
social.com Which I'm not barely

2333
02:16:53,610 --> 02:16:59,070
active on it's got so bad on no
agenda social.

2334
02:16:59,940 --> 02:17:02,940
John C Dvorak: Okay, notice it
changing one iota one way or the

2335
02:17:02,940 --> 02:17:03,630
other. Well,

2336
02:17:03,629 --> 02:17:07,109
Adam Curry: I look at the look
at stuff that everyone's

2337
02:17:07,109 --> 02:17:11,219
posting, posting not just stuff
I follow. And all I see is you

2338
02:17:11,219 --> 02:17:15,329
know, anti Jew memes anti EU
Palestine anti Muslim, and it's

2339
02:17:15,329 --> 02:17:18,509
all all sides of it. Everyone's
all and it's all posting from

2340
02:17:18,509 --> 02:17:22,919
other places. Every link is to
something on Twitter or Reddit

2341
02:17:22,919 --> 02:17:26,759
or somewhere else is writtens
isn't almost no original

2342
02:17:26,759 --> 02:17:27,449
thought.

2343
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:32,310
John C Dvorak: I guess that's
what social media I guess, the

2344
02:17:32,310 --> 02:17:32,730
point of

2345
02:17:32,730 --> 02:17:35,640
Adam Curry: social media. But I
would also like to thank Aaron

2346
02:17:35,640 --> 02:17:38,610
are for keeping that running out
of the goodness of his heart. He

2347
02:17:38,610 --> 02:17:42,630
took that over for me years ago.
I started that and it was about

2348
02:17:42,660 --> 02:17:45,420
a year and a half two years into
him like this is too much work.

2349
02:17:45,990 --> 02:17:49,710
There's too much to do. So he's
been an excellent steward of

2350
02:17:49,710 --> 02:17:53,760
that. Now he also posted about
about what I've been saying

2351
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:57,180
about no agenda social he says
hey, you know everybody, it is

2352
02:17:57,180 --> 02:18:00,180
what you make out of it. Oh,
there you go. Yeah, I don't see

2353
02:18:00,180 --> 02:18:02,400
you posting that often. Post

2354
02:18:02,400 --> 02:18:03,210
John C Dvorak: constantly.

2355
02:18:03,209 --> 02:18:04,589
Adam Curry: What are you posting
memes

2356
02:18:05,910 --> 02:18:08,460
John C Dvorak: if I can find a
good meme I'll post it for sure.

2357
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:12,600
Adam Curry: I love how this is
contingent on the origin of

2358
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:16,440
social that things Adam hates
memes like oh you do no I don't

2359
02:18:16,440 --> 02:18:16,740
I hate

2360
02:18:16,740 --> 02:18:18,960
John C Dvorak: bad I'm in that
contingent by the way.

2361
02:18:20,490 --> 02:18:25,110
Adam Curry: I only hate bad
memes it stems from the

2362
02:18:25,110 --> 02:18:28,800
knowledge of how much storage
space that sucks up by everyone.

2363
02:18:29,370 --> 02:18:33,810
Oh, there you have it a posting
all of these pictures. The back

2364
02:18:33,810 --> 02:18:38,820
end? Yeah, the back end in the
back end suffers people. Hey,

2365
02:18:38,940 --> 02:18:40,440
you're not the boss of us.

2366
02:18:43,049 --> 02:18:44,009
John C Dvorak: They just say
that.

2367
02:18:44,040 --> 02:18:49,320
Adam Curry: Oh, yeah, many, many
I'm not. I'm becoming you. I'm

2368
02:18:49,320 --> 02:18:52,200
starting to block people's like,
I don't want to see you anymore.

2369
02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:52,650
I'm just not

2370
02:18:53,910 --> 02:18:56,520
John C Dvorak: there's always a
practical method was blocking P

2371
02:18:56,520 --> 02:18:58,140
No, but like you're becoming me

2372
02:18:58,259 --> 02:19:01,019
Adam Curry: know I'm becoming
you. I am I'm becoming you. And

2373
02:19:01,019 --> 02:19:05,189
you're becoming blocked and
you're becoming me. Because

2374
02:19:05,219 --> 02:19:07,319
people have noticed you're
cussing a lot more.

2375
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:10,530
John C Dvorak: I've tried to
keep the cussing to zero. Yeah,

2376
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:13,020
but that's failing. You're
failing is a lot of cussing. I

2377
02:19:13,020 --> 02:19:14,340
haven't cut today once

2378
02:19:14,370 --> 02:19:20,100
Adam Curry: True. True. But the
show's not over. Not on over No,

2379
02:19:20,100 --> 02:19:23,280
I love the memes that I'm in you
idiots. Now if you have a meme

2380
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:27,120
about me I love them but then he
just was a narcissistic mean

2381
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:29,940
yeah, they're rarely any good.
There's a couple of good ones

2382
02:19:29,940 --> 02:19:33,420
I've seen of you the one where
I'm all like on fire that one

2383
02:19:34,950 --> 02:19:37,230
John C Dvorak: I didn't see that
one that's probably good. I'd

2384
02:19:37,230 --> 02:19:38,190
like to challenge right

2385
02:19:38,280 --> 02:19:40,980
Adam Curry: like the ones where
I'm on fire. Now I just have

2386
02:19:40,980 --> 02:19:44,850
other things to do with my life
that's all this you know adhere

2387
02:19:44,850 --> 02:19:47,610
to here. There's no agenda
social use to make me smile used

2388
02:19:47,610 --> 02:19:51,150
to make me happy. But now it's
just memes do it's just but no,

2389
02:19:51,150 --> 02:19:55,260
it's doom and gloom. And then
it's like, everything sucks.

2390
02:19:55,260 --> 02:19:58,710
It's now it's not funny. I don't
know. I can't put my finger on

2391
02:19:58,710 --> 02:20:03,240
it. I guess But if it's good
enough for you, then you should

2392
02:20:03,240 --> 02:20:04,020
keep going there

2393
02:20:04,050 --> 02:20:05,880
John C Dvorak: I think is
terrific.

2394
02:20:07,290 --> 02:20:10,530
Adam Curry: You're just sucking
up to the trolls. Follow Adam

2395
02:20:10,530 --> 02:20:14,160
will follow to follow John C.
Dvorak had no agenda social.com

2396
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:15,420
Posting memes He loves them.

2397
02:20:15,480 --> 02:20:17,790
John C Dvorak: He go follow I
also follow the real DeVore I

2398
02:20:17,790 --> 02:20:23,190
could Twitter please. Oh, I'm
down like, like the 1000 people.

2399
02:20:23,220 --> 02:20:26,970
Adam Curry: Oh no. That was
that's probably the real the

2400
02:20:26,970 --> 02:20:28,980
actual real people that followed
you

2401
02:20:29,640 --> 02:20:32,610
John C Dvorak: know, it's hard
to say. There's a lot of new

2402
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:38,880
probably write it write this up
on substack there's a lot of new

2403
02:20:38,910 --> 02:20:41,880
types of fake accounts.

2404
02:20:43,500 --> 02:20:45,000
Adam Curry: I love that. I'm
just looking at the troll room.

2405
02:20:46,260 --> 02:20:51,000
Adam takes memes too seriously?
No, I don't. I'm just sour on

2406
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:52,800
social media in general. He

2407
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:56,910
John C Dvorak: sour sour don't
even put anything about it.

2408
02:20:56,970 --> 02:20:59,940
Adam Curry: Um, so our um, sour
What can I tell you?

2409
02:20:59,970 --> 02:21:02,400
John C Dvorak: I'm just sour.
Sour is from living in

2410
02:21:02,400 --> 02:21:03,390
Fredericksburg.

2411
02:21:03,420 --> 02:21:05,670
Adam Curry: Oh man. This
Fredericksburg is the best. What

2412
02:21:05,670 --> 02:21:10,020
are you talking about? See, I
know what you like you liked it

2413
02:21:10,020 --> 02:21:13,770
when I was divorced and
freewheeling and smoking weed

2414
02:21:13,770 --> 02:21:17,040
and all crazy. That's what you
liked. That's Adam. You like

2415
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:21,150
Well, I'm sorry that Adam is no
longer here. I'm just you.

2416
02:21:21,420 --> 02:21:25,950
John C Dvorak: Adam was short
lived. And you were so mean not

2417
02:21:25,950 --> 02:21:28,980
too worried prior but that's
beside the point. But free

2418
02:21:28,980 --> 02:21:33,960
wheeling out there. Getting you
know, finding girls left and

2419
02:21:33,960 --> 02:21:34,320
right.

2420
02:21:36,120 --> 02:21:41,430
Adam Curry: Finding girls Hey.
Yeah, how many? How many did I

2421
02:21:41,430 --> 02:21:51,360
really find 10. Okay. Oh
goodness. So I just want to

2422
02:21:51,360 --> 02:21:54,030
continue thanking everybody
who's a part of no agenda nation

2423
02:21:54,060 --> 02:21:56,400
now which is all of the
producers of course, but we do

2424
02:21:56,400 --> 02:21:59,520
have so many people who have
participated specifically in the

2425
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:03,210
time talent and treasure. We
have no agenda artwork generator

2426
02:22:03,210 --> 02:22:07,680
we have the no agenda meetups we
have Gitmo list that lists all

2427
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:12,240
the all the so many different
websites the no agenda agenda

2428
02:22:12,240 --> 02:22:16,530
shop, no agenda shop, I mean,
this, it really has made no

2429
02:22:16,530 --> 02:22:19,950
agenda nation what it is today.
And I want you to take that

2430
02:22:19,950 --> 02:22:23,490
seriously. The time talent
treasure is real, that there's

2431
02:22:23,490 --> 02:22:27,450
no way we could come anywhere
near what we're doing without

2432
02:22:27,510 --> 02:22:35,160
without that selfless return of
value. And along with that comes

2433
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:37,950
treasure as well. But we'll talk
about that in a moment. Because

2434
02:22:37,950 --> 02:22:41,220
people have just been so
gracious helping us throughout

2435
02:22:41,220 --> 02:22:45,390
all the all these years. Making
it possible. I think when When

2436
02:22:45,390 --> 02:22:48,360
did I really? When did we really
go full time? Was it around

2437
02:22:48,360 --> 02:22:54,210
episode? 200 I think

2438
02:22:54,750 --> 02:23:01,770
John C Dvorak: no. Way before
that. Was it it? It was sub 100?

2439
02:23:02,670 --> 02:23:06,750
Adam Curry: No, it wasn't sub
100? No, I think so. No, because

2440
02:23:06,750 --> 02:23:07,410
100 I was

2441
02:23:07,740 --> 02:23:09,240
John C Dvorak: fine. It was a
big deal, because that's what we

2442
02:23:09,240 --> 02:23:12,840
had to do club and the deuce
club. Really, it was a very

2443
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:17,010
successful promotion. It was
like the most success promotion

2444
02:23:17,010 --> 02:23:22,770
we had and continue to be such,
probably for another three or

2445
02:23:22,770 --> 02:23:28,770
400 shows. We had the art to
deuce club art people join the

2446
02:23:28,770 --> 02:23:29,730
deuce club.

2447
02:23:30,210 --> 02:23:34,890
Adam Curry: Yeah. Yeah, the
deuce Club was Big. Huge was

2448
02:23:34,890 --> 02:23:38,340
huge. What was the was the one
episode that we keep? We kept

2449
02:23:38,370 --> 02:23:41,760
repeating is that the one 100.5?

2450
02:23:42,540 --> 02:23:46,170
John C Dvorak: I can't remember.
It's it's we kept just Yes, we

2451
02:23:46,170 --> 02:23:49,260
did a retrospective I can't
remember the number

2452
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:54,000
retrospective show that we kept
repeating with layers and

2453
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:57,930
layers, have more retrospection
until we kind of ran out of room

2454
02:23:57,930 --> 02:24:00,270
and this thing is floating
around. So I can't remember what

2455
02:24:00,270 --> 02:24:04,350
the show number is. Somebody in
the troll room will know exactly

2456
02:24:04,350 --> 02:24:08,640
what the show number is. Yeah, I
think we did the last one about

2457
02:24:08,640 --> 02:24:14,970
four years ago. And I wanted to
do another one but I think the

2458
02:24:14,970 --> 02:24:17,460
last one covered it covered it
all. I don't know. We can talk

2459
02:24:17,490 --> 02:24:20,490
much more about how we got the
jingles and how we went from

2460
02:24:20,490 --> 02:24:23,670
here to there and how who's
winning the but

2461
02:24:24,509 --> 02:24:28,229
Adam Curry: we need to but yeah,
that's right. I mean, do we even

2462
02:24:28,229 --> 02:24:30,629
need to do that anymore? We we
haven't done that in a while. I

2463
02:24:30,629 --> 02:24:32,909
don't know if we ever need to do
it again. Honestly.

2464
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:35,880
John C Dvorak: No, I think that
one episode does the trick.

2465
02:24:36,420 --> 02:24:38,040
Yeah, yeah, it does.

2466
02:24:38,130 --> 02:24:43,500
Adam Curry: It does. So, I mean,
really, there's just too many

2467
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:45,780
people to thank that. That's
that's the real problem. There's

2468
02:24:45,780 --> 02:24:49,230
too many people to thank for all
of the time and talent you've

2469
02:24:49,230 --> 02:24:55,170
put into it. But we do always
like to thank our artist. As we

2470
02:24:55,170 --> 02:24:58,350
have noted, an Art Generator
where artists upload art

2471
02:24:59,430 --> 02:25:03,150
sometimes Time's in droves just
amazing amounts I think every

2472
02:25:03,150 --> 02:25:06,840
show we have at least 10 pieces
to choose from if not more. So

2473
02:25:06,840 --> 02:25:11,790
we want to thank Matt boy there
I got an education blog where

2474
02:25:11,820 --> 02:25:16,950
I'm sorry blog air blog web it's
you spell it Boisvert but it's

2475
02:25:16,980 --> 02:25:21,870
Bob air is the Arleigh francais.
Matt. For the artwork for

2476
02:25:21,870 --> 02:25:25,290
episode 1599 We titled that one
drop the drop the OP

2477
02:25:27,510 --> 02:25:28,530
John C Dvorak: This is enough

2478
02:25:29,220 --> 02:25:32,370
Adam Curry: another uncovered
Yeah, we got a jingle for it

2479
02:25:32,370 --> 02:25:35,970
too. Now, this was an
interesting piece because I

2480
02:25:35,970 --> 02:25:40,020
don't think either of us noticed
when we first saw this. Israel,

2481
02:25:40,020 --> 02:25:44,940
Ukraine Hamas and NATO with the
IR and n of each of those

2482
02:25:44,940 --> 02:25:49,260
highlighted that Hamas was
misspelled. Di Yeah,

2483
02:25:49,320 --> 02:25:50,880
John C Dvorak: I'm noticing it
now. And I

2484
02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:54,690
Adam Curry: wonder if like Hamas
did that. Well, that's that's

2485
02:25:54,690 --> 02:25:56,670
what a lot of people thought
it's like, oh, wait a minute.

2486
02:25:56,670 --> 02:26:01,920
Was this a subtle dig at Hamas
by by putting to me love Hamas?

2487
02:26:03,450 --> 02:26:04,590
We do love Hamas.

2488
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:07,560
John C Dvorak: Everybody loves
Hamas. If they've, you know, how

2489
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:10,530
could you especially if you've
ever been to the Middle East,

2490
02:26:11,010 --> 02:26:14,010
where the old lady's go in the
basement. You always told this,

2491
02:26:14,190 --> 02:26:17,190
y'all. There's a couple old moms
down the basement grinding the

2492
02:26:17,190 --> 02:26:20,490
beans down, you know with a
pestle and they do it by hand

2493
02:26:20,490 --> 02:26:24,090
and the stuff is so peanut
butter, butter. creamy, smooth.

2494
02:26:24,090 --> 02:26:26,160
It's astonishing. It's good.
It's

2495
02:26:26,160 --> 02:26:29,190
Adam Curry: good. It's good.
Holy mackerel. Have you seen how

2496
02:26:29,190 --> 02:26:31,560
many pieces of art have been
submitted for today's show?

2497
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:36,840
Quite a few. Wow. Well, let's
see what else there was. Dave

2498
02:26:36,840 --> 02:26:40,050
Jackson, you can fast forward
now. Dave Jackson says he hates

2499
02:26:40,050 --> 02:26:42,300
the art segment. For summary. He
listened to the donation

2500
02:26:42,300 --> 02:26:43,710
segment, but he hates the art.
So

2501
02:26:43,710 --> 02:26:45,690
John C Dvorak: he's going to
miss my story about how he got

2502
02:26:45,690 --> 02:26:48,330
to the PhD certificate diploma.

2503
02:26:48,539 --> 02:26:51,839
Adam Curry: This too. He's
already gone. So that's too bad.

2504
02:26:51,839 --> 02:26:56,219
First let's talk about the
options we had. We had none.

2505
02:26:56,369 --> 02:27:02,579
Well, I liked the spread inator
Yeah, you did by scaring. I kind

2506
02:27:02,579 --> 02:27:05,339
of like the spread nature we use
spread inator as the opening

2507
02:27:05,339 --> 02:27:10,409
clip though, which kind of audio
removes it from ruined. Ruined

2508
02:27:10,409 --> 02:27:16,829
did see. Was there anything else
that we liked

2509
02:27:16,860 --> 02:27:19,440
John C Dvorak: whether choose
lies which is spread Nadir was

2510
02:27:19,440 --> 02:27:20,850
the other? Okay, that one?

2511
02:27:22,110 --> 02:27:24,600
Adam Curry: I thought the red
yarn was okay though. Yeah, you

2512
02:27:24,600 --> 02:27:25,410
were onto the red

2513
02:27:25,410 --> 02:27:27,810
John C Dvorak: yarn. I thought
it was too boring.

2514
02:27:29,460 --> 02:27:34,230
Adam Curry: Well, yeah, I mean,
we both just agreed on on the

2515
02:27:34,260 --> 02:27:34,740
deficit of

2516
02:27:34,740 --> 02:27:37,230
John C Dvorak: fall back dos
that it was a fall back

2517
02:27:37,230 --> 02:27:38,010

2592
02:31:42,840 --> 02:31:44,910
John C Dvorak: been a POC, where

02:31:48,180 --> 02:31:49,890
English he there's no doctor.

2595
02:31:50,369 --> 02:31:55,859
Adam Curry: It's a real PhD of a
real subjects philosophy. Yeah.

2596
02:31:56,069 --> 02:31:57,149
Ah, okay. So

2597
02:31:57,180 --> 02:31:59,520
John C Dvorak: now I have to
tell the story. I

2598
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:03,060
Adam Curry: saw the certificate
by the way, dynamite. I mean, it

2599
02:32:03,090 --> 02:32:04,470
I'm putting mine on my wall.

2600
02:32:06,030 --> 02:32:07,170
John C Dvorak: I'm putting mine
on my

2601
02:32:07,170 --> 02:32:09,300
Adam Curry: wall. Does it come
with a frame? Is it framed or

2602
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:09,750
No, no,

2603
02:32:09,750 --> 02:32:13,140
John C Dvorak: it come now you
get your own damn frame. So get

2604
02:32:13,140 --> 02:32:17,610
your own damn frame. So I have
to tell the story about how I

2605
02:32:17,610 --> 02:32:22,710
came to this. Doing this idea as
an idea. It goes back to when I

2606
02:32:22,710 --> 02:32:28,170
was in college. I was a freshman
at Berkeley. And a friend of

2607
02:32:28,170 --> 02:32:32,190
mine and myself during the early
days of the Universal Life

2608
02:32:32,190 --> 02:32:35,670
Church. We actually got a hold
of Kirby Hensley.

2609
02:32:35,730 --> 02:32:39,030
Adam Curry: Yes, I have a huge
I'm a minister of the Universal

2610
02:32:39,030 --> 02:32:40,500
Life Church. I have one of
those.

2611
02:32:40,590 --> 02:32:43,140
John C Dvorak: But almost
everybody is I think there's 14

2612
02:32:43,140 --> 02:32:49,050
million or something like that a
huge number. And so we went to

2613
02:32:49,050 --> 02:32:53,190
it. This is the early days. So
we went to his house in Modesto.

2614
02:32:54,030 --> 02:32:58,890
It was we me and Andrew hood.
The my partner in crime he was

2615
02:32:58,890 --> 02:33:03,570
also a student at Cal is Andrew
still alive? Yeah, I don't know

2616
02:33:03,570 --> 02:33:06,420
where he is. Yeah, he doesn't
listen to the show. Okay, he

2617
02:33:06,420 --> 02:33:12,240
would have said some. So we go
to Modesto. He Kirby lived in a

2618
02:33:12,240 --> 02:33:16,620
little cottage kind of a farm
house and just an attract not a

2619
02:33:16,620 --> 02:33:21,120
tract of houses, but like on
some acreage. And so he went in

2620
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:24,180
there and chatted with him. And
he told us what he was up to.

2621
02:33:24,180 --> 02:33:28,770
And so before I give give his
little spiel of the story, I

2622
02:33:28,770 --> 02:33:32,610
looked up the Wikipedia page on
the Universal Life Church and

2623
02:33:32,610 --> 02:33:38,520
Hensley. Unbelievable bullcrap.
So, you're gonna get the real

2624
02:33:38,520 --> 02:33:39,060
story here.

2625
02:33:39,090 --> 02:33:43,170
Adam Curry: But but the general
idea is, and this is why I got

2626
02:33:43,170 --> 02:33:48,180
my minister of the Universal
Life Church. It is, it is a

2627
02:33:48,180 --> 02:33:51,930
title that is so official, even
though it's just basically you,

2628
02:33:51,960 --> 02:33:56,040
you send the guy money, and he
sends back this ordain

2629
02:33:56,040 --> 02:34:00,300
certificate that I was able to
perform weddings. Yeah, I've

2630
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:06,570
done it legally in as a top 40
DJ trick. I'm gonna do a mass

2631
02:34:06,570 --> 02:34:07,020
wedding.

2632
02:34:08,040 --> 02:34:10,590
John C Dvorak: It's a great bit
it's legal in all the states

2633
02:34:10,590 --> 02:34:16,440
except Virginia. Make note
interesting. So anyway, so we

2634
02:34:16,440 --> 02:34:20,310
went in there and we got to we
got our you know, our ministers

2635
02:34:20,310 --> 02:34:22,500
certificates and then he
mentioned you, would you like a

2636
02:34:22,500 --> 02:34:27,660
Doctor of Divinity? And I said,
Oh, yeah. Now in the in the new

2637
02:34:27,660 --> 02:34:31,650
in the wiki pages says you have
to get a bunch of training to be

2638
02:34:31,650 --> 02:34:34,320
how to start a church. Now. He
just gave us a couple of doctors

2639
02:34:34,320 --> 02:34:38,190
of divinity. Now, a couple of
things to note. One, he said he

2640
02:34:38,190 --> 02:34:42,240
was illiterate couldn't read,
but memorize the Bible by having

2641
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:45,210
it read to him and he was a
Baptist minister. Oh, I didn't

2642
02:34:45,210 --> 02:34:48,630
know the reason he started. The
Universal Life Church, according

2643
02:34:48,630 --> 02:34:54,270
to him at the time, was very
similar to L. Ron Hubbard story,

2644
02:34:54,450 --> 02:34:59,670
which is that the government
taxes he thought it was a gyp

2645
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:03,360
that, that these churches were
you are getting away with not

2646
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:06,060
having to pay taxes and he
thought anyone who starts just a

2647
02:35:06,090 --> 02:35:10,140
one man church should be able to
not pay taxes. And that was the

2648
02:35:10,140 --> 02:35:13,950
whole reason for starting this.
He had some grudge against the

2649
02:35:13,950 --> 02:35:18,600
tax man. That is not what is
told in the wiki page. It's more

2650
02:35:18,600 --> 02:35:24,150
of all love and light. Just a
bunch of bullcrap story now and

2651
02:35:24,150 --> 02:35:27,570
it was kind of an interesting,
irascible guy was really a funny

2652
02:35:27,570 --> 02:35:28,560
guy, Alabama

2653
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:30,000
Adam Curry: he'd become rich off
of this.

2654
02:35:30,420 --> 02:35:32,610
John C Dvorak: I don't know if
he did. He didn't seem like he

2655
02:35:32,610 --> 02:35:37,140
cared. He wasn't one of those
guys. He was just a nice guy.

2656
02:35:37,710 --> 02:35:43,770
very personable Alabama slight
accent. And so we're leaving and

2657
02:35:43,770 --> 02:35:48,420
this is what, to this day, the
sticks in my craw. And I don't

2658
02:35:48,420 --> 02:35:51,540
think they do this anymore. But
at the time, as we're two of us

2659
02:35:51,540 --> 02:35:55,470
really. We had a nice chat with
him. Probably an hour. And he

2660
02:35:55,470 --> 02:36:03,360
says, Hey, do you want a PhD?
And we're leaving and I said it

2661
02:36:03,360 --> 02:36:05,670
because I got the doctorate
divinity. I think that's pretty

2662
02:36:05,670 --> 02:36:08,550
cool. So then I said no,

2663
02:36:08,580 --> 02:36:11,190
Adam Curry: oh, no. And this is
your way of getting back at your

2664
02:36:11,190 --> 02:36:13,200
horrible faux pa your canard.

2665
02:36:13,710 --> 02:36:16,500
John C Dvorak: It was a complete
blunder looking back on it. I

2666
02:36:16,500 --> 02:36:19,770
don't even know if they do the
PhDs anymore. But he said, he

2667
02:36:19,770 --> 02:36:22,050
says you want a PhD? I'll give
it to you anything you want.

2668
02:36:22,620 --> 02:36:27,660
Adam Curry: Wow. Wow. No, no,
no.

2669
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:30,120
John C Dvorak: So this has been
galling me forever. So I said

2670
02:36:30,120 --> 02:36:31,140
hell with it. We're gonna do it.

2671
02:36:32,700 --> 02:36:35,760
Adam Curry: All right. And this
is a promotion that lasts how

2672
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:37,290
long? I think we're

2673
02:36:37,290 --> 02:36:39,300
John C Dvorak: gonna do it

2674
02:36:39,300 --> 02:36:42,600

02:36:42,630 --> 02:36:44,820

2680
02:36:58,560 --> 02:37:01,230

02:37:01,230 --> 02:37:05,100
one foot away it looks like and
it's got to seal that whole

2682
02:37:05,100 --> 02:37:07,710

2687
02:37:19,920 --> 02:37:23,640
John C Dvorak: Well, so those
are just a donation of $1,000 or

2688
02:37:23,640 --> 02:37:27,030
more. It can be added to
anything else you're doing. But

2689
02:37:27,030 --> 02:37:30,120
it's it can't be like you know,
you it's not an additive thing.

2690
02:37:30,150 --> 02:37:33,270
You know, you pay 10 bucks a
month for five years and get it?

2691
02:37:33,660 --> 02:37:36,540
Adam Curry: No, no. Typically,
you'd have to pay $50,000 per

2692
02:37:36,540 --> 02:37:37,620
year for four years.

2693
02:37:38,310 --> 02:37:40,020
John C Dvorak: Yeah, yeah, we're
saving money.

2694
02:37:41,400 --> 02:37:44,670

executive producers and Knights

2695
02:37:44,670 --> 02:37:48,120

episode 1600 with a lot of show

2696
02:37:48,120 --> 02:37:51,270
number donations. As John
alluded to Jonathan Poehler is

2697
02:37:51,270 --> 02:37:54,720
from Coors Ville, Virginia. Hey,
he can't be a minister of the

2698
02:37:54,720 --> 02:37:57,270
Universal Life Church. Sorry.
Well, you can but you just can't

2699
02:37:57,270 --> 02:38:00,840
marry anyone in Virginia. And he
says first heard Adam on Tom

2700
02:38:00,840 --> 02:38:06,180

my full conversion finally took

2701
02:38:06,180 --> 02:38:10,410

2022. With little help from my

2702
02:38:10,410 --> 02:38:15,900
friend, Chris some time. I'd
love to hear the full Adam dog

2703
02:38:15,900 --> 02:38:19,650
walking song. Well, I don't
think we really have time to

2704
02:38:19,650 --> 02:38:24,480
play to play. There wasn't a dog
walking. What was that about? I

2705
02:38:24,480 --> 02:38:31,320
can't remember dog walking now.
I think it was. Was that trapped

2706
02:38:31,320 --> 02:38:36,510

way too many eggs.com it sir

he'd like to eat his connais

2709

2710
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:55,710
John C Dvorak: Cantlay is a
board dough desert at his killer

2711
02:38:55,710 --> 02:38:57,600

how to make them read. They're

2712
02:38:57,600 --> 02:39:03,480
kind of they have to be made in
a copper pan is that they're

2713
02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:05,550
cute little things you've
probably had when you don't even

02:39:05,550 --> 02:39:08,580
Adam Curry: know them on fire.
Do you put them on fire? No.

2715
02:39:09,210 --> 02:39:12,390
Okay, and with that he wants a
small glass of colostrum.

02:39:12,630 --> 02:39:13,710
John C Dvorak: Oh pool.

2717
02:39:15,210 --> 02:39:16,590
Adam Curry: What is colostrum?

2718
02:39:16,860 --> 02:39:19,110
John C Dvorak: Just a goop that
comes out of a woman after she

2719
02:39:19,110 --> 02:39:20,670
gives birth. Oh.

2720
02:39:23,940 --> 02:39:28,980

That's Adam quit I quit nice. I

2857
02:49:03,180 --> 02:49:07,440
think the 45,000 hours of no
agenda education you to have

2858
02:49:07,440 --> 02:49:11,490
produced is more than worthy of
a PhD degree. I don't think that

2859
02:49:11,490 --> 02:49:14,730
would be proud to be known as
Sir Skyride. Doctor of media

2860
02:49:14,730 --> 02:49:16,620

2861
02:49:17,070 --> 02:49:24,540

think it's 45,000 maybe 4500

2865
02:49:37,560 --> 02:49:39,600

02:50:31,350 --> 02:50:33,450
John C Dvorak: I don't know I'd
like to know what link he

2883
02:50:33,450 --> 02:50:37,380
clicked to donate this money
because it's one of the links

2884
02:50:37,380 --> 02:50:42,630
that hooks to the to the old
legacy account so he sent his

2885
02:50:42,630 --> 02:50:45,420
note and Jay sent me know saying
do I always have a record of

2886

know how you get there from

2888
02:50:51,150 --> 02:50:51,390
here.

2889
02:50:51,420 --> 02:50:54,120
Adam Curry: Maybe he still just
has that legacy account in his

02:50:54,120 --> 02:50:55,890
PayPal. It hangs around

2891
02:50:56,850 --> 02:50:58,860
John C Dvorak: you might
something like that does go on

2892
02:50:58,860 --> 02:51:00,870
but it's just mystifies me

2893
02:51:00,990 --> 02:51:03,840
Adam Curry: Yeah. And so we're
still honoring this for so so

2894

Canada Naviance can now become a
PhD on the cheap

2895
02:51:07,260 --> 02:51:10,770
John C Dvorak: well this was a
little gotcha that he brought up

2896
02:51:11,640 --> 02:51:17,040

the idea I couldn't but no we

the count these these monies for

from work. It's highly enjoyable
and definitely helped me keep a

2941
02:54:09,510 --> 02:54:12,870
grip on what Saturday I had left
during the pandemic. And then he

2942
02:54:12,870 --> 02:54:15,540
says he has a funny story about
Glenn Beck which is I did read

2943
02:54:15,540 --> 02:54:18,360
this. My lovely wife and I went
to an And Then There Were None

2944
02:54:18,360 --> 02:54:20,850

got VIP access. Glenn walked in

2948
02:54:31,170 --> 02:54:33,630
saw me smiled like we hadn't
seen each other for a while,

2949
02:54:33,690 --> 02:54:37,440
walked right up, shook my hand
and I said hi Glenn. Really easy

02:54:37,440 --> 02:54:40,710
like I knew he'd come up to me
and he said hi back smiling.

2951
02:54:40,710 --> 02:54:44,220
Then I said not a joke. I give
my word as a non Biden. I said,

2952
02:54:44,550 --> 02:54:47,520

done or handled.

connection. It will give you

protection and you can calm down
calm down. Calm down. Look at

3461
03:27:59,670 --> 03:28:02,580
some people look at them in the
face. Look at their facial

3462
03:28:02,580 --> 03:28:05,790
expressions. You'll feel good
about it. No agenda meetup.com

3463
03:28:05,790 --> 03:28:09,330
If you can't find one near you,
then please start one yourself.

3464
03:28:09,330 --> 03:28:20,190
It's easy. Sometimes you go hang
out with Bom Bom you won't be

3465
03:28:20,280 --> 03:28:30,510
triggered everybody feels the
same. It's like a party like a

3466
03:28:30,510 --> 03:28:33,840
party people. It's just like a
party. It's trust me. It's like

3467
03:28:33,840 --> 03:28:34,440
a party.

3468
03:28:35,039 --> 03:28:40,889
John C Dvorak: It's almost like
a party. Do you have an idea for

3469
03:28:40,889 --> 03:28:41,519
a shows?

3470
03:28:41,730 --> 03:28:44,730
Adam Curry: I think I got a
couple of good ones actually. I

3471
03:28:44,730 --> 03:28:49,560
think a is it do I start? Is
that the Yeah, it was

3472
03:28:49,590 --> 03:28:50,880
John C Dvorak: mites are less
sensitive.

3473
03:28:50,880 --> 03:28:54,390
Adam Curry: dealio Okay, do it
for your penis. All right,

3474
03:28:54,420 --> 03:28:54,780
that's

3475
03:28:55,530 --> 03:28:56,310
John C Dvorak: nuts out.

3476
03:28:57,690 --> 03:29:06,150
Adam Curry: I am not woke. Mm
hmm. This feels good. Huh. And

3477
03:29:06,150 --> 03:29:09,060
this This is this is I think the
kicker? What does this have

3478
03:29:09,060 --> 03:29:10,470
Unknown: to do with podcasting?

3479
03:29:11,220 --> 03:29:13,260
John C Dvorak: Come on. I liked
that one. But I don't think I

3480
03:29:13,260 --> 03:29:15,780
think that I think it should be
more about the show.

3481
03:29:15,930 --> 03:29:17,700
Adam Curry: Well, that's why
like, what does this have to do

3482
03:29:17,700 --> 03:29:19,890
about the podcast? And that's
why I thought it was a good one.

3483
03:29:20,250 --> 03:29:22,380
John C Dvorak: Okay, well, I
have one about the show that I'm

3484
03:29:22,380 --> 03:29:25,440
not gonna skip the stupid one
because there's no good anyway.

3485
03:29:26,340 --> 03:29:29,340
But I think try generations.

3486
03:29:30,060 --> 03:29:33,870
Adam Curry: generations will not
forget. Hmm, okay.

3487
03:29:34,680 --> 03:29:37,410
John C Dvorak: Okay, well, then
here's one that refers to the

3488
03:29:37,410 --> 03:29:39,660
show. Not going.

3489
03:29:40,470 --> 03:29:44,970
Adam Curry: And we are not going
anywhere. Yeah, that's not bad.

3490
03:29:44,970 --> 03:29:45,630
Yeah.

3491
03:29:46,680 --> 03:29:48,930
John C Dvorak: And then the last
one is just because this show is

3492
03:29:48,930 --> 03:29:53,280
long and it's show 1600 Just a
round of applause.

3493
03:29:58,470 --> 03:30:01,890
Adam Curry: This has a real
please Clap vibe. I think not

3494
03:30:01,890 --> 03:30:03,450
going anywhere is pretty good.

3495
03:30:06,180 --> 03:30:07,050
John C Dvorak: Yeah, I do do

3496
03:30:07,080 --> 03:30:08,820
Adam Curry: I think I think
that's I think that's the winner

3497
03:30:08,820 --> 03:30:12,060
right there. That's the winner.
The winner

3498
03:30:12,210 --> 03:30:13,290
John C Dvorak: because we're not
going anywhere.

3499
03:30:13,320 --> 03:30:14,460
Adam Curry: We're not going
anywhere people.

3500
03:30:14,520 --> 03:30:16,500
John C Dvorak: I know we're
gonna be here on Sunday.

3501
03:30:16,530 --> 03:30:19,860
Adam Curry: Yes. Do you? Do you
have one last clip you want to

3502
03:30:19,860 --> 03:30:20,610
play? I do

3503
03:30:20,610 --> 03:30:22,740
John C Dvorak: have one less
clip which is interesting. It's

3504
03:30:22,740 --> 03:30:26,610
a suit to Dan update. So it
keeps us on Africa clip if you

3505
03:30:26,610 --> 03:30:29,790
haven't noticed. last clip of
the show six months

03:30:29,790 --> 03:30:32,700
Unknown: of war in Sudan have
plunged the country into one of

3507
03:30:32,700 --> 03:30:35,190
the worst humanitarian
nightmares in recent history,

3508
03:30:35,190 --> 03:30:38,910
killing up to 9000 people and
displacing over 5 million. That

3509
03:30:38,910 --> 03:30:42,030
was the stark warning issued by
the United Nations which said at

3510
03:30:42,030 --> 03:30:45,240
least 25 million people in Sudan
are also in need of urgent

3511
03:30:45,240 --> 03:30:48,510
humanitarian relief.
Humanitarian Aid Relief has been

3512
03:30:48,510 --> 03:30:51,270
hindered by violence between the
Sudanese army and the rapid

3513
03:30:51,270 --> 03:30:54,090
support forces since fighting
broke out in April. The

3514
03:30:54,090 --> 03:30:57,930
healthcare situation is also
dire. As many medical facilities

3515
03:30:57,930 --> 03:31:00,870
and conflict areas have been
shuttered. Human rights groups

3516
03:31:00,870 --> 03:31:03,150
have condemned the ongoing
targeting and killing of

3517
03:31:03,150 --> 03:31:06,000
civilians and journalists. That
Committee to Protect Journalists

3518
03:31:06,000 --> 03:31:08,940
is demanding an investigation
into the October 10 killing of

Sudanese journalist Halima Idris
Salim, who died after RSF

end the show on a high note by

3523
03:31:23,640 --> 03:31:27,720
someone getting run over that's
really nice and is it Sudan or

please rise for your demo nation

3554
03:33:33,180 --> 03:33:50,430
My name is Mo we are to be human
resources as in all lands from

3555
03:33:50,430 --> 03:33:59,160
the east to the west down the
land we

3556
03:34:11,610 --> 03:34:16,560
ready we are united and that's
what we did we stayed United

3557
03:34:18,660 --> 03:34:21,810
Adam Curry: American government
spend more money

3558
03:34:24,960 --> 03:34:27,990
Unknown: it matters. I'll be
honest with you, as always

3559
03:34:27,990 --> 03:34:31,770
promised every day all supply
and justify you agree with the

3560
03:34:31,770 --> 03:34:37,350
vote falsify. And justify for
years to come. All Americans

3561
03:34:37,740 --> 03:34:41,640
have repeatedly shown that they
will not tolerate anyone who

3562
03:34:41,640 --> 03:34:44,880
tries to take your country
backwards. We're going to be

3563
03:34:44,880 --> 03:34:51,540
okay. I call it Building a
Better America. By no news about

3564
03:34:51,540 --> 03:34:54,750
what's happening can seem
alarming to all Americans. But

3565
03:34:54,750 --> 03:34:59,970
the next few days, weeks and
months will be hard on my watch

3566
03:35:00,000 --> 03:35:04,470
To know whether we're going to
be okay. In the history of this

3567
03:35:04,470 --> 03:35:08,280
era is when America will be
weaker and the rest of the world

3568
03:35:08,280 --> 03:35:13,440
stronger. Everyone from students
to retirees to teachers proud

3569
03:35:13,440 --> 03:35:16,800
proud people pound for pound
ready to fight with every inch

3570
03:35:16,800 --> 03:35:22,140
of earners do they have this is
a real test is gonna take time.

3571
03:35:24,060 --> 03:35:26,880
It hasn't worked for working
people in this nation for too

3572
03:35:26,880 --> 03:35:29,220
long. All across America.

3573
03:35:31,590 --> 03:35:33,570
John C Dvorak: I get it. It's
one of

3574
03:35:33,570 --> 03:35:36,000
Unknown: my top priorities
getting Americans under control

3575
03:35:36,840 --> 03:35:42,120
and throughout our history to
cause more chaos. Every

3576
03:35:42,120 --> 03:35:45,780
administration says they'll do
it. Now everyone sees it

3577
03:35:45,780 --> 03:35:51,600
clearly. I really need to think
about this moment that our

3578
03:35:51,600 --> 03:35:58,140
character this generation has
formed purposes. A futures for

3579
03:36:01,260 --> 03:36:08,880
America as we stand ready to do
more if necessary. Think about

3580
03:36:12,270 --> 03:36:16,050
not looking to punish anybody.
All Americans have repeatedly

3581
03:36:16,050 --> 03:36:19,620
shown that they will not
tolerate anyone who tries to

3582
03:36:19,620 --> 03:36:23,580
take their country backwards.
That's great. And I agree. Oh,

3583
03:36:23,580 --> 03:36:23,700
what

3584
03:36:23,700 --> 03:36:24,870
Adam Curry: are you drinking?
John? What are you drinking?

3585
03:36:24,870 --> 03:36:26,370
What are you drinking? What are
you drinking? What are you

3586
03:36:26,370 --> 03:36:28,950
drinking? What are you drinking?
What are we drinking today?

3587
03:36:29,070 --> 03:36:32,580
John C Dvorak: Today's beverage
of choices. My last bottle of

3588
03:36:32,610 --> 03:36:37,530
Topo G Joe Pellegrino is
cinsaut. Just plain old polar

3589
03:36:37,560 --> 03:36:41,730
Okay, his polar unflavored
natural seltzer. Seltzer,

3590
03:36:41,760 --> 03:36:43,380
Unknown: Seltzer, seltzer.

3591
03:36:43,620 --> 03:36:46,950
John C Dvorak: Seltzer is
sparkling water and unfiltered

3592
03:36:46,950 --> 03:36:49,560
sparkling water with
electrolytes

3593
03:36:49,620 --> 03:36:52,560
Adam Curry: I'll take the opium
and warm orange juice please

3594
03:36:52,590 --> 03:36:55,290
John C Dvorak: I really like low
