1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,670
John: 1000 attorneys say Trump sucks.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:03,900
Unknown: Adam Curry,

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,410
John Dvorak.

4
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:24,150
Adam: It's Thursday, May 14 2020. This is your award winning keto nation media assassination Episode 1200 42. This is no agenda freshly cut hair don't
care and broadcasting live from opportunity zone 33 Austin, Texas capital of the drone stars in the morning, everybody.

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:32,910
John: I'm Adam Curry from Northern Silicon Valley, where we're all wondering Whatever happened to the Ice Bucket Challenge of John Dvorak?

6
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:45,150
Adam: Doubt everybody's wondering what happened to that? Yes, they are. No, that's not true. No, they're not. No one's wondering about that.

7
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,950
John: The money they gave me money got it at some people. Yes.

8
00:00:49,950 --> 00:01:02,760
Adam: That was for ALS. The money went to ALS. Oh, well, I don't know. Man. You should dive into it. I want a full report. I want a full report
Sunday. I want to know all about it.

9
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,669
Unknown: Hey, I had a haircut.

10
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,990
John: And a haircut. It's okay with me.

11
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:14,009
Adam: I'm so happy I had a haircut. It's so nice. But what an experience that

12
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,000
John: you like long here.

13
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:34,470
Adam: No. Well, I did. I mean, well, no, actually, I've never liked it. It just looked good on me at the time back in the day. Remember, I have a
small head in order to work well on TV, you need a big head. So if you don't have a big head is not that small, by the way. It's not as big as Pat's
Ajax. Or Vanna White.

14
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,720
John: Or Little Richard Have you ever seen the size of that guy's head? He had a big head what

15
00:01:39,720 --> 00:02:34,620
Adam: Little Richard was anything but little. He was pretty big. It was pretty big. So learn a little bit about about returning back to work and what
it means when the governor on a Friday afternoon says hey, guess what? You guys with hair salons you can open up on Monday. You don't think about it
as a customer obviously like oh, that's fine. Great. So I immediately This was I think it was Friday I saw the news I immediately started texting
johannah my hairstylist to the stars of Austin and and she said oh my god we weren't ready for this we had no idea we thought the 18th is the last we
heard is the 18th it would you know we would be able to take look and figure out a timeline but all of a sudden they you know they threw it on him in
two days it This was not a smart idea.

16
00:02:35,010 --> 00:03:00,810
John: I've heard about this around the country there's different areas and there's always the hair salons and I was thinking to myself I'm thinking to
myself self self How hard is it to boot a hair salon you got you know you're standing you need your scissors you need to cut it you know a little
buzzing things. You need a bucket of goo for the cooking. So this is no What is it? This

17
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:08,370
Adam: is exactly what can it be this is what I thought or at least the impression I had this a lot first of all what happens is without you

18
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,250
John: knowing and poo go bad or something in the meantime,

19
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:31,410
Adam: wow man, I hope the next person who cuts your hair sticks scissors in your eye. You're a horrible person 345677 cars on these Zephyr Ladies and
gentlemen, we're still in a state of depression. Yep. No. So the first thing that happens is without any knowledge of this would take

20
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,400
John: me with a stick I just scissors in my head is not nice. So I'm

21
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,200
Adam: warning you really because

22
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:48,690
John: you know you get my hairdresser. Care cutter. He He doesn't listen to the show. Nobody listens to the show in that debt business. Like Can I

23
00:03:48,690 --> 00:05:22,290
Adam: just tell you what the what the experience was? So you understand why I think you are wrong about all you need is some glutinous scissors and
some shampoo. Okay, so imagine you're you're it's a Friday night, you don't even know what day it is anymore in the lockdown. And all of a sudden some
someone important says, Oh, yeah, Monday, you can go back to the hairdresser. What do you think happens? They get swept up in order and they're caught
off guard. And there's a lot has to happen. There's, there's, you know, we have very strict city ordinances despite what the governor has ordered. The
city of Austin is going down. We'll get into that in a moment. So you have to have policies and has to be published. You have to let everybody knows
everyone has to wait in the car before they come in. You have to clean off all surfaces. There's a lot of different things that have to take place.
And then the fear. It's not like the whole hair salon wanted to come back. There were other hair cutters. They're like, No, I'm terrified. So can you
open up with half a shop? You know, there's a lot of questions. I didn't think about it, but then when you get into it, it's really weird to have your
hair cut with a mask on and Even even Johanna's, like looking at me like, now I know this sucks so bad, but it's a requirement. not legally, but it's
a requirement. Based on shaming this, let me play these clips, you'll understand we kind of started on this, but when the governor of texas said,

24
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:54,030
Okay, here's what here's what's gonna happen we can open up. There's no requirement for masks in public or eight or even indoors. I mean, it can be up
to the proprietor if they want to force people to wear underwear on their head. But Adler said, Oh, no, no, no, no, we're just gonna tell everyone
they need to wear a mask. I think we had the clip on the last show. And even though I can't find you or send you to jail, knowing that you've killed
somebody should be enough if you don't wear a mask outside all the time and 90 degree heat. So now the Texas attorney general has sent a warning to
Austin and its

25
00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:15,420
Unknown: Mayor at a time when some Austin staples like Shady Grove have closed their doors for good. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent a warning
letter in part to Mayor Steve Adler and Travis County Judge Sarah Eckart saying that the local health orders issued last Friday were confusing and
unlawful because the order doesn't clearly differentiate between recommendations and requirements.

26
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,620
Restaurants fully

27
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,910
support contact Tracy

28
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:40,980
Kelsey Erickson Stratford is with the Texas Restaurant Association. They also sent a letter to Mayor Adler asking him to change section 11 of the
local order. It encourages restaurants with the capacity of 75 or less to keep a log of all customers and employees who came in including the dates
and times they were there and where they sat. Tra says if small businesses are doing this, so should the big ones.

29
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:47,850
Small businesses options are to do this or to be publicly shamed. That's not an option.

30
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,220
We really are treating this like a requirement.

31
00:06:53,250 --> 00:07:21,600
city and county attorneys are now reviewing pakhtuns letter but in a statement to CBS Austin, a Travis County spokesperson said in part our initial
thought is we disagree with the Attorney General Mayor Adler also sent us a statement saying in part up to this point, we have avoided the naked
politicization of the virus crisis. I will not follow the ag down that road. The city's order complements, incorporates and does not conflict with the
governor's orders. Adler also brought it up during his daily virtual address.

32
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,290
We asked

33
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,190
restaurants to do that voluntarily and I guess the

34
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,600
voluntary act.

35
00:07:31,140 --> 00:08:13,140
Adam: So Adler's trying to do a Cuomo every single day from his office there above the W Hotel in downtown Austin. It's I really this guy's been he's
not here, I don't think he's left his home at all. He's the guy this pussy. He's the one that's sitting inside and requiring small businesses in
particular restaurants. We had this happen when we went to the first open, first restaurant opening, you've got to write down your name, you got to
sign a piece of paper. And of course, people are going to revolt against that. And it's not even a requirement by law. But you heard it. It's the
shaming. That's where all of this is headed. One more clip of the response from Adler. Regarding the defiant Austin, Texas,

36
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:51,360
Unknown: your state is opening up but your city is not yet. Why not? Well, we're opening up to the extent that the governor has has has put it in his
order. So we're compliant with the state. But the messaging that we're trying to send to our community is to take this cautiously and slowly, because
no one knows what the impact of this is going to be in. It's going to take us three weeks, maybe four weeks to get the the data on hospitalizations
that we need to see, to see whether or not our toe dip here is putting us on a path to another surge. So it's more

37
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:58,320
Adam: what other serves there was never a surge in Texas to start with. But he feels that there's a surge surge.

38
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:05,280
So it's more of a messaging element than anything else. We have a lot of community members that know that while these things are

39
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,950
Unknown: opening. It doesn't mean we have to go. And it doesn't mean that we that we have to

40
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:25,170
open. The governor has allowed those things to happen. But we are urging our community to take this cautiously and slowly so that we can measure the
impact before we end up with another surge. Another surge

41
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,040
John: he said twice a

42
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:54,690
Adam: week and I checked just to make sure maybe I missed the wording somewhere. There's not even a headline was surge in Texas, Travis County or
Austin. This is about shaming. And I was surprised because I kind of scoffed when you said it. But my hairdresser. She said oh my god, I never Intel.
She's definitely liberal. She says I never expected to see it was kind of funny. This level of social shaming from liberals.

43
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,730
Unknown: I'm like what

44
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,130
what okay.

45
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:09,330
Adam: And she said literally it's very clear if you wear a mask you're a democrat if you don't you're a Republican. It's exactly what you said about
California.

46
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,520
Unknown: exactly what it is.

47
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:20,069
Adam: And and even she recognizes it's only to make you feel good these are the masks are the like the ribbons after 911

48
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:56,760
John: you know, whatever forget what's in that is community. There's also a community aspect to it. I've noticed this when you go around without a
mask in a fight with people mix, some masks, no masks, you can start to see the connection you can see that the no mass people or the you see a lot of
macho guys motorcyclists. It's kind of like that Larry David episode where he wore the trump hat. You just start to see it. And you can see these old
guys are just trying to get to do it. You know, Marie

49
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:10,080
Adam: just gave me a great idea. Oh, here's what you need. Read. Make America Great Again. Masks. Yeah. Hello. This is the perfect

50
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,680
John: perfect funny idea. But there's the mask.

51
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,790
Adam: No. Are you kidding me? I think I think Republicans will wear the mask.

52
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:27,570
John: Or you have to wear the mask to get into the store Whole Foods for example. Yeah. bicted mask. Yeah, great. America. Make America Great Again,
are mega

53
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,430
Adam: mega masks. It's a Mega Man. Where

54
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,130
John: are they? They must have already been Microsoft. Well, we have.

55
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:54,660
Adam: Well, it just came up. And another thing. When I'm watching television, and I'm seeing actors, I'm seeing commercials. They don't represent the
American public anymore. I demand that every single commercial the actors wear masks in the commercial. I'm looking at masks all day. And I come home
and all I see is faces Ooh, ugly if I put a mask on that.

56
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:24,300
John: Put a mask on it. You know what? I hate? I don't want to be the sexist everyone thinks I am. I don't like that. So there you run into this
situation. And again, I just happened the other day. It's like there's some leggy girl or is it somebody with great legs? This is make it be honest
about all right. And she's got the mask on and then you start seeing you wonder

57
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,080
Adam: you're wondering what what is does the face mat match the rest of the

58
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:35,220
John: great body match the lake or is it an older woman with great legs disease see that everyone would run into that in Florida.

59
00:12:35,670 --> 00:13:00,090
Adam: This is also a godsend for older women because they can have a scar for something like Nancy Pelosi you have a nice you know a scarf that you
have around your neck. You can pull up if you need a mask situation but in the meantime, a women loves hiding their you know if they are unhappy with
their neck that a lot of older women are and so that it's it can work as a fashion statement for them.

60
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:09,330
John: Well, on the topic of these mess, I do have an Amy Goodman clip well before you do that epitomizes Well, I'm sorry.

61
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:39,600
Adam: Well, I have to apologize first. You can't just like well, I made a mistake. I made a mistake on the last show. I made a big deal about the
Fauci clip which was listed as may 6 turns out it was March 6, and and he was clearly saying no mask whatsoever. It's not necessary. It's even dumb.
And right and people got mad at me john may This is why we can't listen anymore coming so obsessed with

62
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,700
John: Rob you got two letters.

63
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,230
Adam: Okay, dude, I get my letters and your mood

64
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,060
John: and your let's be serious. I

65
00:13:51,060 --> 00:14:01,440
Adam: get my letters and your letters so stop with me. I want to play the original then I want to get to Amy cuz I have a Judy and Judy will lead to
Amy that makes a lot I don't

66
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,990
John: know Amy's about the masks. I know. I know

67
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,750
Adam: this is about the mask. This is Fauci on the mask, Judy.

68
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:42,450
John: I saw this that this breakdown of Fauci The thing was labeled. It would when the when the clip went out, and it was criticizing you for playing
this clip and giving a wrong date. There's two things one, it was mislabeled. I saw this. I saw these these clips. They had a mis label on them. They
were labeled May. And the second thing is this is proving that Fauci was a debt into the whole thing early on, and now they're blaming Trump with
quotes, which I have on certain clips, I have a clip saying, oh, and Trump wouldn't listen to Fauci, Fauci was not into this until later.

69
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:52,320
Adam: So here is the original. This is from March, and even though it's an outdated opinion, I don't see how the science of what he's saying changes.

70
00:14:52,860 --> 00:15:36,150
Unknown: Right now in the United States. People should not be walking around with masks. You're sure that because people are listening really cool. To
the right now people should not be worried there's no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a
mask might make people feel a little bit better. And it might even block a droplet. But it's not providing the perfect protection that people think
that it is. And often, there are unintended consequences. People keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face, then can you get some
schmutz is sort of staying inside their horse, of course, but when you think mask, you should think of healthcare providers needing them and people
who are ill.

71
00:15:36,840 --> 00:16:03,720
Adam: So very clear, it sounds to me like he's talking scientifically, this just makes no sense. By the way, have some hair that's cut off your head
fall in, in between your mask and your face. See how that feels is very, very shitty experience. So now we have April 3, so that's still a month ago.
Here's Judy on PBS asking Pope Fauci about the masks again, masks. Oh, by the way, that's my ISO candidate

72
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:19,170
Unknown: masks, we are told that the Trump administration is on the verge of urging Americans to wear masks when they go out. Tell us about the
thinking on that. Because just a few days ago, we were told that the thinking was that was not necessary.

73
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:22,619
John: It's a great question, Judy. And the thinking is I could

74
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,440
Adam: there's no way to edit anything after that great question,

75
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,900
Unknown: that the thinking was that was not necessary?

76
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:50,190
It's a great question, Judy. And the thinking is really now influenced by information that's coming in. And the information is that more and more
accumulation of data indicate that people who are without symptoms at all can transmit the virus. But importantly, they can do it merely by speaking.

77
00:16:50,610 --> 00:17:04,230
Adam: Now this, I'd I want to see this report. I don't know what he's referring to. But now you can transfer it before it was a droplet may be highly
unlikely now, just the force of your voice.

78
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:07,259
Unknown: So there's a shot? Yeah,

79
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:26,340
John: there was I just want to mention that I picked up on this and a couple recent clips. I may even have one of them. I'm not sure. Because I didn't
think I didn't think it was it was a trend. But yet they're saying that talking? Yeah, just talking just goes back to your theory about the mass being
just a muscle, a muscle,

80
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:34,559
Adam: it's a muscle, we, you're talking up? Thank you. It's a good point, just by talking you're you're very dangerous. Yeah,

81
00:17:34,590 --> 00:18:01,770
John: muscle, they can do it merely by speaking. So there's been a recent study that came out that said, even the force from your voice of speaking,
there is a degree of aerosolization. Namely, the virus can come out not very far, a few feet and down. So even though the perfect solution to this is
if everyone at all times could stay six feet separated.

82
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:24,450
Adam: So in all the years in 35 years of, of infectious diseases and viruses. Now all of a sudden, this one is different than all the rest, were just
the force of your voice can go out a few feet and down, and it can kill people. It's just I'm surprised. I'm just surprised times it's a genius virus

83
00:18:24,450 --> 00:19:05,550
John: has ever spoken to an acrobat 11 East fishmarket? No, well, they spit on you stay six feet separated from another person. But as you correctly
mentioned, this is not always feasible. There are times when you have to do necessary functions, you have to get food, you have to get drugs from the
pharmacy. And you might inadvertently be in a situation where you're close enough where that kind of transmission can take place. And importantly, I
think what people don't fully appreciate, is that putting a mask on yourself is more to prevent you from infecting someone else. Alright, so

84
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:15,030
Adam: but it's still not a legal requirement. It's not something you have to do by law. And why? Well, because unfortunately, we can't throw people in
jail.

85
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:26,700
Unknown: And the same question about masks that I was asking about staying at home, if these are things that that save lives, keep people healthy, why
not require them to do this?

86
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:47,550
John: You know, Judy, I understand where you're coming from. But it becomes difficult when you say required by what by penalty by putting people in
jail. I mean, that becomes you know, something that really can be counterproductive in the society that we live in, in America, perhaps you might be
able to do that in China. Difficult to do it here. So

87
00:19:47,939 --> 00:19:59,969
Adam: notice how he says he doesn't say, Well, if you want that kind of crazy, you got to go to China. That's where they force the people to do stuff.
No, he's saying, you got to be China. If you want that. It's just wink wink nudge nudge.

88
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:09,659
Unknown: You might be able to do that in China. But I think it would be difficult to do it here. So what we're relying on is two people to really
understand the importance of this.

89
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:57,899
Adam: Yes. And the importance indeed so after the the hair hairdresser on the way home I'm like, I'm hungry. I'm going to get me a sausage biscuit and
to hash brown at McDonald's in the drive thru. And this was my experience because the order taker who already you know, they have the headset with a
microphone, so she had a mask on she had a mask on I like Could I have a sausage biscuit at what Yeah, I'll have a Dr. Pepper. I just gave up. I said,
I don't know what you're saying. Give me hashbrown

90
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,110
John: Hendry

91
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,820
Adam: Oh my goodness.

92
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,820
John: So that was a good good bit

93
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,420
Adam: but what do you think of this of this isoh masks printer show?

94
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,170
John: I think is boring but I don't have anything to get people with this. Why don't

95
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:23,550
Adam: you have you ever given no standing if you have nothing to compete with? had nothing to tell me my kids boards you guys okay. All right. Let's
see what do you got? What am

96
00:21:23,910 --> 00:22:15,570
John: I this is back to the idea. This is the original idea and I think this is more important than the lot of this especially Trump people in jail
part. Although I do like the bit you should bit of the person wearing a mask and by the way, they're isolated anyway, they're over by themselves the
people that are on the McDonald's microphone, but okay. This is a me talking about a big con fab going on. And there was Trump he had one of these two
with the governor of Nebraska and the governor of Colorado and and just you when they pulled the camera back at two sides of the room that Colorado
Governor's wearing a mask and his assistant was wearing masks on one side and the other side did to demo the republicans from Nebraska word and Amy
notices this elsewhere. And it's it's becoming a thing.

97
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,720
Unknown: Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky

98
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,960
Adam: The fruit is this the one concepts that we want? Because I've

99
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,800
John: tuned What did was read up it says Amy wrap mastics

100
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,700
Adam: because you mentioned concept that's why it's Alright, here we go.

101
00:22:29,730 --> 00:23:11,550
Unknown: Well, we're gonna start today in Washington DC. As President Trump claims the US is prayer to prepare to transition to greatness. And the
COVID-19 death toll surpasses 81,002 of the nation's top scientists told a Senate committee Tuesday that needless death would result if states
reopened too soon. The Stark warning from the nation's top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came just a day after NBC News published an unreleased White House report showing a surge of Coronavirus
cases, US communities,

102
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:19,590
Adam: okay, now we have to watch out for this word because now they're just throwing it in anywhere they want. And what is what is the definition of a
surge

103
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,930
John: isn't a number if you have one case in your county and then you have to

104
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:34,500
Adam: a sudden powerful forward or upward movement especially by a crowd or by natural force. That's to be more than putting

105
00:23:34,500 --> 00:24:45,180
Unknown: Nashville Tennessee and Des Moines Iowa Central City Kentucky topped the list. The report based on a may 7 internal memo directly contradicts
Trump's claim Monday that the number of COVID-19 cases is rapidly declining around the country. In a surreal scene, Dr. Fauci Dr. Redfield and food
and drugs Commissioner Dr. Steven Hahn all join the Senate Health Committee remotely while they quarantine after being exposed to the virus, or to a
staffer at the White House who tested positive. Republican senator lamar alexander from Tennessee was also in quarantine. After his staffer tested
positive, he presided over the hearing from his home of the senators who joined the hearing in person. Most democrats wore masks or balaclavas. Most
republicans did not wearing masks. Senator susan collins of Maine began the hearing without a mask but put one on during republican senator Dr. Rand
Paul of Kentucky. The first senator known to test positive for the virus did not wear a mask

106
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,870
John: is so important for her.

107
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,340
Adam: Oh, yeah, well, the mask,

108
00:24:50,700 --> 00:25:02,940
John: didn't wear a mask and he was exploiting he, you know, had tested positive and they make it You're right. It's just dis shaming all the time.
This is to get this is all about Trump.

109
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:21,720
Adam: Yes. And do you know why or when? When it will be safe to go outside without a masti I because I know when there's going to be an exact moment
that we will all feel safe. Do you have any idea what that is? No, but I bet you do. It's when the soccer mom says so. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

110
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,400
John: This should this be on the Twitter? I

111
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,860
Adam: think I did. I don't remember that.

112
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,090
John: Oh, somebody.

113
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:33,720
Adam: I just don't want to read something from Washington Post a buried lead. I feel and this was one of those things come out.

114
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,300
Unknown: Monday.

115
00:25:37,980 --> 00:26:49,080
Adam: During a taskforce meeting Wednesday, a heated discussion broke out between Deborah Burks. That's the ambassador Lieutenant Colonel General, the
physician who oversees the administration's Coronavirus response and Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Burks and others were frustrated with the CDC antiquated system for tracking virus data, which they worried was inflating some statistics such as
mortality rate and case count by as much as 25%. According to four people present for the discussion or later briefed on it, which of course, I can't
believe this either, because we cannot believe it in any case, but I'm just reading it to senior administration officials said the discussion was not
heated. Quote, there is nothing from the CDC that I can trust. Burke said according to the to two of the people, Redfield defended his agency, but
there was general agreement that the CDC is in need of a digital upgrade. Oh, that'll fix the problem. What do you do an abacus counting? We're
relying on this data of who dies of what and oh,

116
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,880
Unknown: well, we're shootable. We've got more.

117
00:26:52,140 --> 00:27:00,930
John: I actually have a couple of clips regarding this. One Fauci is the one that saying, Well, I think the numbers are probably a lot lower than they
really are.

118
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:17,130
Adam: I'm sorry, he's saying exactly the opposite. I have. He had a whole testimony where he said is probably double what it is. Yes, what I said no.
You said you said the opposite. He said the numbers are much lower. Say you said much lower.

119
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:31,290
John: No, I I would I would ask you to go back. But Fauci says that the numbers are. I probably put it poorly. You did. Fauci has been saying that the
numbers are higher than we're reporting. He says

120
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,940
Adam: he says he believes it's double.

121
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,900
John: And other people like you said you are saying the opposite,

122
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,480
Adam: including Burks, who is Fauci Burke's.

123
00:27:39,510 --> 00:28:01,410
John: Well, listen to this one. I got a good one here. This one is doo doo doo doo doo doo doo bop. Like find find it I've got my clips are still not
well organized. Rick bright now. Trump, Trump Trump.

124
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:15,360
Adam: This is fun. love hearing you struggles. Okay, we got time. No one's going anywhere. I can play a little interlude music if you'd like while you
look for that. might might

125
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:57,509
John: well let's do the big con. Well, I want to go back to the damy clip first. You missed a little push little gotcha in there. She had. Okay. She
made the point. If she made a point. In that clip of saying that the report the democrats are not only wearing masks, but they were wearing a
balaclava so I heard it I laughed even with a lot of lavas black lava, whatever, however you pronounce it klava. Yeah. What is what? What are the, you
know what these things are? They're just like the Muslim thing. This brings us back to Sir-onimous. And his claim that we're being turned into a
Sharia state.

126
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:08,790
Adam: That's a good one. I forgot about that. Yeah. Yeah. balaclava. There's, well, a balaclava to me just looks like just some kind of curve chief.

127
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:19,620
John: Well, if you look it up, it's difficult or the full face once and cover your whole age. Right. Right. And then there's the ones that are the
ones that could be printed with.

128
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:26,399
Adam: That's, that's interesting, because I don't think a single person was wearing an actual balaclava, you're right.

129
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:33,840
John: That's not true at the meeting with Trump and the Colorado governor, his health director was

130
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:54,150
Adam: well, a balaclava the definition is a close fitting garment covering the whole head and neck except for parts of the face. So what happens is he
would have to go over your face over your head and you have the eyes and the mouth open. also seen in many clubs in Amsterdam. This outfit

131
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,170
John: is funny.

132
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,590
Adam: I found your clip. It's cold. desk exaggerated COVID

133
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,750
John: desk exam. Here's this is a classic

134
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,970
Unknown: for all we have to point out Illinois own state health director who had a recent

135
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:21,060
John: second. This is your buddy Laura Ingraham. And I have a few clips from her. But she I believe she actually says Illinois.

136
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:31,260
Unknown: For all we have to point out Illinois on state health director who had a recent press conference, just casually admitted this,

137
00:30:31,889 --> 00:30:48,839
if you were in hospice, and had already been given, you know, a few weeks to live, and then you also were found to have COVID, that would be counted
as a COVID death, even if you died of a clear alternate cause, but you had COVID at the same time, it's still listed as a COVID death.

138
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:58,710
Adam: Well, this story, of course, has been told 1000 times on 1000 YouTube videos by 1000 doctors This is the consistent story

139
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:17,610
John: everyone knows is very consistent. In fact, those two doctors that were taken down, they was at work, same thing. were taken down by YouTube,
discuss this in great detail, but it just keeps coming up. Yes. And Shep Fauci right, Bochy says the opposite is true.

140
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:35,879
Adam: Yeah, Fauci says is probably double. Then he said that in testimony, and that's when everyone went apeshit once again. And I have the I Have you
ever met Ron Paul, I gotta rent. I don't know ron paul's book, I got a Rand Paul clip,

141
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:41,220
John: we have the Rand Paul clip. That's Rand Paul. I put ron paul because it was late.

142
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:47,400
Adam: Okay. Is it the same as mine? Because I already got a cued up? Let me see. Is it is it the testimony that you have or

143
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:53,159
John: I don't have the testimony? No, I have them discussing, I believe with Judy are one of the

144
00:31:53,160 --> 00:32:00,630
Adam: Oh, well, how about this? Why don't I play what he said in the senate? Rand Paul, and then we'll go to what he said at Judy, how's that sound?

145
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,630
John: If it's, if it's related,

146
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:09,030
Adam: yeah, it's about the schools and about getting back to life.

147
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:12,210
John: I think he's just sitting here with Joe. He's just moaning.

148
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,700
Adam: Hold on. Let's listen to this with

149
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,660
Unknown: regard to going back to school. One thing that was left out of that discussion,

150
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,060
Adam: I should probably mention that Rand Paul, I think he's a physician is the ophthalmologist. But he's a physician.

151
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,550
John: He's an ophthalmologist. Yes, but he's still he's a doctor.

152
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:27,600
Adam: He's a doctor, he's

153
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,620
John: a doctor is an MD?

154
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,370
Unknown: Is mortality. I mean, shouldn't we at least be discussed? Put

155
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:35,370
Adam: it this way? He's more MD than tadros. That's for sure.

156
00:32:37,020 --> 00:33:18,750
Unknown: Going back to school, one thing that was left out of that discussion, is mortality. I mean, shouldn't we at least be discussing what the
mortality of children is? This is for Dr. Fauci as well, you know, the mortality between zero and 18. In the New York data approaches zero, it's not
going to be absolutely zero, but it almost approaches zero between 18 and 45, the mortality in New York was 10, out of 100,000. So really, we do need
to be thinking about that we need to observe with an open mind what went on in Sweden, where the kids kept going to school, the mortality per capita
and Sweden is actually less than France, less than Italy, less than Spain, less than Belgium, less than the Netherlands, about the same as
Switzerland.

157
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,220
Adam: God bless the Swedes, man, God bless you. Thank you.

158
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,840
John: For Switzerland. He

159
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:31,830
Adam: mentioned nobody does Sweden. He's a Sweden's the one that stayed open. And I said, God bless Sweden. God bless him for doing that. Otherwise,
we'd

160
00:33:31,830 --> 00:34:48,360
Unknown: have no other proof. But basically, I don't think there's anybody arguing that what happened in Sweden is an unacceptable result. I think
people are intrigued by it. And we should be. I don't think any of us are certain when we do all these modeling. There have been more people wrong
with modeling than right. We're opening up a lot of economies around the around the US. And I hope that people who are predicting doom and gloom and
saying, Oh, we can't do this, there's going to be a surge, sir, admit that they were wrong if there isn't a surge, because I think that's what's going
to happen in rural states. We never really reached any sort of pandemic levels in Kentucky and other states, we have less deaths in Kentucky than we
have in us in an average flu season. It's not to say this isn't deadly. But really outside of New England, we've had a relatively benign course for
this virus nationwide. And I think the one size fits all that we're gonna have a national strategy and nobody's going to go to school is kind of
ridiculous, we really ought to be doing it school district by school district, and the power needs to be dispersed because people make wrong
predictions. And really, the history of this when we look back will be of wrong prediction after wrong prediction after wrong prediction, starting
with Ferguson in England. So I think we ought to have a little bit of humility in our belief that we know what's best for the economy. And as much as

161
00:34:48,360 --> 00:35:17,370
I respect to Dr. falchi, I don't think you're the end Hall. I don't think you're the one person that gets to make a decision. We can listen to your
advice. But there are people on the other side saying there's not going to be a surge and then we can safely open the account. And the facts will to
bear this out. But if we keep kids out of school for another year, what's going to happen is the poor and underprivileged kids who don't have a parent
that's able to teach them at home, are not going to learn for a full year. And I think we got to look at the Swedish model. And we got to look at
letting our kids get back to school. I think it's a huge mistake if we don't open the schools in the fall.

162
00:35:17,670 --> 00:36:13,140
Adam: So Fauci is, is obviously being worshipped, certainly by elements in the media and politicians, and he's untouchable no matter how many times he
contradicts himself or said it was no big deal. And I think you've got some clips coming up. There's one thing I wanted to mention about Fauci. When,
now when when we were looking well, when the Vatican was looking for a new pope. I predicted this Pope by name. And I want to tell you, and I think I
explained how I did that. But I did it by looking for to well really, for looking for one that I knew was going to be some priests from South America.
And I knew it had to be a new world order guy because I am a firm believer that the last real Pope was pope john paul, the first to by the way, is was
eliminated after exactly 33 days. On on his papal throne, one of those magic numbers that we're always wary of,

163
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:23,520
John: yeah, he was. That was essentially what the Godfather three movie was about. Yeah. Well, assassination of a pope,

164
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,090
Adam: right?

165
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,780
Unknown: Well,

166
00:36:25,230 --> 00:37:32,730
Adam: I think he was he was the real deal. And then they had to get some of these new world order guys in and then I saw that the Francis that he's a
Jesuit. Now, I only know one Jesuit. I mean, really, no, not, well, not really, really know, but I know him well enough. And that's the Padre from
twit. And looking at his psychological profile, which I think is representative of the, of the Jesuit model is that of, well, unwanted submission to
control. And there's also a lot of historical stuff about the Jesuits and Freemasonry. And before, you know, you're down the rabbit hole of
Illuminati. But it turns out Fauci is also a Jesuit. And then it kind of comes together. You've got the Pope. He's sitting there and the Vatican with
his billion dollar Empire. And here's Fauci sitting there at NIH with this billion dollar Empire telling people what to do. I think he has a bit of a
god complex and it's being played into, if not a much deeper agenda.

167
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:38,910
John: Yeah, that's an interesting point. I didn't know he was a Jesuit. I'd

168
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:48,210
Adam: only found out myself just a couple days ago, Mike, Oh, that's interesting. I really don't. Hey, if you're a Jesuit sitting at home, and you're
mad at me, then let me know what's going

169
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:55,020
John: on. I'm sure we have a number of Jesuits who listen to the show because they have to. Yes.

170
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:03,180
Adam: Yes. Exactly. Exactly. Something to follow, you know, people yeah.

171
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:19,380
John: So but now she mentioned Sweden. I want to bring up Laura Ingraham clip because this is when she did this. She's doing this new CES you know,
they got all these gimmicky things they do and she's got this traders frauds and winners or some I don't know what it is.

172
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,040
Adam: And I

173
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:40,020
John: datum angle finger kind of thing. She does. Okay, so she but this would once she did this little, little, little bit. These are all short. I
thought to myself, besides thinking about Sweden, I said, This isn't being covered very well. She's absolutely correct. And this is the Ingraham,
Florida and Georgia clip.

174
00:38:40,710 --> 00:39:04,200
Unknown: And now on to the frauds. Let's start with Pennsylvania health Secretary Rachel Levine, who weeks ago ordered nursing homes to admit COVID
positive patients. Well, while 1000s of residents saw their loved ones and family members die, Levine quietly extracted her own mother out of harm's
way, reportedly moving her from a nursing home to a hotel.

175
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:18,270
My mother requested and my sister and I his her children comply to move her to another location during the covid 19 outbreak. My mother is 95 years
old. She is very intelligent and more than competent to make her own decision.

176
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,470
I'd rather have her mother be health secretary of Pennsylvania frankly.

177
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:27,270
John: Well, this Oh, that wasn't the Ingraham, Florida and Georgia clip was it?

178
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,920
Adam: I thought it was

179
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:34,350
John: I thought that was Ingraham on Pennsylvania health Secretary clip

180
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:43,680
Adam: on I apologize. It's the I Alright, now we try that again with with the curriculum.

181
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:47,610
John: No. Well, yeah, I want to go back to the Florida and drill but since you played

182
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,830
Adam: that clip, yeah. There's something to say about it.

183
00:39:50,430 --> 00:40:30,120
John: I wanted I want to play it again because I want you to listen to this woman who is the Pennsylvania health secretary. She's a very strange
looking person. She's kind of a squat fat woman with a long gray scraggly hair. And she talks and sounds and if you listen to that clip, I don't
believe that if you look back on it, you think it was a woman at all? It sounds just like a guy. Now, is it a transgender person who is the health
secretary in Pennsylvania? an old, old transgender? I don't know. Well, let's just give voice that this woman is just just a head shaker.

184
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:37,680
Adam: Oh, okay. This is Rachel Levine. Oh, yeah. No, she's a she's a she's obviously a transsexual.

185
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:43,649
John: Okay, well, that makes sense with a voice. Yeah. Play played again. Listen to that. Okay, well, I don't even need to play it again.

186
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,390
Adam: Now onto the frozen to it.

187
00:40:45,450 --> 00:41:07,260
Unknown: Let's start with Pennsylvania health Secretary Rachel Levine, who weeks ago ordered nursing homes to admit COVID positive patients. Well,
while 1000s of residents saw their loved ones and family members die, Levine quietly extracted her own mother out of harm's way. Reportedly moving her
from a nursing home to a hotel.

188
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:14,010
My mother requested and my sister and I his her children comply to move her to another location. During Yeah,

189
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:18,960
Adam: obviously. Yeah. Well, okay. That's an observation. I don't know if it's

190
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:30,840
John: off putting all right now here's, here's she is talking about this is the story that I did. Nobody's gonna want to cover apparently, if it's any
of its true, but this is the Florida and Georgia clip.

191
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:36,480
Adam: You don't want to talk about those elderly homes for a minute, you want to go straight to the Florida and Georgia? Well, I

192
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:50,070
John: all I was interested in is to is the fact that they would that this 95 year old woman was moved out of the home when they moved all the COVID
people in it's just kind of, well, no, this is worth this talk about this is it's the sick situation, I don't understand what very,

193
00:41:50,100 --> 00:42:26,700
Adam: this is very important to stop. This is the this is the problem. So first of all, it's not discussed, because if it's brought up, and really you
delve into it, you will find that Governor Cuomo made a mistake. And at the end of March ordered sick people COVID-19 patients to be put temporarily
in nursing homes and homes for the elderly, and allowed for COVID-19 positive staff to continue working in nursing homes

194
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,680
John: that may lead him to be president.

195
00:42:28,830 --> 00:43:28,530
Adam: But okay, so let me just let me just break this down for a second. This is obviously now that we have the numbers. And it turns out that over
60% of all infections took place in the home, and over 50% in New York of the deaths are in nursing homes. So I'm sure that Cuomo or whoever made this
decision is not an evil bastard. And it was a mistake, someone was not thinking probably because they were completely obsessed and preoccupied with
the surge and the hospital system. And this killed people. And it has to be admitted that someone has to say, you know what, we made a really big
mistake here. And we learn from it. But the in the United States in particular, but look at Italy, every other country, it's people over 75 and mainly
those who are in, in this case, state run cares, we don't give a shit about the elderly in the United States. We don't care about them.

196
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:44,220
John: Sorry, let me get this straight. What you're advocating is that somebody admitted to making a mistake, you have to because people are not judges
society like this, somebody's gonna make it you're gonna make a statement like that?

197
00:43:44,340 --> 00:44:19,320
Adam: If so, if no one makes the statement, then what will happen is there will be lawsuits is going to be a horrible, that may happen anyway. But we
all for the death toll in general, we have all these people dead, whether it's legitimate count or not. It's important for us to understand it's not
children. And it's mainly people, the majority of people who died were elderly, in care in in nursing care facilities, who by the way, shared it with
COVID-19 positive patients and staff that would help people understand

198
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:24,000
John: this put forth. How does this put forth the Biden democratic agenda?

199
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:59,249
Adam: No, I'm not. I'm speaking as a human being. I'm not speaking as a media analyst. I'm speaking as someone who says that this will not fly. You
have to admit the mistake and because we know it already, the information is out there and no one's gonna take anything seriously. And I'm sorry Cuomo
or his team made a horrible mistake. And we have to acknowledge it and move on and mark it down as something we won't do in the future right next to
don't open up the hair salons 48 hours before they know. I mean, come on. This is this is a learning moment. I'm sorry people died.

200
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:04,950
John: This doesn't help the Trump clock. That's gonna go up.

201
00:45:05,939 --> 00:45:09,089
Adam: Well, that's really, this is really sick that

202
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:11,640
Unknown: oh Hmm.

203
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:37,560
Adam: So what So what you're saying is in order to get it Trump, I cannot deduce this just what you are implying is Trump is hated so much. We have to
up the people dead. Who do we have? Um, pocket? How about those old people send some COVID over there. That's what you're saying. Yeah. Well, if
that's true, then God save the Republic.

204
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,950
John: Well, it's gonna need saving the way these guys are

205
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:44,400
Adam: operating. Now. You're being facetious. You don't really think that's true.

206
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:52,950
John: I'm not completely facetious. I'm skeptical. Wow. I know nobody's apologizing and that's not gonna happen.

207
00:45:53,010 --> 00:46:06,390
Adam: But it's also good to know that most people really are not at a huge risk of dying. It's interesting. I had this I issue and we talked about it
on the show and then

208
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:10,050
John: Sunday after the show I wish I could take it a picture and posted it.

209
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:57,240
Adam: It was ugly. Sunday after the show I get email after email after text message. Dude, dude, dude, dude. This is this is this how it starts for
some people in fact, I I got Agent Orange who was down for 10 days he says Oh, it started with me with an infected eyelid and then the runny nose and
then the cough and then I was out for 10 days. And and one after the other. I'm like, Oh my god, how what poetic justice to give me the Rona. So of
course the eye passes. But the last night which is like after dinner is like 715 730 and we're outside drinking a coffee and all of a sudden my nose
starts running like crazy. like crazy

210
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:01,170
John: the power of suggestion ladies and gentle well and you know what i did

211
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:23,820
Adam: against that for the power suggestion I I thought to myself, what would Jcd do? So I immediately went and grabbed 50 50,000 mega mega box of
vitamin D hammer that shit down. And it's gone. I am not dripping from the nose so I don't know what it was. But I feel

212
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:27,390
John: good about it. They might have been right is a good thing to jump down to d3

213
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:37,920
Adam: is it ww Jcd came we came right and Ryan's not a doctor, you are not a doctor, but I was very happy.

214
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:58,020
John: Very happy it is I I think I had to say I had a similar not an eyeball thing. Followed by that. But I thought I was catching something during
the era that JC buzzkill jr had, he did have it. And apparently, Jesse had a diversion where you'd lost your sense of smell. Yes, I've

215
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,250
Adam: heard that I've heard this too.

216
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:31,170
John: During that little period, I was sketching something. And it was like this this is this and it was weird too. It wasn't like the normal kind of
like oh, I think I'm getting a cold I'm getting the flu or something. Right. And I just said I'm just taking the D I have to take some d3 and it was
going that was the end of that and it was all over. We'll see it down the road if you have antibodies anyway. Let's go to Okay, I think we're over
with dead load segment let's talk about the Florida and Georgia thing which is what I wanted to discuss initially

217
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,820
Adam: Yeah, that was the initial idea

218
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:52,680
Unknown: the two states that opened up first Florida and Georgia both are continuing to see declines and COVID infections while shocking the liberal
haters but not to you because we told you that the virus was probably weakening and that people would innovate to stay safe and

219
00:48:53,549 --> 00:48:54,239
innovate

220
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:06,840
John: know what she means you innovate me six feet apart or who knows what to whatever how in the case nobody is discussing the you know when Georgian
more than Florida yes

221
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:10,320
Adam: they were they busted wide open so what's going on everything's fine

222
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:17,730
John: and everybody jumped all over the republican governor because you know Stacey Abrams wouldn't have done this no state

223
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:22,500
Adam: locked up in the Bay State yeah in the basement you'd be still

224
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:23,460
Unknown: yeah

225
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:30,090
Adam: she's a Stacey Abrams would never make a mistake like that but otherwise I guess it's just fabulous then

226
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:43,680
John: well well the whole This is just as getting more and more promises is not this is a new world order. I you know the amazing Polly found some
documents saying this whole thing was a test.

227
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:51,540
Adam: Of course I've seen amazing Bollea is amazing.

228
00:49:52,470 --> 00:50:14,100
John: So amazing. Polly does this thing and it's and by the way, if you get the last newsletter is a link in there, it's still up it won't be up
forever cuz it People see this and they there's nothing in there that's inaccurate. She's just taking from official documents and showing them and but
they find ways to go, Oh, no, this is bad. It's bad influence on the done the youngins or something. I don't know why they take her down.

229
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:40,020
Adam: Well, the beauty of it all, is that in certainly in the United States, not so in other countries, but in the United States. It is all voluntary.
I mean, we have court case after court cases being struck down against people who are being arrested, etc. So it is really up to us. And and that's
it's actually much bigger and much more frightening to me that we have this social control of

230
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,790
John: shaming, shaming. Yeah, it

231
00:50:41,790 --> 00:51:00,750
Adam: truly is shaming. I mean, just just because we're still on opening up and stuff. I have two clips about California. Because it's very confusing.
Is California open is a closed Mayor guard city at our city of Los Angeles County has extended the stay at home order through August.

232
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:09,960
Unknown: But what does that mean? Let's start with the stay at home orders. I know your top health official said yesterday expect to extend the orders
for another three months in order.

233
00:51:10,200 --> 00:52:10,920
But explain exactly what that means. Sure, I think we have to all recognize that we're not moving to Arne COVID-19. We're learning to live with it.
It's important not to overreact. But it's important to take this serious because it is as dangerous today, as it was the first day that it arrived in
our cities in our country. So quite frankly, there's no so called Open state or open country that doesn't continue to have health orders, telling us
to cover our faces physically distance, and to tell people that you're safest working from and staying at home. That's all that the county health
director was saying. And we can't expect that to disappear in a matter of weeks or even a few months. At the same time. We're learning a lot of really
important lessons about how to safely reopen sectors and places. And we have to assess each of those steps give three or four weeks time to see Is
there any additional spread? Are we endangering more people? And how can we keep our most vulnerable safe, so we are learning to live with it at the
same moment that we are also learning the lessons of how to do that.

234
00:52:11,069 --> 00:52:58,979
Adam: So I believe that, that he also recognizes he has absolutely no power to tell people or to keep people at home. They're just using new world
order terms. Now stay at home order doesn't mean you have to stay at home because they can't actually enforce it. It's a trick. It's a mind control.
Well, we're learning to deal with it stay at home, you know, it's learning to deal with it. We're learning here, now your mind controlling people into
feeling unsafe and afraid of other people. And so the restaurants like Texas, open up with spread out and I think it's 25% capacity, Max for the next
foreseeable, whatever. And then in California, I will say here's some of your innovation. All right.

235
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:03,720
Unknown: What do we got here? We've got Oh, look at look at this. Look closely at this.

236
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:04,830
That's a restaurant

237
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:08,250
that's using mannequins to fill out the half empty dining room.

238
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,660
What's the story behind this one?

239
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:23,910
Adam: Because it looks so crappy. They're putting mannequins at the other table. So the restaurant looks more fun and fool instead of actual people.
Smoke and Mirrors out there. lala land.

240
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:25,680
John: Wow.

241
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:28,320
Adam: Yeah, so that one, yeah. So it's

242
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:31,440
John: who's got that kind of money? Those things aren't cheap. Those good mannequins.

243
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:44,400
Adam: Who's got it? You can't You can't run a restaurant at 25% capacity. You can run it at 50 you can't run it. You can't It's crazy. What you don't

244
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:55,290
John: this shaming thing. Let's get back to the shaming. Okay, this is interesting. It's just like the whole thing is like the it's the democrats that
are the shamers because the democrats are the shamers let's just be honest about it.

245
00:53:55,319 --> 00:54:02,309
Adam: No, no, but even johannah was she recognized it and said it she's I'd never expected this kind of shaming from liberals.

246
00:54:02,759 --> 00:54:13,679
John: Yeah, shame, shame. Shame on you. Yeah. Which of course, eventually show tries to become Shame on you for voting for Trump. Shame on you for
being a Republican. Yes.

247
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:20,370
Adam: If you vote for Trump, you're voting for the virus. you vote. Vote for Trump.

248
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:32,640
John: Democrats strategies all over that mean? A vote for Trump is a vote for the virus giving

249
00:54:33,690 --> 00:55:16,710
Adam: it away ladies and gentlemen that was $100,000 idea and two points of all the Media Buy dammit. dammit dammit dammit should have known better.
So what is going to what? It's weird because the testing is now has been kind of it's not really in the conversation at the moment is going to watch
it well. No, it's not not the way it was. But it's going to come roaring back because China just made their move. I think I think this is a move
against Trump. And Xi jingping. He says, the CCP will be testing 14 million people in Wu Han in 10 days time.

250
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,190
Unknown: 14 years old Trump

251
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,720
John: has been showing this chart,

252
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:52,500
Adam: go, yeah, this is an information war. And China is saying ha, look at you with your stupid orange man over there, we're going to test 14 million
people in Wu Han in 10 days, which means you've got about 15 you have to have that's 900 tests a minute, for 24 hours a day for 10 days. So I don't
know what kind of Army and if they're going to go into people's homes and Rouse them or how they're going to get that done in 10 days,

253
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,540
John: take a probe up them but

254
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:36,180
Adam: but this whole thing is, isn't it? I don't think it's true. It may well be but I'd be surprised. It's to make China look like they're the
they're the boss. They're doing it the best way. This is the way to go world health and World Health Organization we know what's up. Trump Bad, bad,
bad, bad. It's it's not going to end with this testing, which is like the ultimate we cannot go back to work. We cannot fully function until we test
everybody every day, five times a day. And

255
00:56:36,180 --> 00:57:01,080
John: we had a vaccine. The irony did the testing is the obvious, which is that the more you test, the more cases you uncover, because most people
don't have symptoms and never will. Yeah, so you have so that makes the numbers go up. And then that numbers go up and makes you need for more
testing, which means the numbers go up even more, and then we got to stay at home longer. Because there's more numbers, there's a surge, there's more
cases, what are we going to do? We're all gonna die.

256
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:19,410
Adam: I'd like to do a quick review of the $3 trillion package that the Democrat Party announced to be discussed to be was introduced into the house
because I read it, and it wasn't hard to do because I

257
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:27,570
John: will. Okay, I want you can you do that after I give to play two clips? namely, Amy's take on it? Yeah, definitely. Trump's rebuttal.

258
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,380
Adam: Yeah, definitely.

259
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:29,250
Unknown: Okay.

260
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:30,150
Where are we?

261
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:42,720
John: Well, I guess this is not my day. But let's try this. Let's try the big con fab. Maybe that's the one that's got the stuff about the bill.

262
00:57:43,379 --> 00:57:47,909
Unknown: Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky, the first senator known to No no, no, no,

263
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:54,330
Adam: that's can't be a loser relief bill promoted by dnn dn Is that it? DNS?

264
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:55,890
John: Yeah, that's apparently it.

265
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:58,950
Unknown: on Capitol Hill House Democratic leaders

266
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:04,110
Adam: have unveiled a map Don't be so damn creative with your titles because it's messing up the workflow the war.

267
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,810
John: That was a really bad title.

268
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:16,950
Adam: Loser, loser relief bill, promoted by dn od. I mean, that's a title man. That is a damn title right there.

269
00:58:17,550 --> 00:59:35,370
Unknown: on Capitol Hill House Democratic leaders have unveiled a massive 1800 page Coronavirus relief package worth $3 trillion. The so called heroes
Act would fund expanded unemployment benefits through January 2021. Send most US adults another one time 12 $100 stimulus check and provide $1
trillion in assistance to hard hit state, local and tribal governments. It would also expand snap food benefits fund hazard pay for frontline workers
increased funding for COVID-19 testing and provide $25 billion in funding to the US Postal Service. The bill would not expand Medicare to cover
millions of newly uninsured Americans nor does it provide for rent and mortgage relief or recurring cash payments to US households. The bill would
expand the paycheck protection program to bailout corporate lobbyists firms. Climate activists say the bill also fails to close loopholes for big
polluters, Greenpeace USA tweeted quote fossil fuel CEOs will be rejoicing that Congress has once again left the door wide open for handouts to
struggling mismanaged oil and gas corporations. Just that

270
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:42,180
John: this was a slanted report as if this oil was a corrupt bill to protect polluters.

271
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,560
Adam: It is a crap I just want to respond to

272
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,170
John: Trump's response to this just one

273
00:59:49,170 --> 01:00:03,810
Adam: thing before I before I forget the lobbyist thing. I just need to I just need to because that was that was the solution to how she reported that
Because it was it was really lame what she did there to provide

274
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:14,730
Unknown: for rent and mortgage relief for recurring cash payments to US households, that they'll would expand the paycheck protection program to bail
out corporate lobbyists firms. Okay.

275
01:00:14,910 --> 01:01:08,160
Adam: So to say that because it there's, I read this thing, to my knowledge, nowhere in the bill does it say, oh, here's a special provision for
corporate lobbying firms. That is not reporting what Amy did there that is editorializing because there is a joke now going around in DC, that the
lobbying group that represents lobbyists, has said they need payroll Protection Act money. Otherwise, they can't help Washington. Right, very bills
they're voting on. So it's a circular thing that they want. They want money from the bill they helped write so they can continue to write bills. But
there's nothing in that bill that says he's going to help lobbying firms. But you I so I don't know why. Because it's really a slam against Pelosi,
I'm

276
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:22,140
John: not sure why, why she would die would think she would be all in. But maybe that's how she makes she imbalanced. She twist the story in such a
way that it's as though the debt the Republicans had some input in this doll their fault. Well,

277
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:30,330
Adam: believe me, the republican party I see on the hill had no hand in this. Right. Well, here's

278
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:32,850
John: what Trump is Trump on the Pelosi bill.

279
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,200
Unknown: You agree that stimulus should move forward? There's been some Republicans who suggest that

280
01:01:38,940 --> 01:02:19,530
certainly not the package that I saw today. Basically, if you look at that package, what they want more than anything else, is it's a voting package.
They want to be able to make sure that Republicans can't win an election by putting in all sorts of mailing ballots. Now, that's the problem with mail
in ballots, are they going to dump a whole pile of ballots on your desk, just before the election? So the problem with the mail in ballots is subject
to tremendous corruption, tremendous corruption, cheating, that so I'm against it. And if you look at the bill that Nancy Pelosi is putting in has a
lot to do with elections and that we're not going to, we're not going to lose elections because of that.

281
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:44,940
Adam: I don't find that to be true. I don't think Trump's truthful, either. I mean, I went through this bill, I reviewed several different reviews of
the bill because there's a lot of legal ease is what this is. It's really and it's typical. It's an omnibus bill, so they take a whole bunch of stuff
that's been waiting around has been sitting, you know, it's been in the process being in committee. It's, you know, it's different people's important
little bills,

282
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:46,620
John: and like sweeping up the mesh,

283
01:02:46,650 --> 01:04:27,840
Adam: and that yes, and they put it all together into this huge bill and and therefore, it's disjointed. The only way it flows together is by
continuously saying, we're going to get so an example $25 billion to the United States Postal Service to help combat the Coronavirus and COVID-19.
Understand how they do it. So it's just $1 billion to the no agenda show to help combat Coronavirus and COVID-19. If only So, a lot of existing bills
wrapped into one. Almost every inspector general gets a little extra an extra budget usually from a million to several million so that they can
accurately have oversight and investigate any misdoings with the money which is meant to investigate and to support and combat but to combat
Coronavirus and COVID-19 $100 million. And by the way, these numbers you realize like 100 million here 500 million here. It's really nothing we're
talking trillions is 1000 billion, so much money. So 100 million to violence against women and other domestic abuse victims. Community Oriented
Policing, which I I love it sounds like something I want a part of 300 million. There are state bailouts to compensate for revenue shortfall. 540
billion sounds about right. That's what that's what New York, California and an Illinois need. So that's in there. 25 billion, as I said to the United
States Postal Service, couple of billion for some work programs. Every single department gets a top up, you know, hey, you need some money. 30 million

284
01:04:27,870 --> 01:05:38,790
extra for you to combat Coronavirus and COVID-19. Sadly, the Ryan White HIV program loses $10 million. They're taking that away from the dead aids boy
for COVID-19. I don't know why exactly, but they turn around and give half a billion to the NADN II D add which is Fauci his group. He gets $500
million Do you know to combat Coronavirus 7 billion for it states Child Care Services 90 billion for Schools. Then there's the student loan
forgiveness up to $10,000. And of course, there's a 12. Another second stimulus check of 12 $100. And extension of unemployment benefits
infrastructure. Oh, boy, they put it in there $15 billion for highways, which is like, no, that's nothing. But they did add another 15 billion
reserved for overrun, because that's how the government works. You know, it might be double that $100 billion $100 billion for rental assistance. I
don't know what Judy read, but it's right there in the document. $100 billion. For what

285
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:40,019
John: that would Amy,

286
01:05:40,259 --> 01:05:45,149
Adam: Amy 11 billion assistance for the homeless?

287
01:05:45,569 --> 01:05:51,239
John: Oh, what was she reading? everything you're saying here is an MBA had nothing to do with her interpretation?

288
01:05:51,240 --> 01:06:21,900
Adam: I don't know. I'm, I'm just telling you what I saw 11 billion for the homeless assistance, which, interestingly, interestingly, was not worded
as people experiencing homelessness. It was just homeless assistance. And then they shored up the language around relief funds. So the stimulus so the
SBA loans who can have it, who can't and I think this is the big point that, you know, if you listen to Tucker Carlson, which I did not clip, they're
gonna give the money to illegals.

289
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:28,860
John: So it's not good enough, you don't need to clip no challenge just like him.

290
01:06:29,279 --> 01:06:42,869
Adam: Nowhere in this document doesn't say that. But remember, this is the heroes act. So the heroes act wants to honor the heroes. And the Heroes is

291
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:46,259
John: trying to give again, this called the heroes act, right.

292
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:58,080
Adam: And the heroes include people who are what is the tour? What kind of workers do we have right now we have what we have essential and non
essential. Yeah,

293
01:06:58,379 --> 01:07:00,629
John: so grocery store checkout clerks,

294
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:01,260
Adam: right.

295
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:03,360
John: Heroes.

296
01:07:03,420 --> 01:08:09,150
Adam: And as we have discussed many times in the past, in the United States, if you are living here illegally, you are undocumented, if you have a
job, construction, domestic work restaurant kitchen, you can obtain from the IRS at TI n a taxpayer information number, and you can pay taxes every
single month or every two weeks. And you it's completely legit. So you're not committing tax fraud, even though you're here illegally and don't have
all your other papers in order. And of course, there's no payroll, the whole bunch of things that don't work, but this has been accepted behavior for
decades. As long as you pay your taxes in America, it's okay. So what they specified in this bill is how anybody should be eligible for relief funds
retroactively, as long as they have a taxpayer identification number. So you don't have to be here legally. And in addition to that, essential workers

297
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:11,700
Unknown: cannot be

298
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:51,660
Adam: deported. They need to be protected these heroes, because they work in kitchens, they work in cleanup, etc. And that's quite a lot of people, a
lot of heroes who are here illegally and work in those jobs and are thus considered essential, wildly legal. And that is it's an amnesty. Because once
you know if it's like hey, during Coronavirus, you can't deport people who work in kitchens, or work in cleaning services or etc. It's quite broad the
podcasters are also essential personnel literally stated podcasting.

299
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,920
John: So that guessing is actually mentioned in the bill.

300
01:08:55,950 --> 01:09:15,510
Adam: Yes, yet not No, no, no, no, no, no, not this one in the one in the original from the federal government, under Media Services, under Media
Services, the original bill or the original recommendation, because there's no bill not sure that Yeah, I am because I put it in the show notes. I
remember these things.

301
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:28,110
John: I like to see it. God right after I'm just saying it's just that seems unusual. Okay. I've only said put in one document and that was the Los
Angeles County health department's

302
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:47,190
Adam: I'll get it for you. So anyway, that is, of course, a non starter because it's a sneaky way of providing some form of amnesty and until
Coronavirus is over which it never will be then these people could not be deported or could not be you know, dealt with as illegals

303
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:51,120
John: but then again, an interesting trick is a well did Tucker's right.

304
01:09:52,380 --> 01:11:16,110
Adam: But but it's not entirely true. He says it. So then there are payroll tax cuts for corporate have employees working during the pandemic and then
all of a sudden a whole telecom section? No price gouging rules. There will be money for free Wi Fi at and around schools and libraries, emergency
broadband for those who cannot afford it. And if you can't afford any kind of phone, or any kind of device, we've got the new Obama phone, and it's a
they call it the enhanced Lifeline with 4g LTE, yeah, you got a 4g LTE Trump phone, exactly. Corona phone. And all of a sudden in there, and this is
how it's so obvious that this is just a bill stuck together by other bills. There's a heading that says Don't break the tea band. Like what? What is
this? It's clearly a slogan. And yes, it is the repeal of the tea band auction for telephony. That's very important for Coronavirus obviously and
whatever lobbyists from the telecommunications industry who put that in there with the existing headline Don't break the tea band that that was really
the for me,

305
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:17,100
John: that's pretty sloppy

306
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:21,180
Adam: the build through I was like okay, this is horrible. It's sloppy.

307
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:36,660
John: I mean, of course Trump already said is do and the Republicans aren't gonna vote for no no. So they're gonna have to redo it. But what if this
is this bad right off the bat and they're gonna massage a little bit could could it get worse? Because eventually something's going to get passed.

308
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:47,580
Adam: Well, let's listen to Pelosi on tapper just you can get we can get into her head. She's wearing her little crunchy fur around her reptilian
neck. I can say that because I don't like

309
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:48,960
John: levar she's wearing a bottle it's

310
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,420
Adam: not a buck Lavazza cushy, cushy,

311
01:11:51,720 --> 01:12:29,040
Unknown: and the fact is that an all for the bills that have passed before they've all been bipartisan, and we've all in our caucus have agreed that
everything is Coronavirus, centric, and also in a timely way that relates to the virus. It's too deadly to our lives to our livelihood, to our
democracy, for us to use it for any other purpose. So when the money for state and local it's to lay the cost of the defray the cost of the outlays
they've made for Coronavirus and the revenue loss because of the Coronavirus Testing, testing the three pillars honor are here. This

312
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:35,400
Adam: is very interesting. Listen to how she doesn't she doesn't really care about anything. But power.

313
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:41,490
John: And yes. Did you notice that she was about to say yes. That's why starting testing that's

314
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:55,800
Adam: why I stopped it. She's about to say a number of things here which she just listened to what she's really saying. And you tell me if she's
concerned about the virus or about her position and party and and well, man bad

315
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:59,160
Unknown: Coronavirus Testing, testing the three pillars.

316
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:04,800
Adam: Okay, the three pillars? I thought it was gonna be testing, testing, testing, but the three pillars Oh, no, it's very different.

317
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:14,730
Unknown: I know our heroes, by supporting our state and local entities, honor our heroes so that they don't lose their jobs, these heroes don't lose
their jobs. Open up How

318
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:28,590
Adam: about opening up the hospitals for other things, Nancy, instead of Oh, honor that? What does it mean? How do I honor our heroes so they don't
lose their jobs? What can I do with my honoring them? How will that how will that possibly help?

319
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:36,840
Unknown: these heroes don't lose their jobs, open up government by testing, tracing, treatment, etc.

320
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:50,160
Adam: Testing. Wait a minute. So the most important question we have this is the most powerful woman in American politics. How do we open up our
states? I want to know opening up my state here in Texas,

321
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:57,870
Unknown: what do I need to do? Again, Nancy is telling us their jobs, open up government by testing, tracing, treatment, etc.

322
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:03,930
Adam: Testing, tracing treatment, etc. That's worse than Trump's plan.

323
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:06,660
Unknown: It's not that

324
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,140
Adam: maybe it's just me.

325
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:46,020
Unknown: And the third is putting money in the pockets of American people. All of it timed and centric to the Coronavirus. We would be an endless
amount of money if we put our wish list for the future and there, but that is not what the case is. And sometimes I get a little heat from my own
folks who say why can we do this in this bill and that and the best because that's not what the bills about. This bill is for this purpose. And it's a
big price. But it's a big problem. And as chairman of the Fed said Think Big because the interest rates will never be lower. And so we are they've
used the interest rates.

326
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:56,370
Adam: Here. Here it is. This is where she goes into full on partisan mode. She said well, the Secretary said interest rate too low they use it for
that we're gonna use it for this

327
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:15,330
Unknown: will never be lowered. And so we are they've used the interest rates to give confidence that credit will be available because the interest
rates are low. We want those same interest rates, and they use it to bolster the stock market. We want to use it to bolster the American people.

328
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:27,420
Adam: So true, Nancy, this woman is horrible. And that leads me to another horrible individual and only because you were talking about the Irish
helicopter money.

329
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:30,000
Unknown: With Yes, yeah.

330
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:33,750
John: Troy did you find this started throwing money out knife? I

331
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:36,930
Adam: thought I found another helicopter from the mooch

332
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:40,050
Unknown: Anthony, are they doing too much or too little? Well, I

333
01:15:40,050 --> 01:16:09,810
John: think they need more helicopter money to be handed I mean, I we did that analysis. It's about $3,000 a person and 15 $100 for a child and
they're offering of 12 105 100 respectfully. So yes, I think they need to put up more helicopter money, they just injected or they're gonna pass a
quarter million dollar additional small business stimulus. And I predict that they will send more helicopter money to the average American this will
be a main street and Wall Street recovery program.

334
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:20,100
Adam: Helicopter money helicopter money helicopter money. I guess that should be as a show Title One day a man Geez. Hell helicopter money.

335
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:23,610
John: Why is he using the term? But maybe he

336
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:36,210
Adam: has a helicopter and wants to throw some cash out? I don't think I don't think I've ever heard that. I've heard the term but I it's like
helicopter parents. The parents aren't actually flying in a helicopter above the kid. Well, I did because I had a helicopter

337
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:39,180
John: hovering around. I actually did that.

338
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:45,630
Adam: Okay, so we've done the bailout. Excuse me?

339
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:58,260
John: Well, beside before we go on, because she Pelosi did say something there on the interest rates will never get lower. Let's play another Trump
clip from his when his little meeting there. Trump on negative interest rates

340
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:13,710
Unknown: turned Holliday said that he wasn't interested in bringing interest rates negative and that he saw a need for additional stimulus from
Congress. I know that you said we could wait and see on stimulus and that you, you want negative rates. So you react well

341
01:17:13,710 --> 01:18:18,390
out of labor and negative rates only if other countries that are competitors, with Germany have third ally. They're friends of ours, but they're still
competitors on trade and other things. So Germany, Japan, others have negative rates. And I think if they do, we're the most prime of the world, you
know, where it's based in many countries based on the dollar the dollar is by far the strongest, most powerful currency in the world. We've made it
more powerful, we've made it stronger. And certainly if they're going to have the advantage of negative rates we should do I feel strongly we should
have negative rates, negative rates is basically where they pay you interest. If you borrow money. This is a new one. I've been looking for something
like that all my life. That's a pretty good one. Certainly, if other countries are going to be paid for putting out money, I mean, think of it they're
borrowing money instead of paying interest and getting paid. It's the craziest thing. But you know what other countries are doing it? Look at Germany,
look at Japan, look at others. And we're the most prime in the world right now. And we have this we have the currency and we have we have the power of
the dollar.

342
01:18:19,019 --> 01:18:29,999
Adam: Wow, wow. Just step the hell back and take this one. Clip. So Trump is all in on the negative interest rates. Well,

343
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:36,480
John: there you go. Not always Yeah, he want he wants it. He doesn't want it and Pelosi is full of shit when she says it won't go any lower

344
01:18:36,509 --> 01:19:04,709
Adam: the right. The end is near. Oh my god. So well. Of course, from his perspective, we're not competitive with our rates. So we have to go to
negative interest rates. Whoo, that's gonna be fun. And all of this a mere day or two before the Bitcoin happening? Oh, my goodness, what is gonna
happen in the world? You know, bitcoins gonna go to $400,000 in the next month or two. So I'm just saying,

345
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:09,000
John: Yeah, according to Max, you know, you can dump cash or coin and quit to show me.

346
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:34,680
Adam: Meanwhile, what and give up show business. Oh, yeah, I know. Meanwhile, the European Union is in such a disarray over over Germany. Because
Germany. I think the European Union is now kind of realizing that Germany actually runs the show. And there it is the new German Republic, the new
German Empire, they

347
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:42,810
John: finally figure this out. Even though the Brits have been telling him this forever. It's Yes. And they're very some Brits. Some Brits have
noticed that. But yeah, we've noticed it.

348
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:49,350
Adam: Yeah. Very, very dismayed over how things are going financially in the European Union,

349
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:53,400
John: huh? Yeah. Well, what's the French figured out? Didn't war.

350
01:19:54,390 --> 01:20:13,020
Adam: Yeah, yeah, you're not kidding. Just a little update. I've been working a lot on my on my computer setup. That would I'm pretty much all command
line now. So I also took the time to there. Well, you know what, in

351
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:14,400
John: the future,

352
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:43,680
Adam: I have decided that computers are, first of all, they're just getting lower throughput into, from you to the machine and back. I mean, that's is
why we have pads and touch and please don't actually do anything, you can't get the computer do anything unless you unless you go to a system that
lets you program your apps and string them together yourself. It doesn't matter. I wanted to get rid of the contact list thermometer spam, because I

353
01:20:44,429 --> 01:20:45,989
John: wait, wait, what? Okay,

354
01:20:46,230 --> 01:21:09,870
Adam: I keep receiving emails, which is spam, for contact lists, thermometers. You know, the ones pointing your head to lists, which you cannot find
if you want to go buy one at CVS or anywhere. I mean, all thermometers are sold out. So this Spam is all over the place. And it keeps getting through
the spam filter.

355
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:13,350
John: I've never gotten one of these things ever.

356
01:21:13,410 --> 01:22:09,780
Adam: Well, I'll never get one ever again. Because the word thermometer is the the one and only word banned now. But I figured out what they're doing.
They reverse engineer Basie and logic in the body of the message. So the subject line, they'll literally say contactless thermometer, you need it now
or something like that. And then in the body of the message, they've they have these sentences strung together, which will always include my first
name, and maybe a topic of interest to me, which I think they probably got from you know, maybe it's on a forum or from Twitter or something, they
scrape stuff. And through that, they literally go against the Basie and logic that would determine that to be spam. By putting these elements in and
the spam detector just can't stop it. It's you know who those guys should be advertising for real products? Because they know what they're doing is
very interesting.

357
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:16,350
John: Well, I'm glad that drove you to to go command line. No, I'm

358
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:22,260
Adam: totally I'm totally command line. It's actually I'm hjkl. That's where I live.

359
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:25,170
John: Okay,

360
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,720
Adam: I live in H you know what h J K L is? No, I

361
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:30,990
John: don't know what h j, k, l l, v, h, j, k, l

362
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:42,960
Adam: and K and L keys on the keyboard are the universal keys for navigation. on command line. So H is left j is down K is up L is right.

363
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,170
Unknown: And this little wordstar

364
01:22:46,560 --> 01:23:14,700
Adam: Oh, it's the VI works that way. But also if you go to the if you go to Twitter, just the web, Twitter. And you go to just what doesn't matter
what it is hit the J key it'll go down, hit the K key, it'll go up, hit the L key it'll like that, that tweet hit the T key it'll do a retweet. So
this is this has been something that that efficient data engineers have been doing for a long time.

365
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:17,100
John: That's what they do for a living they

366
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:35,040
Adam: have two sets of keyboard they get to get things done. And as it turns out, this is what I do for a living I sit at the keyboard all day
managing data, managing emails, managing RSS feeds, managing stories, managing clips. exactly exactly why I did it. I'd like to talk about

367
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:38,610
John: the brain time What do you think? No,

368
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,790
Adam: no, I think we should do a quick thing on China and then we'll take a break

369
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:44,070
John: touchwood to China afterwards.

370
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:49,650
Adam: I'd like China Well it sounds like you've got some China well then we'll take a break

371
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:54,450
John: God really got no China that's the reason Oh, you just don't want me to do giant maybe I get no

372
01:23:55,740 --> 01:24:00,390
Adam: no, you know what? Nevermind. We will go into a break. Oh, I

373
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:04,530
John: do have a china clip. Yeah, that's good. We're gonna do that.

374
01:24:04,769 --> 01:24:29,069
Adam: No, no, no, we're gonna do that after the break. But before we before we do that, I do need to play this clip. You've got to ask yourself what
level has john McAfee sunk to if he's doing interviews on the NIC the rat show? clearly, clearly unawares of what the NIC the rat show is.

375
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:31,590
John: And wait a minute. Hold on. Stop.

376
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:33,660
Unknown: Hey, wait.

377
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:50,880
John: So you get a phone call. Hi. Would you like to do my show? What's it called the NIC the rat show. And he's oblivious to the name of the show
itself so much so that he doesn't figure out what's going on or even listen to an old show. JOHN Johnson is sore during a show.

378
01:24:51,240 --> 01:25:17,790
Adam: JOHN McAfee does an interview with anybody. Any buddy regardless of Who you are where you are audience size, it doesn't matter. Which one of the
reasons why I have no interest in speaking with him because he's already been everywhere. But I think that Nick the rat deserves a Congressional Medal
Medal of Honor for asking the following question.

379
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,480
Unknown: We have time for one more question. Okay, one more question. Last question is,

380
01:25:21,870 --> 01:25:24,870
do you know john C. Dvorak used to write for PC Mac,

381
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:31,290
Adam: I'm sorry, this is not safe for work. And I'm not in the habit of bleeping it out, but it's not safe for work. You have been warned, is he?

382
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,620
Unknown: Apparently, apparently you owe him a lunch.

383
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:39,120
Nonsense.

384
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:41,400
That motherfucker owes me way more than a

385
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:42,690
goddamn lunch. All right.

386
01:25:42,690 --> 01:25:44,940
John: I'm just telling you now. Every time he brings you up, he's

387
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:46,230
Unknown: like john McAfee. He

388
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:49,980
owns he owes me a lunch and but I was wondering,

389
01:25:50,610 --> 01:25:51,900
fuck that shit.

390
01:25:51,929 --> 01:25:54,239
He owes me a good articles Matter of fact.

391
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:59,160
Thank you. My last question. Thank

392
01:25:59,160 --> 01:25:59,940
you so much, john.

393
01:26:00,299 --> 01:26:03,539
Adam: And interview ends of course after that after that fabulous question.

394
01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:11,910
John: Yeah, of course. But you know, I've heard this because Nick sent me a copy, of course. And I thought to myself, first of all is dinner.

395
01:26:12,269 --> 01:26:13,649
Unknown: Yeah, I know. I know.

396
01:26:13,650 --> 01:26:17,910
John: This is this is the so that was irksome. Yep. And then McAfee is full of crap.

397
01:26:18,059 --> 01:26:23,729
Adam: Well, when What is this? He you owe him a good article. What kind of side gigs you running Dvorak?

398
01:26:24,089 --> 01:26:30,389
John: I'm not running anything that he just throws that in. He doesn't. Art. Okay. I'll give you a good article here. I'll mail it to you.

399
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:39,900
Adam: I think you should do an article about how McAfee is overexposed on low level podcast. Not including Nick the rat, by the way.

400
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:58,380
John: I have not written about john McAfee since he was doing he says he created the entire virus environment in con computers. It was pretty much
moribund until he popularized it right? He made he popularized it. For all practical purposes.

401
01:26:58,410 --> 01:27:02,070
Adam: Of course he did. It was a brand he was a super brand McAfee was

402
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:05,280
John: me He first he created the idea of virus

403
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:09,810
Adam: and then he created viruses to sell virus software, didn't he? Is that how it worked? Well, we don't know that he

404
01:27:09,810 --> 01:27:17,670
John: created any viruses but there's some suspicious, he retired rich because he sold off this whole company that he spent all his money. But
literally,

405
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:18,270
Unknown: hackers and

406
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:34,410
John: blow which is kind of but he he, I guess he would he says he I owe him an article because I'm thinking he feels that he's done so many
spectacular things. Not to say that he hasn't because he's definitely been a newsworthy guy. And I should have written something about it. Yes,

407
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:35,220
Adam: that's true. That's

408
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:41,430
John: what I think he's thinking, you know, McAfee gets plenty of ink. It doesn't. I don't know what good it's doing.

409
01:27:41,610 --> 01:27:50,760
Adam: I would like I would just like anybody, just someone who's never done a podcast, just to contact McAfee and say, I want you to do a bucket just
make up a crazy name and see if he shows up.

410
01:27:51,930 --> 01:28:07,140
John: Well, you could actually I bet you could do this. And then you could actually get an interview. Say I am going to inaugurate a new podcast Call
it whatever you want to call it called the john McAfee. Dog, john,

411
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,160
Adam: I really don't care.

412
01:28:08,849 --> 01:28:10,949
John: But I think what he would do, he would do it.

413
01:28:11,099 --> 01:28:37,799
Adam: I am very proud of our very own Nick the rat. You can hear Nick the rat Wednesday evenings, he broadcasts live from the sewer. And of course you
can often hear his show on no agenda stream.com where we have all these crazy people, including ourselves and trolls and all kinds of fun and with

424
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:11,970
John: we did. We looked at his competitors, a competitor to it that we looked at. And this was the one that had vaccines with big seanna and Amiga,
the ugly McDonald's, and that was done. But that was done by Nick de rad actually, coincidentally that he

425
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:14,220
Adam: came in later I think we'd already chosen

426
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:59,910
John: maybe not. I'm looking now let's see what maybe he may have but but the thing is, Nick and then Twitter said that that I know he came in earlier
actually then cesium cesium came in later I see it now. Yeah. And so he says Well, I Nick, who had me smeared on his show says on Twitter that I was
probably I not you as though I'm picking the art because just not true. Believe me. We both pick the art and we argue about it. He says that I
specifically was afraid of the clown. And then it created the threat of John's afraid of clowns, memes. Oh, boy, that must have kept you busy for an

Adam: afternoon.

Adam: I saw the threat of comic strip blogger of being blocked by you. That was pretty funny.

430
01:32:12,090 --> 01:32:15,000
John: Which one? I didn't know what it was.

431
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:27,870
Adam: Oh, no, exactly. Oh, he was just complaining that you that you blocked him and his his even though you literally said why you blocked him. He

John: like, my mother's polish.

433
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:35,160
Adam: Your mother's not even with us. She's dead. She's sorry.

434
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:53,550
John: But she did lately she got an 890 which is kind of a goal. It's not bad. It's not bad. Not bad. It's not bad. It's not great. It's not like that
woman in Pennsylvania. The transgender woman has got the mom 95 and according to her is genius. Even at 95 anyway,

435
01:32:54,510 --> 01:33:26,730
Adam: I just want to know, would you explain it very well. It's a back channel because it's split and then it's true because he had he sent me a
message back channel. dm, as to Barack Obama has not apologized. Meanwhile, he's asking you the same thing and you're blocking him for it. So it's
like I don't like that. Don't do that. That's what that's when my daughter used to do that. Daddy, can I have this? And then you know, the main Lima
already has gone to mom and gotten some kind of you know if they're tricky.

01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:28,740

01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:24,180
John: Well, let's talk about something that's more official, which is Christopher berry coming in with $1,000 and from Williams Ville, New York.

John: I want to mention a little, just a little housekeeping here. too. Do donors that like to dish people and de-douche themselves? I believe
cosmically, it's quite likely that a deducing after calling out people for being a douchebag doesn't deduce you, but possibly deduces the douchebag.
douchebags.

482
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:41,160
Adam: Do we have any empirical evidence or just anecdotal?

483
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:52,680
John: It's just totally anecdotal. And I got it from sources. I got it from sources or intelligence sources familiar with the matter. And intelligence
sources agree. So

484
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:55,560
Adam: the intelligence community,

485
01:38:55,920 --> 01:39:12,120

another term indicating a similar concept. Oh, because I'm kind of tired of it.

hopefully Ghostbusters. Jobs karma will do will do its business.

587
01:56:51,960 --> 01:57:37,170
John: I mentioned somebody that happened to Guardian printed this article. I don't know why cuz they're Woody Allen's on the outs but this is a
guardian article and it says Woody Allen's a rainy day in New York tops global box office. So they've been rolling out this movie that was paid for by
Amazon Amazon Studios kicked woody out. After you know, Dylan Farrow made a fuss again, even though this has been done in court. And one of Woody's
other kids says bullcrap, but he's been accused of being a molester. And so they won't let his booty so they won't even show he's been out. It's not
out of what's the word canceled so badly that they won't even release this movie in the United States. And I saw this movie. It wasn't

588
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:38,580
Adam: on Amazon.

589
01:57:39,450 --> 01:57:41,730

590
01:57:41,910 --> 01:57:43,920

591
01:57:44,519 --> 01:58:27,779
John: I got a screener. interwebs Yeah. I got a screener. And I watched this movie I said as a coach, little after it came out. I think this is maybe
one of his best New York he said a series of new movies he's done about New York. I think this is one of his best ones. I think is award worthy. I
mean, it's a it's a it's a got neurotics in New York again, but it brings us a little bit more about celebrity and the shallowness of New York and
it's just a it but it's a but it's an ode to New York I think is one of his best New York movies ever. And unfortunately the American public will
never get to see it in the theater of course who cares nowadays know all the theaters was the

592
01:58:27,780 --> 01:58:35,160
Adam: renewed interest in in in canceling him was it the was it Ronan Farrow's me to work or what was the

593
01:58:35,220 --> 01:59:01,980
John: it was some of Ronan Farrow and Dylan came out again, started making a fuss. They made a big fuss and they did it using canceled culture
techniques. They started hounding Amazon because Amazon had picked his car. Right, right. Right. Right. And so they started how and and it Amazon, you
know, did he also was supposed to do some TV work for them. And he did this horrible, really bad piece of work. And he gave it to them. It's just
junk. And I think

594
01:59:01,980 --> 01:59:22,230
Adam: Amazon was just so hypocritical, you know, I mean, I'm not a huge Woody Allen fan of his movies. I've seen you know, some, of course, there are
some seminal ones that we can you know, how could you ever live without it? Just seeing some of these great movies, but you're really into it. And I'm
like, and

595
01:59:22,230 --> 01:59:24,990
John: I know I've always said I've been a fan since I saw a movie.

596
01:59:25,140 --> 01:59:27,000
Adam: Yeah. Which was that was the first one.

597
01:59:27,030 --> 01:59:55,200

02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:55,560
Adam: I liked how you say big Chinese hackers I like how you say influence and you can just say control but influence is just warm and fuzzy. Yes. CBS
CBS CBS is on a tear Here we go.

608
02:00:55,589 --> 02:01:16,199
Unknown: Tonight the FBI and federal cybersecurity agents are warning that hackers linked to the Chinese government are trying to steal research on
Coronavirus vaccines and therapies. The FBI says the potential theft could jeopardize the treatment of patients here in the US. Here's CBS Chief
Justice and homeland security correspondent Jeff gays.

609
02:01:16,349 --> 02:01:20,609
Well, the Coronavirus was sweeping across parts of China in January.

610
02:01:20,669 --> 02:01:24,629
Adam: My God Jeff is in. He was official

611
02:01:24,630 --> 02:01:35,760
John: say stop one second, I want to mention something in this particular thing, especially when he's reporting from home. I am now wondering since we
all you'd like to make fun of Jeff and

612
02:01:36,810 --> 02:01:37,470
Unknown: Come on, it's

613
02:01:37,470 --> 02:01:44,760
John: really a great reporter but he's got this funny voice. I think he's got the same condition that JFK Jr. Robert Kennedy Jr. Has

614
02:01:44,850 --> 02:01:46,920
Adam: Oh, really? Oh,

615
02:01:46,980 --> 02:01:57,330
John: when you hear him reporting from home, that's when you're gonna hear it. And I never looked into it. But I bet she's got the same condition
because he's got these qualities. Well,

616
02:01:58,650 --> 02:02:02,100
Adam: I don't know why you have to take my joy away that he's just has to prove

617
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:03,810
John: I mean is did I like it?

618
02:02:07,980 --> 02:02:09,030
Unknown: Do this report real quick.

619
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:12,480
Dirty correspondent Jessica gays.

620
02:02:12,630 --> 02:02:30,450
Well, the Coronavirus was sweeping across parts of China in January. US officials say Chinese hackers were already focused on the United States trying
to steal research from universities and pharmaceutical companies that were working on a cure. JOHN de MERS is the Assistant Attorney General for
national security

621
02:02:30,510 --> 02:02:39,240
that Chinese for years have targeted biomedical research. And there's nothing more important than COVID-19 research right now in that field. The
hacking

622
02:02:39,240 --> 02:03:14,580
charges ratcheted up tensions over the virus between the US and China, which should have been stopped at the source which was China, but it's not just
China, or Iran is also on the attack. Researchers at the cybersecurity company recorded futures say the Iranian state target in an executive and
Gilead Sciences, the manufacturer of the promising Coronavirus treatment drug remdesivir. But demurrers said China is desperate to be first with a
vaccine you call this a holy grail of of information that these foreign hackers are going after.

623
02:03:14,730 --> 02:03:25,860
There's nothing more important right now than these treatments, and perhaps most significantly for China for geopolitical value to be able to say that
they were the first to develop a vaccine.

624
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:37,380
Tonight in a statement Chinese officials said the accusations were without evidence, but US officials say anyone working on a vaccine should be on
hyper alert. Margaret.

625
02:03:38,610 --> 02:03:59,340
Adam: Well, when I heard him speak, kind of in the interview, I heard it what the condition is called spasmodic dysphonia as Robert Kennedy Jr. Has,
it could be could be that he has some of that. It sounds more like you just overworked his voice.

626
02:04:01,050 --> 02:04:04,650
John: I don't know what happens when you blow your voice shot but it could sound interesting.

627
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:19,980
Adam: Well, CBS is doing all kinds of reports about China and this was 60 minutes this past Sunday. It was just kind of interesting how they their
version of the timeline of Corona and China

628
02:04:20,190 --> 02:04:49,440
Unknown: and Trump told us to direct questions about the origin of the virus. To the Director of National Intelligence. The Chinese Communist Party
has also blocked the truth. In the earliest days, the doctor and Wu Han who discovered the outbreak was silenced by local officials. He later died of
COVID-19. In February, the Chinese did allow a visit by an international team of experts, including American scientists.

629
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:57,540
We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in China.

630
02:04:57,930 --> 02:05:13,410
Initially President Trump praised China, but in the following weeks testing in the US failed to catch up to the need vital equipment with short bodies
filled refrigerated trailers. And science was continuously challenged,

631
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:16,260
don't dump dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump,

632
02:05:16,259 --> 02:05:28,229
dump dump dump the disinfectant in a minute, one minute, and is there a way we can do something like that? by injection,

633
02:05:28,650 --> 02:05:37,710
as the US led the one illness and death, White House move the focus to the Chinese government. That's where this began. Last Sunday,

634
02:05:37,890 --> 02:05:45,900
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attempted to resurrect a debunked theory that the virus was man made in China.

635
02:05:46,590 --> 02:06:06,300
Adam: A debunked theory. This has got to stop reporters journalists. Just saying something is a debunked theory is not journalism. Let's see. That is
the mighty CBS 60 minutes pompeyo was trying to revisit he debunked

636
02:06:06,510 --> 02:06:09,750
John: the conspiracy theory. There is never been debunked. Of course it

637
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:10,800
Adam: hasn't been debunked.

638
02:06:11,130 --> 02:06:38,640
John: But about why is he saying it's debunked CB versus evidence that is debunked just because somebody else said it wasn't the case. Because it's in
it and we still you know, here's what's not resolved. People keep saying this. They say there's no bats being sold at that at that wet market. And
other people said, well, it came from bats being sold at a wet market. And other people say there's they don't sell bats at that wet markets is a
seafood place, as our president himself says,

639
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:45,270
Unknown: covering up the spread of the Corona, virus. Everybody knows what's going on there.

640
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:51,780
Adam: Everybody knows what's going on. Did you see the altercation with the Asian American reporter?

641
02:06:53,460 --> 02:06:55,770
John: gets perpetual. Which one is this? Oh, this

642
02:06:55,770 --> 02:07:37,140
Adam: is a new one. This was this was a new reporter. And she's one of the activist activist reporters that are now showing up to these conferences.
Men and women are good looking. They're young, the good looking. The guys are you know, they're kind of hunky The girls are really cute. And this, of
course, if they have anyone who's either of color, journalists of color. But if you can get an Asian American to ask a question about China, that's
even better. But this, I think she jumped the shark on this one. You'll hear why.

643
02:07:37,769 --> 02:07:40,169
Unknown: Rob? Okay. Yeah, go ahead, please.

644
02:07:41,670 --> 02:07:58,560
said many times that the US is doing far better than any other country, when it comes to testing. Yes. Why does that matter? Why is this a global
competition to you if everyday Americans are still losing their lives, and we're still seeing more cases every day?

645
02:07:58,680 --> 02:08:14,250
Adam: So it's like, typical, unimportant unimpressive question that is only meant to attack the President's demeanor or how he talks about something.
And and this, she's wasting our time with this. But then this happens

646
02:08:14,430 --> 02:08:28,230
Unknown: while they're losing their lives everywhere in the world. And maybe that's a question you should ask China. Don't ask me has China that
question, okay. When you ask them that question, you may get a very unusual answer. Yes, behind you. And

647
02:08:28,230 --> 02:08:41,850
Adam: here's what's really interesting. She came back after he said, Well, why don't you go ask China about that, which he's very consistently say
China knows, everybody knows is China. But remember, she's Asian American. So she gets to ask this follow up question,

648
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,640
Unknown: sir. Why are you saying that to me? Specifically,

649
02:08:44,940 --> 02:08:50,340
I'm telling you, I'm not saying it specifically to anybody. I'm saying that anybody that would ask a nasty question like

650
02:08:50,340 --> 02:08:51,720
that, and nasty, please go ahead.

651
02:08:51,990 --> 02:09:08,850
Adam: Do you really think she expected the president to say Well, clearly you got splitty? Is your goat? What do you want? I mean, what the hell are
these people doing? Is that really what she thought? Is that really why she Why do you say that to me? Is because I look Chinese? This is infantry.

652
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:13,680
John: Why? You know, it's the it's the White House can ban these people. I don't know why they let him in. Well, then

653
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:15,450
Adam: you're banning a woman of color.

654
02:09:18,330 --> 02:09:26,790
John: Well, it's it wasn't I would blame. ABC. He's the one who heads up the correspondents to get to go to that thing in the first place. Of course,

655
02:09:26,790 --> 02:09:34,260
Adam: he's the guy that's bringing all the activist journalists in. Yeah. And then and then another good looking journalist from CNN,

656
02:09:34,410 --> 02:09:40,890
Unknown: why does it matter? Okay. Anybody else? Please go ahead. The back place. Two clouds. Okay.

657
02:09:42,270 --> 02:09:43,200
I have two questions.

658
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:44,760
What's your next next place

659
02:09:44,820 --> 02:09:46,380
that you did you call it on me?

660
02:09:46,980 --> 02:09:57,360
I did. And you didn't respond. And now I'm calling on sorry, I just young lady in the back, please. I just wanted to let my colleagues okay, but can
ask Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you very much.

661
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:12,450
Adam: clearly, clearly some kind of attitude or something. And he's like, I'm not you anymore. And oh, but then we just like, That's not fair. You
called on me. It's my time. It's

662
02:10:12,450 --> 02:10:13,290
Unknown: my last question.

663
02:10:13,440 --> 02:11:05,610
John: I forgot a question. I want to question a bunch of kids. I'm sure. What's her name, the Kaley. She also walks out. I mean, at some point, are
you just dare to be harangued by the media there? You're not there's not these are not legitimate questions. Well, they're legitimate questions if
your national enquirer or you know, or not even there, no, it's this. These are, these are just questions to harass the president. And he's not. He
doesn't have to even show up. Ball bomb, I think went over a year without doing a press conference at one point. I mean, Trump's doing a favor. I
mean, if they're going to ask the actual questions, but I didn't hear any questions there was just like, no, are you showing a chart? You know, it's
not what kind of a question is that? What I'm showing the chart? Because I think it's interesting. You know, and I wanted to show it, I'd be what
can't you can answer it yourself. Why you showing a chart?

664
02:11:06,810 --> 02:12:12,180
Adam: Well, we are in, in a modern kinetic war, which means there's no bullets, but the the kinetics come from money and regulation, and maybe viral
warfare. But the Trump administration is now talking to as many chipmakers as possible about building fabs in the US, which some are, of course, going
to do. Apple is moving a significant amount of their iPhone production from China to India. It was kind of interesting to see Van Jones, he had to
some backpedaling to do he was supposed to speak at some conference. And he tweeted, I guess he found out by himself that oh, my God, I'm glad that
this got canceled because I couldn't have ever even done it. And I found out it was it was sponsored by Huawei. And that my takeaway is that's exactly
what's going on. There's so much because Van Jones wasn't just going to go speak just to be a nice guys getting paid

665
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:18,840
John: all these people to speak for free generally. I mean, some people do, but their speeches are worthless. Yeah.

666
02:12:19,679 --> 02:12:24,599
Adam: But But I guess the understood even here professor in Arkansas University

667
02:12:25,230 --> 02:13:14,310
John: money because he thought, way me he, okay, somebody bought, okay. The way it's usually done, somebody books you to begin with, right? You don't
just show up to speak, right? So somebody calls you up and said, I'm going to do it that we're doing a conference, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, we're
gonna pay you so much money. And his case, he probably makes pretty good money. 10 grand minimum. And, okay, I'll do that in this because it then you
tend to because you have to give a speech to this audience, the next thing you do. And I would say all speakers do this, you check out the event. So
you go to their webpage and see who's going to be there and who the audience is because you got to adjust your speech to the people. If it's a woman's
a bunch of all women, you got to think about this. So you go to the thing, and you'd go to the web page, and the webpage really tells you the sponsor.

668
02:13:15,570 --> 02:13:23,580
Adam: At the start of the show two hours ago, you said I don't know why people think I'm a misogynist. But really, you got to be careful if it's a
conference with all women.

669
02:13:23,940 --> 02:13:47,250
John: Oh, yeah. So I'm not gonna deny it. So. So you go to Yeah, cuz Yeah, you do. I mean, I'm not an idiot. So you go to the website, you check it
out. And you get on the website. The most important thing you see on there is who's sponsoring the thing. And the Huawei people would be front and
center. Well, this is no surprise is full of shit. This guy.

670
02:13:47,280 --> 02:13:57,720
Adam: Well, you walked right into it. Because this was a conference of the NA BJ. Which makes it even worse

671
02:13:57,750 --> 02:14:00,630
John: National Association of blow job artists

672
02:14:00,660 --> 02:14:53,070
Adam: close, no black journalists. And so the National Association of Black journalists are sponsored by the Chinese just want you to understand that.
And so Wow. And he tweeted, I accepted invite. This is verbatim I accepted invite to play he's already speaking Chinese. I accepted my role today. I
accepted invite to participate in na beejay webinar. Oh, webinar, warning black community about COVID misinformation. I said yes. Without knowing the
sponsor. Glad na BJ canceled I would not have participated. I'll keep raising alarm about pandemics impact on vulnerable people though. And he has it
posted it says

673
02:14:53,610 --> 02:15:05,730
John: Hold on a second. So he cancels after they can't correct and now they just To virtue signal, yeah. But I am not buying it

674
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:13,770
Adam: but what he's doing is he's busting the National Association of Black journalists that they're in bed with the Chinese. He's busting

675
02:15:13,770 --> 02:15:16,470
John: it because they canceled his money making event. Okay.

676
02:15:17,670 --> 02:15:44,730
Adam: Now Thank you. We always comes down to the money. Professor at the University of Arkansas arrested for undisclosed ties to China. Arkansas man
Arkansas at least went to Arkansas. Another one of these 1000 talents program did not disclose the the money the deals that he had. They are they
charged in arrest these guys now this is this is not some slap on the wrist.

677
02:15:46,620 --> 02:15:47,910
John: Well, good. Yeah,

678
02:15:47,970 --> 02:15:52,770
Adam: I think so too. And I think we should talk about Flynn. Flynn.

679
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:53,940
John: Oh, yeah, I got

680
02:15:54,000 --> 02:16:44,460
Adam: I got Flynn clips. Well, it's time to do it now. Because we are in a very interesting situation, where really the news wants to focus on death
and destruction and Corona and scary things. We have all kinds of documentation coming out. That seems and appears to back up pretty much everything
that has been said about the Muller investigation, the Russia collusion investigation, about the spying on the president. The President is now also
tweeting. Trump gate. Is that what it is? Obama gate? I'm sorry, Obama, Obama gate. Oh, my God. jingles are showing up

681
02:16:44,490 --> 02:16:46,380
Unknown: Obama gate.

682
02:16:49,020 --> 02:16:49,920
This is better. This

683
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:52,410
tag Obama gate. It's what's trending.

684
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:52,980
There you go.

685
02:16:54,270 --> 02:16:56,100
John: Yes, Jennifer. That is Jennifer.

686
02:16:56,130 --> 02:16:57,630
Adam: It's what's trending.

687
02:16:57,629 --> 02:17:23,519
John: She has a very distinctive voice is very, you can you can she just from a professional point of view from listening to do doing voices? Yeah. I
mean, I don't do voice about just listening to voice. She's borderline professional voiceover she has a couple of anomalies. Once they're corrected,
they're very minor. She has got the voice of that's worth a lot of money. Whoa, that's

688
02:17:23,520 --> 02:17:30,000
Adam: quite the endorsement. I mean, the way I hear it, she would fit perfect in our in our morning zoo is like everybody, it's out of a job.

689
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:38,790
Don't you think she would fit perfectly?

690
02:17:39,600 --> 02:17:41,130
John: She would she would do a zoo.

691
02:17:41,219 --> 02:17:47,129
Adam: What did she What does she What does she need to be corrected? Do you want to correct her live? Do you want to lie? Well,

692
02:17:47,160 --> 02:18:27,750
John: there's a there's an inconsistency. There's an inconsistency in hers in her sweet sexiness. Hmm. And it is and I can only express it this way.
It's it's not Maine. It's like when you try to do your one of your voices and like an imitation of somebody you can't maintain it. You can do a bit. A
little bit. Yeah, you can do a little short thing. It sounds like Christopher Walken, or someone. But you can't really do it, maintain it. And she,
she is at that point where she can do it. But there's a maintenance issue. And so she apparently she just needs to be able to hang in there a little
bit longer with the sexiness.

693
02:18:27,780 --> 02:18:30,930
Unknown: Alright. A major maintenance issue.

694
02:18:31,110 --> 02:18:36,660
John: Okay. Maintenance and maintenance by maintenance. I mean, maintaining the

695
02:18:37,020 --> 02:19:30,870
Adam: maintaining the level of voice I got you. Yeah. Okay. So it's very interesting. What I would suggest everybody read and I put it in the show
notes and a show notes calm. And yes, I'd like to reiterate search.na shownotes.com and Bing it.io. no longer work. The developer who made the search
engine is abandoned at the beginning of the year I've ever had multiple people have tried to reach out to him. It the the site doesn't even work now.
You could still go to na shownotes comm drawback, all the show notes? Yeah, it is a drawback. All the show notes are there. Everything is in
structured XML data. So if anyone wants to build a new search engine, please feel free. We'd be happy to resurrect search.na, show notes calm. And so
we're back to

696
02:19:32,700 --> 02:19:33,270
John: the

697
02:19:33,389 --> 02:21:15,779
Adam: Yeah, we really I don't know if it exists. I have three clips. Okay, I just want to give a little background here. And then what your clips. We
really need a daily Flynn podcast because this is truly about the deep state and it's, it's going to, if we didn't already have a wedge in in this
country is going to get a lot more interesting. And I want to I just want to say that Sidney Powell who is Flynn's Mike, General Michael Flynn, and
how this all fits together, hopefully your clips will start to explain it. Sidney Powell is his new lawyer, and she's the one that has pretty much
successfully brought all this to light. She has a complete timeline of everything that's taken place. And I will sum it up as follows. The Obama
administration, and the democrat party with Hillary Clinton, were keeping tabs on Trump. That's why they had this research that was done and paid for
by Clinton and a law firm. And this was all known that this was they even worked with Russians to get it because they just needed some they didn't
really think it was going to win. And, and just to make sure everyone got in the game, and we figured out how to use some phony baloney information
from multiple people to go through the Pfizer, the foreign surveillance for Surveillance Act court, to be able to wiretap and listen in, while not
actually get previously recorded conversations from multiple people, one of them being General Flynn. And just so everyone understands why this is a

698
02:21:15,779 --> 02:22:52,589
big deal, we have a constitution in America, you can't do that. We have a fourth amendment, Fifth Amendment, there's a number of other amendments this
would violate but after 911, we all as a country said, you know, if we had only know more about these turrets than we could have caught them and all
these people wouldn't have died. So the Patriot Act, which was written a long time before that, but it showed up, and in that there was a new deal.
You could listen in on American citizens, which is unconstitutional in at the heart. But we made a special law that you could do that if you got a
warrant from a secret court secret, but you could trust it, don't worry, it's secret, because it will be of the highest bar, it will be so difficult
to get a warrant to spy on an American citizen. It's I mean, we might as well not even have the court at all. And of course, you have to be very
truthful and confident in the evidence you show to that court to obtain this warrant. None of that happened in this case. And spying was done. Here's
where it all went wrong. In my opinion. Trump one, the Obama administration and all the people who were involved with this, everyone who had, quote,
unquote, unmasked, a Flynn call with the Russian ambassador, they were in on it, including Joe Biden. And that's documented. And they had a discussion
on it on January 5, just right before the transition. And Obama said, All man, we got to do it by the book, but everyone sat in that room. And then

699
02:22:52,589 --> 02:24:21,599
they knew that if they handed over all of the information, they have what you're supposed to do, from one president to the next, and the transition
one administration to the next. If they if they truly were honest, and gave it all then Trump would know, immediately he had been spied on and who had
been doing it. So they suppress that and they doubled down trying to implicate Trump in a Russian spying scheme. With Flynn, kind of the point of the,
of the spear, which serve two purposes. One, we had to get Flynn out of there, because Flynn would be the one to investigate and figure it out. And,
and to we needed a fall guy to really stick the knife into Trump. And that's now starting to unravel because they didn't get Trump out in time. They
weren't able to impeach him. And I presume the President's just been sitting on this. And now it's time to release it. And I think every day we'll get
a new piece. And this latest piece that we've received is a list of 39 people 39 or 29. Think is 20 lot. So around 30 people who all requested
unmasking unmasking of these of these phone calls. And if you want I have a two minute clip of NSA director, Admiral Mike Rogers explaining how that
works is an older clip.

700
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:35,790
John: Because he's the guy to play that and then I'll play these three this about Biden mostly Yeah, but it also brings in Trump and Trump do be the
last clip and Trump previews what's coming for predicts right there we go on.

701
02:24:35,910 --> 02:24:51,390
Adam: So here is how the process works of someone obtaining the call that they're interested in, and then we have an American citizen, who would be
redacted and now we have to know who that person is so we can understand what the call is about.

702
02:24:51,420 --> 02:26:24,510
Unknown: So the respect to unmasking. The following criteria is apply. First. For the National Security Agency we define in writing who has the
authority to unmask a US person identity? That is 20 individuals in 12 different positions, I am one of the 20 in one of those 12 positions, the
director. Secondly, we outline in writing, what are the criteria that will be applied to a request to unmask in a report, and again part of our
process under 702, to protect the identity of us persons as part of our minimization procedures, when we think we need to reference a US person in a
report, we will not use a name, we will not use an identity we say us person, one us person to us person three, that report is then promulgated. Some
of the recipients of that report will sometimes come back to us and say I'm trying to understand what I am reading, could you help me understand who
is person one or who is person two, etc, we apply two criteria in response to their request. Number one, you must make the request in writing. Number
two, the request must be made on the basis of your official duties, not the fact that you just find this report really interesting. And you're just
curious, it has to tangibly tied to your job. And then finally I said to but there's a third criteria. And that is, the basis of the request must be
that you need this identity to understand the intelligence you're reading. We apply those three criteria, we do it in writing, and one of those 20

703
02:26:24,510 --> 02:26:58,590
individuals then agrees or disagrees. And if we unmask, we go back to that entity who requested it. Not every individual who received the report, but
that one entity who asked for us, we then provide them the US identity. And we also remind them the classification of this report, in the sensitive
sensitivity of that identity remains in place by revealing this us person to you we are doing it to help you understand the intelligence, not not so
that you can use that knowledge indiscriminately, it must remain appropriately protected.

704
02:26:59,370 --> 02:27:07,620
Adam: And so the 29 people got to see this.

705
02:27:08,070 --> 02:27:12,870
John: And even though you'd notice Roger says there's 20 people qualified to ask.

706
02:27:14,130 --> 02:27:54,900
Adam: Yeah, that was all I'm a little unclear whether that means it's I thought it was 20 people can approve someone who can who can look at it. But
that's it's a little unclear to me. What is interesting, though, is the response from the New York Times, and the New York Times who they cannot deny
the the paperwork that is coming out over this. Their headline is Trump White House, rewrites history, this time about Flynn. And their article shows
a different picture by omission. So they're leaving a lot of things out in background and it's quite

707
02:27:54,900 --> 02:27:55,920
John: sad. trouble.

708
02:27:55,950 --> 02:28:16,800
Adam: It's quite sad to see them. I think they're in trouble because not only can not just anybody go looking at these names, but to leak that name to
the press, which happened repeatedly. And I think there's some documentary evidence of that. That's a that's a jailable offense. Remember,

709
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:21,450
John: nobody's gonna get getting tried these guys are well, sadly I have. I have a ringer.

710
02:28:21,480 --> 02:28:29,160
Adam: Yeah. Sadly, I have thoughts on who but let's listen to your to your joke clips. And let's get into the see how this will affect our future.

711
02:28:29,640 --> 02:29:07,350
John: There is a kind of a follow kind of a cascade effect from Joe Biden going on. Good morning, America. And so this is beef just before the list
comes out. Joe goes on. This is kind of edited down but this is biting on CMA buzz GMA contradiction. Here we go. I know nothing about those moves to
investigate Michael Flynn number one, number two, I thought you asked me whether or not always kill that clip. I'm sorry. That's the clip. I have to
play that clip later play clips from GMA one. Sorry, I know nothing about those moves to investigate Michael Flynn, number one. Number two,

712
02:29:07,530 --> 02:29:15,240
Unknown: this is all about diversion. This is a game this guy plays all the time. The country is in crisis. We're in an economic crisis, a health
crisis.

713
02:29:15,420 --> 02:29:29,430
And if you were reported to be in a January 5 2017 meeting, where you and the president were briefed on the FBI his plan to question, Mike Michael
Flynn over those conversations he had with the Russian ambassador Kislyak?

714
02:29:29,850 --> 02:29:33,930
No, I thought you asked me whether or not I had anything to do with him being prosecuted.

715
02:29:33,990 --> 02:29:34,800
Okay. I'm sorry.

716
02:29:35,520 --> 02:29:41,400
I was aware that there was that there that they asked for an investigation. But that's all I know about it.

717
02:29:42,150 --> 02:29:45,330
Adam: I saw this and I have an observation. Well, wait.

718
02:29:46,110 --> 02:29:50,100
John: Okay. Well, give me your observation first, but I did I have an interesting point to make.

719
02:29:50,280 --> 02:30:04,680
Adam: My observation is when this question was being asked and the follow up, Joe had an eye FB and he was wiggling it in his ear and he cocked his
head to the left. And I guarantee you someone was saying

720
02:30:06,270 --> 02:30:07,830
Unknown: this right? That's not the right answer.

721
02:30:09,960 --> 02:30:18,930
Adam: And you can see his face tilt again in recognition. And then he comes back with an O note. I was talking about this. He was being Sue flayed.

722
02:30:20,340 --> 02:30:47,910
John: Is that the oil? I'm, I believe now that you bring that up? I would say you're probably right, because he asked who was asked one question. He
says, I thought you were talking about prosecuting it, which was the second part when you take the first part from this earlier part of the
conversation. And then you put the second part, which is what I have here in this contradiction clip. When you take those two together, this is what
you're really got. He never said anything or even thought anything about your question being about prosecution.

723
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:58,320
Unknown: Listen to this clip. I know nothing about those moves to investigate Michael Flynn number one, number two, I thought you asked me whether or
not I had anything to do with him being prosecuted.

724
02:31:01,410 --> 02:31:02,700
John: There it is. Yeah.

725
02:31:04,530 --> 02:31:06,240
Adam: Yeah, but he switched midstream.

726
02:31:06,300 --> 02:31:18,540
John: I'm telling you switch. Yeah, you're probably right. Because he's so dumb, that he never thought that that he's already made the mistake. No, I
thought you said something else. So you're you said that you wanted orange juice? I didn't know. You said milk.

727
02:31:18,810 --> 02:32:30,060
Adam: And Tina, Tina and I were watching last night. And I said, Did you see that? And I roll it back? And she saw it too. It's like he's getting
instructions. He, you know, the holding your left hand? What did I have B is the is the intercom? And you're the depending on how it's set up? It
could have been Joe's people talking to him. It could be the the TV network talking to him. It could be you know, just same thing. Exactly. And you've
seen it before where the news reader goes, hold on, hold on, I'm getting important information One moment. So he makes one of those moves with his
hand. He's cocking his head, and he's getting information. He's being told what to say, this is going to be great. I hope there's a debate with Trump.
But sadly, I think something else is going to happen. Well, are you ready for it? But someone has to go down for this spying. And Biden's name turns
up on the list. As and we know why did in he's lying here clearly because he knew all about it. He heard the call. Well, but hold on. Why is Biden
being highlighted besides it being Joe? I think it's time to finally take them down. So Hillary can come in?

728
02:32:30,840 --> 02:32:46,230
John: Well, I'm not going to, of course, I still have never pulled my Hillary prediction. So I'm going to stick with it. But let's go on with this
theory of yours in mind. And this is Ron Paul says Ron Paul, but it's not as Rand Paul. And he's talking about the Biden unmasking questions that

729
02:32:46,230 --> 02:32:57,120
Unknown: have run I'll address the acting intelligence official. Senator, where does that stand? Is Rick Grinnell going to testify to your committee
if you've got confirmation of that?

730
02:32:58,200 --> 02:34:01,500
No. But I did send a letter last evening to the Director of National Intelligence, Rick Grinnell and asked him if he would declassify this. And we got
this information today and released it. And I think this is astonishing, that Vice President Biden and really all of President Obama's inner circle,
individually, we're requesting the unmasking of a political opponent. And you know, you remember there was a hole to do about trying to impeach a
president saying that we're using the power of government to go after a political opponent. This is this is a smoking gun, if there ever was one, that
Vice President Biden was using the power of government abusing that power to go after a political opponent. Essentially, unmasking someone is the
equivalent of illegally wiretapping them. The government had permission to listen to the Russian ambassador, but to protect Americans, we mask their
identity. But you got the whole President Obama's inner circle clamoring around listening to the private conversation. I think you'll legally and I
think with Ill Ill Ill gotten motives.

731
02:34:03,210 --> 02:34:21,000
To You know, Senator, whether these unmasking requests then in each and all of these cases occurred after the election. I mean, obviously, the
assessment was prior to the election that Hillary Clinton was going to win. Obviously, that didn't happen. So did a lot of this then dreads fire after
the election itself.

732
02:34:21,029 --> 02:35:02,369
Yes, the document that we got listed all the names and listed the date that they did the unmasking. So vice president unmasked, General Flynn to
listen to his conversation, which I think is reprehensible. but so did James combing. So to James Clapper, so did john brennan. So did Samantha
powers, and so did President Obama's chief of staff and a dozen other people. So think about this. It's illegal to listen to people's private
conversations you can listen to if you have a national security matter, a foreigner, but it's thus the foreigner saying we're gonna blow up the
capital, will you help me you don't get to listen to the other person. conversation if they're just talking.

733
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:06,990
Adam: Rand Paul Graham

734
02:35:06,990 --> 02:35:28,740
John: answers the question, but the conversation took place after the election. There was no other reason to do it. But now we have the president
chiming in on this, and he talks about it at that meeting of the two governors. And here he is on a mat on unmasking. And he puts a little predictive
thing at the end here, which makes you wonder what's coming next.

735
02:35:28,860 --> 02:36:12,690
Unknown: And on the release of those names of all the unmasking is a massive, massive thing. It's, I just got to listen to this. It's who can believe
a thing like this. And I watched Biden yesterday on Good Morning America being interviewed by one of your colleagues, George Stephanopoulos, and he
said he knew nothing about anything. He has no idea what he knows nothing about anything. Nothing at all. And then it gets released today that he was
a niggling masker. So I didn't know nothing. If you're one of the unmask years. It's one of the very big stories, and I suspect you'll have if it's
possible, even bigger stories coming out. Yeah.

736
02:36:13,800 --> 02:36:27,750
Adam: It's, he's been holding on to this. He's been Wait, I think he's gonna hold on Obama until after the election, because he wants Obama down. I
know he does, because this is Trump. When that that White House

737
02:36:29,430 --> 02:36:30,060
Unknown: press one

738
02:36:30,090 --> 02:36:38,010
Adam: press Correspondents Dinner. That's when Obama dressed him down. That's

739
02:36:38,040 --> 02:36:41,490
John: that's a publicly ridiculed him. That's called dressing him down. Is

740
02:36:41,490 --> 02:36:42,510
Adam: it not? Oh, I

741
02:36:42,510 --> 02:36:44,940
John: thought he was a transsexual. Sorry.

742
02:36:45,270 --> 02:36:50,160
Adam: You are on a roll today hate for women confused about transexuals.

743
02:36:51,810 --> 02:36:52,440
John: For women, I

744
02:36:52,440 --> 02:36:54,360
Adam: don't know what to do with you, man. I'm telling you.

745
02:36:54,390 --> 02:36:57,090
John: I love the smoking hot lady. All kinds

746
02:36:57,090 --> 02:37:52,830
Adam: of issues with you today. So where we're at now is Bill Barr the department. The Attorney General said, Hey, to the judge, I think is in
Washington, DC. we're dropping all charges against Flynn. Clearly. He was railroaded. We have evidence we have hand written evidence of what the of
what the FBI agents were doing. You know, you know, some of the names like struck I mean, come on. It's very clear. And the judge said, No, man, I
don't know about that. I think we should bring in another we need to have some voices chime in here. So one, he's he's got a retired judge who's going
to come in and tell everybody, Flint should be drawn and quartered. And at the same time, kind of this doesn't happen often. But I lost my train of
thought the whole point was,

747
02:37:53,580 --> 02:37:54,300
John: no, no,

748
02:37:54,300 --> 02:38:03,570
Adam: I know. I remember the 2000 names. They got the 2000 name list for the lawyers who were always writing everything. Prosecutor lawyers.

749
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:06,930
John: Yeah. 1000. attorneys say Trump sucks.

750
02:38:07,080 --> 02:38:15,600
Adam: Yes, that's exactly what they did. Again, they sent out a message to the email list. You have the list. Well, you had the list. You have all the
angel list. I

751
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:24,720
John: have it. Yeah. It's always if you go back and look at the story cuz I bailed a couple of these guys to see if they were religious or alive. And
they were they're all part of a Trump hating crowd.

752
02:38:24,900 --> 02:38:49,530
Adam: Hold on. Let's do this. Let's look at how many stories we've had about the 2000 prosecutors. So February 17, Bill Barr resignation more than
2000 former prosecutors. Okay. Let's see what else we have. That's all February. Let's go back a little bit further, because this has been used over
and over again, hasn't it?

753
02:38:49,530 --> 02:38:50,820
John: Yeah, by the media loves it.

754
02:38:52,470 --> 02:38:56,850
Adam: So it was those guys who wanted barters there wasn't another example, though.

755
02:38:56,910 --> 02:38:59,910
John: Oh, they wanted all kinds of stuff is Yeah, I don't know how you search for it.

756
02:39:01,110 --> 02:39:42,480
Adam: 2000 prosecutors is the search I'm doing and it's popping up everywhere. But it's I have to go back further away. I can do tools. Let's do it.
Let's do last year, see past year. That's past you need anyway, it's it's the same group. And they all ended like Oh, hey, we got I got an email from
the group. What do we do sign it, okay. So that's where we're at. And that's going to be very interesting to see what happens. But someone's got to go
down and it would be great. If it was comi. It would be it would be great if they closed the FBI. But Brandon, I think Brandon could be in trouble.
But man

757
02:39:42,510 --> 02:39:53,610
John: branch coordinate, everybody's in trouble, but he's not in trouble. And I'd like to know if anybody can confirm that his security clearance was
pulled. I never heard that it was confirmed. I don't know you're

758
02:39:53,610 --> 02:39:55,710
Adam: talking new stories from three years ago.

759
02:39:59,070 --> 02:39:59,580
Unknown: Okay,

760
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:01,470
Adam: all right. Did not Did you have more on the

761
02:40:01,500 --> 02:40:37,530
John: now that's all I got? I just got the Biden stuff and I think you're probably right this may be the one it may not be the one because you still
have the same old the john Cooper's out there these guys who are you know, old tax democrat party and they're the ones who pushed Obama past Sanders
because you're not putting up with the need to lose and all that banking background well that bankers money and the bankers all said and abandoned
democrats are more beholden to the bankers and the republicans are from what I can tell seems and the book sold on 123450 my god

762
02:40:37,560 --> 02:40:38,370
Adam: that Zephyr?

763
02:40:38,850 --> 02:40:42,240
John: No, that's the coastal coming down to the from Seattle,

764
02:40:42,270 --> 02:40:45,690
Adam: but the coastal is always live, but I thought it was six last time now it's five.

765
02:40:45,840 --> 02:40:50,880
John: Now it's five, it's normally 12. That thing isn't bad. You know,

766
02:40:50,880 --> 02:40:55,260
Adam: you know what that means? What negative interest rates,

767
02:40:55,800 --> 02:41:08,910
John: it probably has something to do with these three states because the Zephyr goes to Chicago and this comes from Seattle, it goes down to Los
Angeles. And the states are all democrats and Oh, God, you know, don't get on a train. Anyway, where was I?

768
02:41:09,030 --> 02:41:38,400
Adam: I was going while I was gonna switch gears if we're done with Flynn, I want to do a quick thing on Bill Gates. And then thanks for more people.
Okay. On show number 780 of this no agenda show best podcasting universe from December 10 2015. This is what we discovered. And Trump isn't yet Bill
Gates knows what's going on. Oh, man. Apparently, at the time, Trump was all

769
02:41:38,430 --> 02:41:45,630
Unknown: over Bill Gates. And we have to do something we have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's
happening.

770
02:41:46,680 --> 02:42:06,450
Adam: He was apparently he was all in on Bill Gates. I don't think so so much anymore. And here is the the obligatory one to show clip of Bill Gates
telling us what's going to happen, what's needs to happen, and it's gonna be an RNA vaccine, and sure people will die. But it's the only way to go.

771
02:42:06,480 --> 02:42:14,970
Unknown: There's an approach called RNA vaccine that people like Madonna Karabakh, and others are using, by

772
02:42:14,970 --> 02:43:55,890
Adam: the way, these are the companies that either he personally, but certainly the Gates Foundation has put money into Madonna would be the number
one. It's why he mentioned it in that in 2015, we've identified that is very promising, for pandemics and for other applications as well. And so if
everything goes perfectly with the RNA approach, we could actually beat the 18 months, we don't want to create realistic expectations. the efficacy of
vaccines and older people is always a huge challenge. You know, it turns out the flu vaccine isn't that effective and elderly people most the benefit
comes from younger people not spreading it because they're vaccinated. This is an interesting little tidbit. And I just kind of like highlighting that
since we know that the previous flu shot the 2017 2018 increased the likelihood of the person who received the shot of developing a respiratory virus,
by virus, infect infection by 36%. And so if you've got old people in nursing homes, who I'm sure are pretty much told you're getting this, this
vaccine, even Bill Gates knows they're not very effective on older people because of the state of their immune system. And also, in order to make it
effective, they got a jacket up, which is, is that I think that's what you use the adjuncts for the hamburger helper of vaccines. And that could make
that viral infection even worse, possibly.

773
02:43:56,460 --> 02:44:16,050
Unknown: And that that benefits on a community basis, the elderly here, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range, because they're
most at risk about and doing that so that you amp it up. So it works in older people and yet, you don't have side effects, you know,

774
02:44:16,080 --> 02:44:18,660
we have in a one in 10,000

775
02:44:19,410 --> 02:44:23,910
side effects that's, you know, way more 700,000

776
02:44:25,350 --> 02:44:56,100
you know, people who will suffer from that. So, really understanding the safety at gigantic scale across all age ranges, you know, pregnant male,
female, undernourished, existing comorbidities. It's very, very hard and that actual decision of Okay, let's go and give this vaccine to the entire
world. Governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on.

777
02:44:57,210 --> 02:45:35,100
Adam: Here's the question with all this Madonna and all this work on the RN a vaccine which is in no means a vaccine in the traditional sense because
it's changing RNA versus building immunity by introducing a toned down and or dead version of the violated attenuated well here's my question with all
this focus from Bill Gates clearly on this RNA vaccine What if it doesn't work? Are we in parallel doing the old growing it in an egg thing?

778
02:45:35,130 --> 02:45:52,530
John: I don't hear anyone talking about it. Because now what I mean we are not buddy Coronavirus apparently does not isn't. That's why they sit on
their couch he said himself in one of these little ditties. There may never be a vaccine for Coronavirus is one of those is like AIDS is one of those
things

779
02:45:53,369 --> 02:45:58,139
Adam: well, like it is like MERS like SARS, like all these things like like Ebola,

780
02:45:58,470 --> 02:46:37,350
John: yes all these things. Bullet they do have something but it changes just enough that it can't really be a vaccines ineffective and what they mean
generally speaking by changes enough not so much with with age but with these Coronavirus is that they degenerate. And then next thing you know,
they're not effect they don't really have the impact anymore. laura ingram mentioned it. The French guy who talks about this together win the Nobel
Prize in Medicine that guy thinks is nuts because he's goes against the grain who says is bullcrap this thing isn't going to last year, no more than a
year because it's going to just turn into dust. So can't reproduce

781
02:46:37,350 --> 02:46:40,470
Adam: and live. You're not on the right program today, man.

782
02:46:40,470 --> 02:47:00,900
John: What do you think that is? And that is what Trump thinks too. Yeah. So this whole thing is that's why they're in such a rush to get a vaccine so
they can at least have something to sell. Right? Well, then we just get back to the chlorine hydroxychloroquine. Let's play one last clip from Laura.
This is Ingraham on OC Q.

783
02:47:01,170 --> 02:47:30,570
Unknown: Now, I told you about seven weeks ago that hydroxychloroquine was likely saving lives. And now another study confirms that conclusion. And it
was conducted by NYU Grossman School of Medicine where researchers looked at 932 COVID patients who are on hydroxychloroquine along with zinc and
azithromycin. They concluded that the triple combo that they were that they were 44% less likely to die from the Coronavirus. Good news take that FDA.

784
02:47:30,930 --> 02:47:42,810
Adam: Yeah, I like the I like the practical results more than just these damn studies that are rigged and you've got you know, certain age groups
whether it's positive or negative. I like hearing this from Texas.

785
02:47:42,840 --> 02:47:48,390
Unknown: What happened to this nursing home was one of the first big tests of its kind in Texas.

786
02:47:48,420 --> 02:48:07,110
I thought the risk of seeing 15% of that nursing home die was just not an acceptable risk. A third of patients said this place in Galveston county got
the Coronavirus. So Dr. Robin Armstrong used hydroxychloroquine pills to treat 39 of them. Most of

787
02:48:07,110 --> 02:48:12,330
the patients who've done well. You said most of the patients have done well. Somebody listening to this might say wait

788
02:48:12,420 --> 02:48:26,940
he qualified with most Have there been some who have not done well with it? Well, I would say I would say all the patients of goodwill. On Sunday
these patients finished their five days of treatment and Dr. Armstrong said no one experienced any side effects.

789
02:48:27,420 --> 02:48:38,490
But this 65 year old anti malarial drug has suddenly become controversial. President Trump said it was promising for COVID-19 patients. Armstrong
admits he supports the president,

790
02:48:38,760 --> 02:48:45,000
but democrats correctly caution that this drug remains unproven. For the Coronavirus.

791
02:48:45,030 --> 02:48:50,340
Well, let's say that the President didn't bring this drug up when we would be having this conversation now. I

792
02:48:50,340 --> 02:49:00,630
wonder, sir, that is about the best question I've had so far. And I don't think so. I don't think this would even be a conversation. Honestly.

793
02:49:00,750 --> 02:49:31,500
Adam: No, I think the news reporting would be hopeful results. Good news, senior saved elders. It's not a death sentence. I mean, all of this could
have no but no. And when all is said and done, and 10 years from now, when we look back, we're gonna see that there was a lot of stuff that could have
been done that the actual hate of the President, not even the president hate of a man. A man with orange hair resulted in death.

794
02:49:32,700 --> 02:49:34,860
John: Yeah, these democrats are murderers

795
02:49:34,950 --> 02:49:37,800
Adam: and Democrats, Democrats. They're idiots. It's the it's the

796
02:49:38,730 --> 02:50:03,930
John: as many Republicans that hate Trump too. But this is political. If they do everything you keep hearing about hydroxychloroquine is totally
political. The Democrats, doctors in the rest of it. Oh, no, it's no good. And then Republicans. Yeah, it's good. It works. We've done it. I mean,
come on. When is this going to end? going to end in the election in November. I'm going to

797
02:50:03,930 --> 02:50:09,660
Unknown: show my little boy Joe nice to know agenda. Imagine all the people who could do. Well. Yeah, that'd be fun.

798
02:50:18,090 --> 02:50:28,860

Adam: I don't like Stitcher. I never used it stitcher makes a copy of our show. And then they have different formats and quality and they put an ad in
front of it. That's really the if you really want people ripping us off, then you should use that. Well. We have an open source policy.

Unknown: In Northern California billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk has restarted work at Tesla's huge electric vehicle factory in Fremont, daring
government officials to arrest him for violating a Coronavirus lockdown. On Tuesday, President Trump tweeted California should let Tesla and Elon Musk
open the plant now it can be done fast and safely the president tweeted, Elon Musk tweeted back thank you. Musk has repeatedly downplayed the threat
of the Coronavirus and cold government imposed quarantines fascist, Los Angeles County's top public health officials said Tuesday stay at home orders
will be extended for the next three months. At least 1300 deaths in LA have been linked to COVID-19 California State University's president Tuesday
announced plans to cancel most in person classes during the fall semester.

Adam: quick trip around the world. I've got. I have Corona in Brazil and Africa, which is an interesting little report

838
03:01:28,500 --> 03:01:37,920
Unknown: not so in Brazil, which is emerging as a serious epicenter. Even though president gyre bolson arrow supporters still cheer him on.

839
03:01:38,010 --> 03:01:39,870
He's provoked outrage

840
03:01:39,900 --> 03:01:47,520
as a COVID denier who still won't social distance. And this weekend, he went for a provocative spin on a jet ski

841
03:01:48,480 --> 03:02:00,450
as the number of Coronavirus deaths passed 10,000 local authorities put a COVID message on Rio's famous Christ, the Redeemer statue, have a heart wear
a mask?

842
03:02:04,170 --> 03:02:05,430
Adam: They topped us they

843
03:02:06,390 --> 03:02:47,640
John: were definitely I mean, they have like 10,000 dead and we have at Cushing 90,000. Yeah, and we shut down the country and Brazil didn't and our
population is 350, there's 250. So they're there, their numbers should be higher. I mean, it looks like an experiment they don't want to do. Because
Boston, our balsan, our bolson arrow is is a right winger, supposedly a kind of a business oriented guy. The left press down there hates him, they go
is basically a fascist. And so you got the same kind of politics going on with Brazil. You know what I want? The numbers aren't really being I don't
think their numbers are high enough to know they're not No,

844
03:02:47,640 --> 03:02:55,620
Adam: they're not. But you know, just just throwing surge and dead and whatever. So you have to see the statue with the with that big

John: to see the statue in person. That's a beautiful statue.

846
03:02:59,160 --> 03:03:04,320
Adam: What I think we should do here in America is we choose to put a big mask on the Statue of Liberty.

847
03:03:04,350 --> 03:03:06,780
John: Yes. I think that's exactly what I was thinking.

848
03:03:07,950 --> 03:03:09,450
Adam: Let's go to Africa,

849
03:03:10,260 --> 03:03:19,500
Unknown: in Africa and Southeast Asia, the virus does appear to be spreading more slowly, maybe because the population tends on average to be younger.

850
03:03:19,560 --> 03:03:24,150
Adam: Wow, that's all you got. You don't have anything about anti-malarials. Okay.

851
03:03:24,480 --> 03:03:26,880
Unknown: But no one is sure. And it's

852
03:03:26,880 --> 03:03:30,870
quite possible that the worst is yet to come. You know, a

853
03:03:30,870 --> 03:03:40,080
Adam: surge is quite possible worse has yet to come they can't stand it. Boris Johnson goofed up during Prime Minister's question time.

854
03:03:40,110 --> 03:04:16,530
Unknown: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank the Prime Minister for his update on progress of testing and tracing this invisible killer, but can you
confirm to the people of West Oxfordshire that the new systems that we are putting in place will in the fullness of time be able to detect local flare
ups is indeed Mr. Speaker and the intention is that the COVID alert system in time will be sufficiently sensitive and flexible as to detect local
flare ups. So that for instance if a COVID is detected in the water supply in a certain town or wherever then then steps can be taken.

855
03:04:17,520 --> 03:04:25,800
Adam: So people immediately went What did Coronavirus can be in the water supply,

John: Yeah. Well, that did maybe that's not saying much for the water supply in England. No kidding. I have one last clip. And this is just a wacky
clip that the mainstream won't pick up on and Amanda Bernie Bernie bros won't pick up on but Bernie it along with Ihara Ilhan Omar, these two
communists have decided that they think that they're all just one The banks don't want this guy by the way, they're never gonna he's never gonna be a

mind, but go on that plate again.

862
03:05:39,420 --> 03:06:29,040
Unknown: For mock independent senator Bernie Sanders and Minnesota democratic congress member Ilhan Omar have joined more than 300 lawmakers around
the world calling for the cancellation of poor nations debts as they struggle with the COVID-19 crisis. This comes as the United Nations warns as many
as a half a billion people could fall into poverty due to the pandemic and a letter to the leadership of the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund Tuesday, Senator Sanders writes quote in the face of a horrific pandemic and a worldwide recession, we cannot allow poor countries to get
adequate money that should be going towards protecting the health and safety of their people to pay off unsustainable debts we cannot allow these
countries to be deprived of the resources they need to purchase food medicine protective gear and medical equipment senator said
