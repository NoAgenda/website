20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,999
back in the day remember I have
a small

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,999
head in order to work well on
TV you

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,999
need a big head so if you don't
have a

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,999
big head

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,999
it's not that small by the way
it's not

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,999
as big as Pat Sajak's or Vanna
White or

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,999
Little Richard have you ever
seen the

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,999
size of that guy's head he had
a big

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,999
head what Little Richard was
anything

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,999
but little it was pretty good
it was

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,999
pretty big so I learned a
little bit

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,999
about about returning back to
work and

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,999
what it means when the governor
on a

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,999
Friday afternoon says hey guess
what you

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,999
guys with hair salons you can
open up on

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,999
Monday 

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,999
you don't think about it as a
customer

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,999
obviously and like oh that's
fine great

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,999
so I immediately this was yeah
I think

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,999
it was Friday I saw the news I

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,999
immediately started texting
Johanna my

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,999
hair stylist to the Stars of
Austin and

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,999
and she said oh my god we
weren't ready

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,999
for this we had no idea we
thought the

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,999
18th is the last we heard is
the 18th

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,999
that would just you know we
would be

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,999
able to take a look and we'll
figure out

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,999
a timeline but all of sudden
they you

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,999
know they threw it on him in
two days

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,999
this was not a smart idea I've
heard

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,999
about this around the country
there's

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,999
different errors and there's
always day

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,999
hair salons and I was thinking
to myself

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,999
I'm thinking to myself self so
how hard

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,999
is it to boot a hair salon you
got you

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,999
know you're standing you need
your

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,999
scissors you need a cut in your
little

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,999
buzzing things you need a
bucket of goo

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,999
for the color this is know what
this is

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,999
exactly what hard can it be
this is what

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,999
I thought or at least the
impression I

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,999
had it's a lot first of all
what happens

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,999
is without you knowing and who
go bad or

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,999
some in the meantime wow man I
hope the

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,999
next person who cuts your hair
stick

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,999
scissors in your eye

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,999
you're horrible three four five
six

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,999
seven seven cars on the Zephyr
ladies

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,999
and gentlemen were still in a
state of

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,999
depression yep

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,999
No so the first thing that
happens is

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,999
without any knowledge that this
would

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,999
take it was a scissors in my
ass not

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,999
nice so I'm warning you really
because

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,999
you know you get my hairdresser
hair

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,999
cutter he he doesn't listen to
the show

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,999
nobody listens to the show in
that dead

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,999
business I can I just tell you
what what

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,999
the experience was so it so you

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,999
understand why I think you're
wrong

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,999
about all you needed some goop
and his

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,999
scissors and some shampoo okay
so

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,999
imagine your year it's a Friday
night

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,999
you don't even know what day it
is

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,999
anymore in the lockdown and all
of a

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,999
sudden some someone of
importance says

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,999
oh yeah Monday you can go back
to the

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,999
hairdresser what do you think
happens it

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,999
gets warm up with order in the
caught

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,999
off guard and there's a lot has
to

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,999
happen there

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,999
there you know we have very
strict city

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,999
ordinances despite what the
governor has

93
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,999
ordered the City of Austin is
going yeah

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,999
we'll get into that in a moment
so you

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,999
have to have policies it has to
be

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,999
published you have to let
everybody

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,999
knows everyone has to wait in
the car

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,999
before they come in you have to
clean

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,999
off all surfaces there's a lot
of

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,999
different things that have to
take place

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,999
and then the fear it's not like
the

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,999
whole hair salon wanted to come
back

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,999
there were other hair cutters
and like

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,999
no I'm terrified so can you
open up with

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,999
half a shop you know there's a
lot of

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,999
questions 

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,999
III do didn't think about it
but then

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,999
when you get into it it's
really weird

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,999
to have your hair cut with a
mask on and

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,999
even even Johanna is like
looking at me

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,999
like now I know this sucks so
bad but

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,999
but it'sit's requirement not
legally but

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,999
it's a requirement based on
shaming this

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,999
let me play these clips and
you'll

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,999
understand we kind of started
on this

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,999
but when the governor of Texas
said okay

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,999
here's what here's what can
happen we

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,999
can open up there's no
requirement for

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,999
masks in public or or even
indoors I

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,999
mean it can be up to the
proprietor or

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,999
if they want to force people to
wear

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,999
underwear on the head but Adler
said oh

123
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,999
no no no we're just gonna tell
everyone

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,999
they need to wear masks I think
we had

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,999
the clip on the last show and
even

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,999
though I can't find you or send
you to

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,999
jail knowing that you've killed
somebody

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,999
should be enough if you don't
wear a

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,999
mask outside all the time in
90-degree

130
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,999
heat so now the Texas Attorney
General

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,999
has sent a warning to Austin
and its

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,999
mayor at a time when some
Austin staples

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,999
like Shady Grove have closed
their doors

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,999
for good

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,999
Texas Attorney General Ken
Paxton sent a

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,999
warning letter in part to Mayor
Steve

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,999
Adler and Travis County judge
Sarah

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,999
Eckhart saying that the local
health

139
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,999
orders issued last Friday were
confusing

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,999
and unlawful because the order
doesn't

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,999
clearly differentiate between

142
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,999
recommendations and requirements

143
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,999
Kelsey Ericksen roofers with
the Texas

144
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,999
Restaurant Association they
also sent a

145
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,999
letter to mayor Adler asking
him to

146
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,999
change section 11 of the local
order it

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,999
encourages restaurants with the
capacity

148
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,999
of 75 or less to keep a log of
all

149
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,999
customers and employees who
came in

150
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,999
including the dates and times
they were

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,999
there and where they sat TRA
says if

152
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,999
small businesses are doing this
so

153
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:51,999
should the big ones

154
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,999
city and county attorneys are
now

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,999
reviewing Paxton's letter but
in a

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,999
statement to CBS austin a
travis county

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,999
spokesperson said in part our
initial

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,999
thought as we disagree with the
Attorney

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,999
General 

160
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,999
mayor Adler also sent us a
statement

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,999
saying in part up to this point
we have

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,999
avoided the naked
politicization of the

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,999
virus crisis I will not fry the
AG down

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,999
that road the city's order
complements

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,999
incorporates and does not
conflict with

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,999
the governor's orders Adler
also brought

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:29,999
it up during his daily virtual
address

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,999
so Adler is trying to do a
Cuomo every

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,999
single day from his office
there above

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,999
the W Hotel in downtown Austin
it's I

171
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,999
really this guy's being he's
not yeah I

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,999
don't think he's left his home
at all

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,999
he's the guy that's pussy he's
the one

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,999
that's sitting inside and
requiring

175
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,999
small businesses in particular

176
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,999
restaurants we had this happen
when we

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,999
went to the first open first
restaurant

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,999
opening you've got it write
down your

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,999
name you got to sign a piece of
paper

180
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,999
and of course people are going
to revolt

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,999
against that and it's not even a

182
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,999
requirement by law but you
heard it it's

183
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,999
the shaming that's where all of
this is

184
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,999
headed 

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,999
one more clip of the response
from Adler

186
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,999
regarding the defiant Austin
Texas your

187
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,999
state is opening up but your
city is not

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,999
yet why not

189
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,999
well we're opening up to these

190
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,999
the governor has has put it in
his order

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,999
so we're compliant with the
state but

192
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,999
the messaging that we're trying
to send

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,999
to our community is to take this

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,999
cautiously and slowly because
no one

195
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,999
knows what the impact of this
is going

196
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,999
to be and it's going to take us
three

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,999
weeks maybe four weeks to get
the the

198
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,999
data on hospitalizations that
we need to

199
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,999
see to see whether or not our
toe dip

200
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,999
here is putting us on a path to
another

201
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,999
surge so it's more what other
surged

202
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,999
there was never a surge in
Texas to

203
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,999
start with but he feels that
there's a

204
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,999
surge surge so it's more of a
messaging

205
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,999
element than anything else we
have a lot

206
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,999
of community members that know
that

207
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,999
while these things are opening
it

208
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,999
doesn't mean we have to go and
it

209
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,999
doesn't mean that we that we
have to

210
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,999
open the governor has allowed
those

211
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,999
things to happen but we are
urging our

212
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,999
community to take this
cautiously and

213
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,999
and slowly so that we can
measure the

214
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,999
impact before we end up with
another

215
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,999
surge another she said twice
isn't

216
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,999
checked just to make sure maybe
I missed

217
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,999
the wording somewhere there's
not even a

218
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,999
headline with surge in Texas
Travis

219
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,999
County or Austin this is about
shaming

220
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,999
and I was surprised because I
kind of

221
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,999
scoffed when you said it but my

222
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,999
hairdresser she said oh my god
I never

223
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,999
Intel she says I never expected
to see

224
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,999
it was kind of funny this level
of

225
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,999
social shaming from liberals
I'm like

226
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,999
what okay

227
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,999
and she said literally it's
very clear

228
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,999
if you wear a mask you're
Democrat if

229
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,999
you don't you're a Republican
it's

230
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,999
exactly what you said about
California

231
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,999
history and and even she
recognizes it's

232
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,999
only to make you feel good
these are the

233
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,999
masks are the like the ribbons
after

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,999
9/11 you know and that is
community

235
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,999
there's also a community aspect
to it

236
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,999
I've noticed this when you go
around

237
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,999
without a mask in a but with
people

238
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,999
mixed 

239
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,999
no masks you can start to see
the

240
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,999
connection you can see that the
no mask

241
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,999
people or the you see a lot of
macho

242
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,999
guys motorcyclists it's kind of
like

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,999
that Larry David episode

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,999

think Republicans will wear the
mask

253
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,999
where you have to wear the mask
to get

254
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,999

another

260
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,999
thing when I'm watching
television and

261
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,999
I'm seeing actors I'm seeing
commercials

262
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,999
they don't represent the
American public

263
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,999
anymore I demand that every
single

264
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,999
commercial the actors wear
masks in the

265
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,999
commercial I'm looking at masks
all day

266
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,999
and I come home and all I see
is faces

267
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:51,999
ooh 

268
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,999
ugly if I put a mask on that
mask you

269
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,999
know what I hate to be this
sexist

270
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,999
everyone thinks I am I don't
like that

271
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,999
so they're what you run into
this

272
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,999
situation but again I just
happened the

273
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,999
other day it's like there's
some leggy

274
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,999
girl or is it group somebody
with great

275
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,999
legs let's just make it be
honest about

276
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,999
all right and she's got the
mask on and

277
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,999
then you starting to you wonder
you're

278
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,999
wondering what what does the
face matte

279
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,999
and match the rest of the body
match the

280
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,999
lake or is it this old woman
with great

281
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,999
lace does he you see that
everyone

282
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,999
survived you would run into
that in

283
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,999
Florida this this is also a
godsend for

284
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,999
older women because they can
have a

285
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,999
scarf or something like Nancy
Pelosi you

286
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,999
have a nice you know scarf

287
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,999
you have around your neck you
can pull

288
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,999
up if you need a mask situation
but in

289
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,999
the meantime a women love
hiding there

290
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,999
you know if they are unhappy
with their

291
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,999
neck that a lot of older women
aren't

292
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,999
yeah so that it can work as a
fashion

293
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,999
statement for them well the
topic of

294
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,999
these mats they do have an Amy
Goodman

295
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,999
clip well before you do that
hit'em Isis

296
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,999
well I'm sorry well I have to
apologize

297
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,999
first you can't just like why I
made a

298
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,999
mistake 

299
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,999
I made a mistake on the last
show I made

300
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,999
a big deal about the foul Qi
clip which

301
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,999
was listed as may 6 out it was
March 6

302
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,999
and and he was clearly saying
no masks

303
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,999
whatsoever it's not necessary
it's even

304
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,999
dumb and right and people got
mad at me

305
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:46,999
John you got two letters okay
dude I get

306
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,999
my letters and your let's be
serious I

307
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,999
get my letters and your letters
so stop

308
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,999
with me I want to play the
original then

309
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,999
I want to get to Amy because I
have a

310
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,999
Judy and Judy will lead to Amy
that

311
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,999
makes a lot so Amy is about the
masks

312
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,999
this is about the mass this is
foul John

313
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,999
the mouse Judy I saw this too
this

314
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,999
breakdown of foul Chi the thing
was

315
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,999
labeled it would when the when
that clip

316
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,999
went out and it was criticizing
you for

317
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,999
playing this clip and giving a
wrong

318
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,999
date there's two things one it
was

319
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,999
mislabeled that I saw this I
saw these

320
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,999
these clips they had a Mis
label on them

321
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,999
they were labeled May and the
second

322
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,999
thing is this is just proving
that foul

323
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,999
she was a debt into the whole
thing

324
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,999
early on and now they're
blaming Trump

325
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,999
with with quotes which I have
on certain

326
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,999
clips I have a clip saying oh
and Trump

327
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,999
wouldn't listen to foul she
thought she

328
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,999
was not into this until later
so here is

329
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,999
the original this is from March
and even

330
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,999
though it's an outdated opinion
I don't

331
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,999
see how the science of what
he's saying

332
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,999
changes right right now in the
United

333
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,999
States people should not be
walking

334
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,999
around with

335
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,999
asks you're sure of it because
people

336
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,999
are listening really know
closely to

337
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,999
this right now people should
not be why

338
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,999
there's no reason to be walking
around

339
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,999
with a mask when you're in the
middle of

340
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,999
an outbreak wearing a mask
might make

341
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,999
people feel a little bit better
it might

342
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,999
even block a droplet but it's
not

343
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,999
providing the perfect
protection that

344
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,999
people think that it is and
often there

345
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,999
are unintended consequences
people keep

346
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,999
fiddling with the mask and they
keep

347
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,999
touching their face then can
you get

348
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,999
some schmutz sort of staying
inside

349
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,999
there or of course but when you
think

350
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,999
mask you should think of health
care

351
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,999
providers needing them and
people who

352
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,999
are ill so very clear it sounds
to me

353
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,999
like he's talking
scientifically this

354
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,999
just makes no sense by the way
have some

355
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,999
hair that's cut off your head
fall in

356
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,999
between your mask and your face
see how

357
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,999
that feels is very very is a
shitty

358
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,999
experience so now we have April
3rd so

359
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,999
that's still a month ago here's
Judy on

360
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,999
PBS asking Pope Falchi about
the masks

361
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,999
again masks oh by the way
that's my eye

362
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,999
so candidate masks we are told
that the

363
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,999
Trump administration is on the
verge of

364
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,999
urging Americans to wear masks
when they

365
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,999
go out tell us about the
thinking on

366
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,999
that because just a few days
ago we were

367
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,999
told that the thinking was that
was not

368
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,999
necessary 

369
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,999
it's a great question Judy into
thinking

370
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,999
yeah I could there's no way to
edit

371
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,999
anything in after that great
question

372
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,999
that the thinking was it was not

373
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,999
necessary it's a great question
Judy and

374
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,999
the thinking is really now
influenced by

375
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,999
information that's coming in
and the

376
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,999
information is that more and
more

377
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,999
accumulation of data indicate
that

378
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,999
people who are without symptoms
at all

379
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,999
can transmit the virus but
importantly

380
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,999
they can do it merely by
speaking now

381
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,999
this I I want to see this
report I don't

382
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,999
know what he's referring to but
now you

383
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,999
can transfer it it's before it
was a

384
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,999
droplet maybe highly unlikely
now just

385
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,999
the force of your voice

386
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,999
so there's yeah there was I
just want to

387
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,999
mention that I picked up on this

388
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,999
a couple recent clips I may
even have

389
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,999
one of them I'm not sure
because I

390
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,999
didn't think I didn't think it
was it

391
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,999
was a trend but yeah they're
saying that

392
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,999
talking yeah just this goes
back to your

393
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,999
theory about the mass being
just a

394
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,999
gentle slave muscle it's a
muzzle weasel

395
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,999
you're talking shot

396
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,999
thank you it's a good point
just by

397
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,999
talking you're you're very
dangerous

398
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:33,999
yeah 

399
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,999
muzzle they can do it merely by
speaking

400
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,999
so there's been a recent study
that came

401
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,999
out that said even the force
from your

402
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,999
voice of speaking there is a
degree of

403
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,999
aerosolization namely the virus
can come

404
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,999
out not very far but a few feet
and down

405
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,999
so even though the perfect
solution to

406
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,999
this is if everyone at all
times it's

407
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,999
day six feet separated so in
all the

408
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,999
years in 35 years of of
infectious

409
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,999
diseases and viruses now all of
a sudden

410
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,999
this one is different than all
the rest

411
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,999
we're just the force of your
voice can

412
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,999
go out a few feet and down and
it can

413
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,999
kill people

414
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,999
it's just I'm surprised
sometimes

415
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,999
because the genius virus has
never

416
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,999
spoken to an Arab at a Lebanese
fish

417
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,999
market no well they spit on you
stay six

418
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,999
feet separated from another
person but

419
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,999
as you correctly mentioned this
is not

420
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,999
always feasible there are times
when you

421
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,999
have to do necessary functions
you have

422
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,999
to get food you have to get
drugs from

423
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,999
the pharmacy and you might
inadvertently

424
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,999
be in a situation where you're
close

425
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,999
enough where that kind of
transmission

426
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,999
can take place but and
importantly I

427
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,999
think what people don't fully
appreciate

428
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,999
is that putting a mask on
yourself is

429
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,999
more to prevent you from
infecting

430
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:02,999
someone else

431
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,999
all right so but it's still not
a legal

432
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,999
requirement it's not something
you have

433
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,999
to do by law and why well
because

434
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,999
unfortunately we can't throw
people in

435
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,999
jail and the same question
about masks

436
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,999
that I was asking about staying
at home

437
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,999
if these are things that that
save lives

438
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,999
keep people

439
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,999
healthy why not require them to
do this

440
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,999
you know Judy I understand
where you're

441
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,999
coming from but it becomes
difficult

442
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,999
when you say required by what
by penalty

443
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,999
by putting people in jail I
mean that

444
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,999
becomes a you know something
that really

445
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,999
could be counterproductive in
the

446
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,999
society that we live in and in
America

447
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,999
perhaps you might be able to do
that in

448
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,999
China he says he doesn't say
well if you

449
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,999
want that kind of crazy you got
to go to

450
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,999
China that's where they force
the people

451
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,999
to do stuff no he's saying you
got to be

452
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,999
China if you want that just
wink-wink

453
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,999
nudge-nudge you might be able
to do that

454
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,999
in China but I think it would be

455
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,999
difficult to do it here so what
we're

456
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,999
relying on is two people to
really

457
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,999
understand the importance of
this yes

458
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,999
and the importance indeed I saw
after

459
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,999
the the hair hairdresser on the
way home

460
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,999
I'm like I'm hungry I'm gonna
get me a

461
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,999
sausage biscuit yeah and a hash
brown at

462
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,999
McDonald's in the drive-through
and this

463
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,999
was my experience because the

464
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,999
order-taker 

465
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,999
who already you know they have
the

466
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,999
headset with the microphone

467
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,999
she had a mask on she had a
mascot I

468
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,999
like could I have a sausage
biscuit it

469
00:20:42,000 --> 00:21:00,999
what yeah I'll have a dr.
pepper oh my

470
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,999
goodness so of this I so masks
friend of

471
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,999
show I think it's boring but I
don't

472
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,999
have anything to get people
this so I

473
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,999
don't relish this you you have
you have

474
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,999
you have no standing if you
have nothing

475
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,999
to compete with none can't tell
me my

476
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,999
shits boards okay all right
let's say

477
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,999
what do you got with a no I
this is back

478
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,999
to the idea this is the
original idea

479
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,999
and I think this is more
important than

480
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,999
the a lot of this especially
throwing

481
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,999
people in jail part although I
do like

482
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,999
the bit you should

483
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,999
bit of the person we're gonna
marry and

484
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,999
by the way they're isolated
anyway there

485
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,999
are over by themselves the
people that

486
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,999
are on the McDonald's
microphone but

487
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,999
okay this is a me are talking
about a

488
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,999
big con fad going on and there
was Trump

489
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,999
had one of these two with the
governor

490
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,999
of Nebraska and the governor of
Colorado

491
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,999
and and just that you went
pulled the

492
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,999
camera back at two sides of the
room the

493
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,999
Colorado governor's wearing a
mask and

494
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,999
his assistant was there all
wearing

495
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,999
masks on one side and the other
side the

496
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,999
the Republicans from Nebraska
weren't

497
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,999
and Amy notices this elsewhere
and it's

498
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,999
it's becoming a thing
Republican Rand

499
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,999
Paul of Kentucky the first is
this the

500
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,999
one confab is that what you
want cuz I

501
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,999
have to know what the one is
right the

502
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,999
top it says Amy Rapp mass
affection

503
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,999
because you mentioned confab
that's why

504
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,999
here we go well we're gonna
start today

505
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,999
in Washington DC as president
Trump

506
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,999
claims the u.s. is prayer to
prepare to

507
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,999
transition to greatness and the
Kovach

508
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,999
19 death toll surpasses eighty
one

509
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,999
thousand two of the nation's top

510
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,999
scientists told a Senate
committee

511
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,999
Tuesday that needless death
would result

512
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,999
if states reopened too soon the
stark

513
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,999
warning from the nation's top
infectious

514
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,999
disease expert dr. Anthony
Fauci and dr.

515
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,999
Robert Redfield the director of
the

516
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,999
Centers for Disease Control and

517
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,999
Prevention came just a day
after NBC

518
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,999
News published an unreleased
White House

519
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,999
report showing a surge of
coronavirus

520
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,999
cases and US communities okay
now we

521
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,999
have to watch out for this word
because

522
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,999
now they're just throwing it in
anywhere

523
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,999
they want and what is what is
the

524
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,999
definition of a surge is it a
number if

525
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,999
you have one case in your
county and

526
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,999
then you have to a sudden
powerful

527
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,999
forward or upward movement
especially by

528
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,999
a crowd or by natural force

529
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,999
that's to be a more than
including

530
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,999
Nashville Tennessee in Des
Moines Iowa

531
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,999
Central City Kentucky topped
the list

532
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,999
the report based on a May 7th
internal

533
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,999
memo directly contradicts
Trump's claim

534
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,999
Monday that the number of kovat
19 cases

535
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,999
is rapidly declining around the
country

536
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,999
in a surreal scene

537
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,999
dr. pouchy dr. cereal and food
and drugs

538
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,999
commissioner dr. Stephen Hahn
all joined

539
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,999
the Senate Health Committee
remotely

540
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,999
while they quarantine after
being

541
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,999
exposed to the virus or to a
staffer at

542
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,999
the White House who tested
positive

543
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,999
Republican senator Lamar
Alexander from

544
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,999
Tennessee was also in
quarantine after

545
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,999
his staffer tested positive he
presided

546
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,999
over the hearing from his home
of the

547
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,999
Senators who joined the hearing
in

548
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,999
person 

549
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,999
most Democrats wore masks or
balaclavas

550
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,999
most Republicans did not wear
masks can

551
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,999
Senator Susan Collins of Maine
began the

552
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,999
hearing without a mask but put
one on

553
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,999
during Republican senator dr.
Rand Paul

554
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,999
of Kentucky the first senator
known to

555
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,999
test positive for the virus did
not wear

556
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,999
a mask this is so important for
her oh

557
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,999
yeah well the mask didn't wear
a mask

558
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,999
and he was exploding here you
know had

559
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,999
tested positive and they make
it you're

560
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,999
right it's just a shaming all
that this

561
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,999
is to get this is all about
Trump yes

562
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,999
and do you know why or when
when it will

563
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,999
be safe to go outside without a
mask

564
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,999
because I know when there's
going to be

565
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,999
an exact moment that we will
all feel

566
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,999
safe do you have any idea what
that is

567
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,999
nobody bet you do

568
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,999
it's when the soccer mom says
so oh yeah

569
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,999
yeah they should this revealing
didn't

570
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,999
Twitter I think I did I don't
remember

571
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,999
that I just I want to read
something

572
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,999
from Washington Post a buried
lead I

573
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,999
feel and this was one of this
thing come

574
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,999
out Monday

575
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,999
during a taskforce meeting
Wednesday a

576
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,999
heated discussion broke out
between

577
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,999
deborah birx that's the
ambassador

578
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,999
lieutenant colonel general the
physician

579
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,999
who oversees the administrations

580
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,999
coronavirus response and Robert
Redfield

581
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,999
the director of the Centers for
Disease

582
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,999
Control and Prevention Burks
and others

583
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,999
were frustrated with the CDC's

584
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,999
antiquated system for tracking
virus

585
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,999
data which they worried was
inflating

586
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,999
some statistics such as
mortality rate

587
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,999
and case count by as much as 25%

588
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,999
according to four people
present for the

589
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,999
discussion or later briefed on
it which

590
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,999
of course I can't believe this
either

591
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,999
because we can all believe it
in any

592
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,999
case but I'm just reading it to
senior

593
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,999
administration officials said
the

594
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,999
discussion was not heated quote
there is

595
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,999
nothing from the CDC that I can
trust

596
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,999
Burke said according to the -
two of the

597
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,999
people Redfield defended his
agency but

598
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,999
there was general agreement
that the CDC

599
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,999
is in need of a digital upgrade
Oh

600
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,999
that'll fix the problem what do
you need

601
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,999
to do an abacus counting we're
relying

602
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,999
on this data of who dies of
what and

603
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,999
although shootable we've got
more

604
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,999
digital I actually have a
couple of

605
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,999
clips regarding this one foul
she is the

606
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,999
one that's saying well I think
the

607
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,999
numbers are probably a lot
lower than

608
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,999
they really are

609
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,999
I'm sorry he's saying exactly
the

610
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,999
opposite I have he had a hold
testimony

611
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,999
where he said it's probably
double what

612
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,999
it is yes what I said no you
said you

613
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,999
said the opposite he said the
numbers

614
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,999
are much lower say you said
much lower

615
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,999
no I I would move I would ask
you to go

616
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,999
back but foul she says that the
numbers

617
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,999
are I probably put it poorly
you did

618
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,999
pouchy has been saying that the
numbers

619
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,999
are higher than we're reporting
he says

620
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,999
he says he believes it's double
and

621
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,999
other people like you said of
our saying

622
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,999
the opposite including Burke's
who is

623
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,999
foul cheese Burke's well listen
to this

624
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,999
one I got a good one here this
one is

625
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,999
do-do-do-do-do-do papa

626
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,999
like if I find it I've got my
clips are

627
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,999
still not well organized

628
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,999
Rick bright now-no Trump Trump
Trump

629
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,999
this is fun

630
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,999
I'm love hearing you struggles
okay we

631
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,999
got time no one's going anywhere

632
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,999
yeah I can play a little
interlude music

633
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,999
if you'd like while you look
for that oh

634
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,999
well let's do the big concert
but I want

635
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,999
to go back to the Kami clip
first you've

636
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,999
missed a little put his little
gotcha in

637
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,999
there as she had okay she made
the point

638
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,999
if she made a point in that
clip of

639
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,999
saying that the report the
Democrats are

640
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,999
not only wearing masks but they
were

641
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,999
wearing a balaclava sorry I
heard it I

642
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,999
lost even with a lot of love
AHS black

643
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,999
lava whatever high over your
italic lava

644
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,999
yeah what is what what are they
you know

645
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,999
what these things are they're
just like

646
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,999
like a Muslim thing this brings
us back

647
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,999
to sir Imus and his claim that
we're

648
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,999
being turned into above a
Sharia State I

649
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,999
forgot about that yeah yeah
balaclava

650
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,999
there's well a balaclava to me
just

651
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,999
looks like just some kind of
kerchief

652
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,999
well if you look it up it's
there are

653
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,999
the full face once and cover
your whole

654
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,999
ass right right the ones that
could be

655
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,999
printed with that's interesting
because

656
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,999
I don't think a single person
was

657
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,999
wearing an actual balaclava
you're right

658
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,999
that's not true at the meeting
with

659
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,999
Trump and the Colorado Governor
his

660
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,999
health director was well a
balaclava the

661
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,999
definition is a close-fitting
garment

662
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,999
covering the whole head and
neck except

663
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,999
for parts of the face so what
he would

664
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,999
have to go over your face over
your head

665
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,999
and you have the eyes in the
mouth open

666
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,999
it's also seen in

667
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,999
any clubs in Amsterdam this
outfit funny

668
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,999
I found your a clip it's a desk

669
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,999
exaggerated over desig Zaheer's
now this

670
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,999
is a classic role we have to
point out

671
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,999
Illinois zone state health
director who

672
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,999
had a recent second this is
your buddy

673
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,999
Laura Ingraham and I have a few
clips

674
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,999
from her but she I believe she
actually

675
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,999
says Illinois's troll we have
to point

676
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,999
out Illinois own state health
director

677
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,999
who at a recent press
conference just

678
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,999
casually admitted this if you
were in

679
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,999
hospice and had already been
given you

680
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,999
know a few weeks to live and
then you

681
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,999
also were found to have kovat
that would

682
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,999
be counted as a Cova death even
if you

683
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,999
died of a clear alternate cause
but you

684
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,999
had kovat at the same time it's
still

685
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,999
listed as a Cova death

686
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,999
yeah well this story of course
has been

687
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,999
told a thousand times on a
thousand

688
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,999
YouTube videos by a thousand
doctors

689
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,999
this is the consistent story
everyone

690
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,999
knows is very consistent fact
those two

691
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,999
doctors that were taken down
they was

692
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,999
that word same thing would
taken down by

693
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,999
YouTube mm-hmm discussed this
in great

694
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,999
detail but it just keeps coming
up yes

695
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,999
and except out she right now
she says

696
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,999
the opposite is true

697
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,999
yeah foul she says it's
probably double

698
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,999
then he said that in testimony
and

699
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,999
that's when everyone went

Rand Paul

704
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,999
I put Ron Paul because it was
late okay

705
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,999

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,999
acute up let me see is it is it
the

707
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,999
testimony that you have or I
don't have

708
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,999
the testimony no I have him
discussing I

709
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,999
believe with Judy or one of the
yeah oh

710
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,999
oh oh how about this why don't
I play

711
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,999
what he said in the Senate Rand
Paul and

712
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,999
then we'll go to what he said
at Judy

713
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,999
how's that sound

714
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,999
if it's good if it's related
yeah

715
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,999
it's about the the schools and
about

716
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,999
getting back to life no I think
he's

717
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,999
just didn't he is just moaning
hold on

718
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,999
let's listen to this with
regard to

719
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,999
going back to school

720
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,999
none thing that was left out of
that

721
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,999
discussion and she probably
mentioned

722
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,999
that Rand Paul I think he's a
physician

723
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,999
is the ophthalmologist what
he's a

724
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,999
physician believe he's an

725
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,999
ophthalmologist yes but he's
still a

726
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,999
doctor is the doctors the
doctors an MD

727
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,999
is mortality I mean shouldn't
we at

728
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,999
least be discussed part of this
weighs

729
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,999
more MD than Ted Ross that's
for sure

730
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,999
going back to school

731
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,999
one thing that was left out of
that

732
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,999
discussion is mortality I mean
shouldn't

733
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,999
we at least be discussing what
the

734
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,999
mortality of children is this
is for

735
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,999
doctor Falchi as well you know
the

736
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,999
mortality between 0 and 18 in
New York

737
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,999
data approaches zero it's not
gonna be

738
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,999
absolutely zero but it almost
approaches

739
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,999
zero between 18 and 45 the
mortality in

740
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,999
New York was 10 out of a hundred

741
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,999
thousand so really we do need
to be

742
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,999
thinking about that we need to
observe

743
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,999
with an open mind what went on
in Sweden

744
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,999
where the kids kept going to
school the

745
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,999
mortality per capita in Sweden
is

746
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,999
actually less than France less
than

747
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,999
Italy less in Spain less than
Belgium

748
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,999
less than the Netherlands about
the same

749
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,999
as Switzerland

750
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,999
god bless the Swedes man god
bless you

751
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,999
thank you for - which Eleni
mentioned

752
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,999
anybody did Sweden these as
Sweden's the

753
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,999
one that stayed open and I say
God bless

754
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,999
Sweden god bless them for doing
that

755
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,999
otherwise we'd have no other
proof but

756
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,999
basically I don't think there's
anybody

757
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,999
arguing that what happened in
Sweden is

758
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,999
an unacceptable result I think
people

759
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,999
are intrigued by it and we
should be I

760
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,999
don't think any of us are
certain when

761
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,999
we do all these modeling's
there's been

762
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,999
more people wrong with
modelling than

763
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,999
right we're opening up a lot of

764
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,999
economies around the around the
US and I

765
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,999
hope that people who are
predicting doom

766
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,999
and gloom and saying oh we
can't do this

767
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,999
is going to be surged to admit
that they

768
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,999
were wrong if there isn't a
surge

769
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,999
because I think that's what's
going to

770
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,999
happen in rural States we never
really

771
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,999
reached any sort of pandemic
levels in

772
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,999
Kentucky and other states we
have less

773
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,999
deaths in Kentucky that we have
in us in

774
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,999
an average flu season it's not
to say

775
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,999
this isn't deadly but really
outside of

776
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,999
New England we've had a real

777
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,999
Tivoli benign course for this
virus

778
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,999
nationwide and I think the

779
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,999
one-size-fits-all that we're
gonna have

780
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,999
a national strategy and
nobody's gonna

781
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,999
go to school is kind of
ridiculous we

782
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,999
really ought to be doing at
school

783
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,999
district by school district and
the

784
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,999
power needs to be dispersed
because

785
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,999
people make wrong predictions
and really

786
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,999
the history of this when we
look back

787
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,999
will be a wrong prediction
after wrong

788
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,999
prediction after wrong
prediction

789
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,999
starting with Ferguson in
England so I

790
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,999
think we ought to have a little
bit of

791
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,999
humility in our belief that we
know

792
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,999
what's best for the economy and
as much

793
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,999
as I respect you dr. Falchi I
don't

794
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,999
think you're the end whole I
don't think

795
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,999
you're the one person that gets
to make

796
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,999
a decision we can listen to
your advice

797
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,999
but there are people on the
other side

798
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,999
saying there's not going to be
a surge

799
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,999
and that we can safely open the
economy

800
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,999
and the facts will to bear this
out but

801
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,999
if we keep kids out of school
for

802
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,999
another year what's gonna
happen is the

803
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,999
poor and underprivileged kids
who don't

804
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,999
have a parent that's able to
teach them

805
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,999
at home are not gonna learn for
a full

806
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,999
year and I think we got to look
at the

807
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,999
Swedish model and we got to
look at

808
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,999
letting our kids get back to
school I

809
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,999
think it's a huge mistake if we
don't

810
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,999
open the schools in the fall so
foul she

811
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,999
is is obviously being worshipped

812
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,999
certainly by elements in the
media and

813
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,999
politicians and he's
untouchable no

814
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,999
matter how many times he
contradicts

815
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,999
himself or said it was no big
deal and I

816
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,999
think you got some clips coming
up

817
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,999
there's one thing I wanted to
mention

818
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,999
about fout she when now when
when we

819
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,999
were looking well when the
Vatican was

820
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,999
looking for a new pope I
predicted this

821
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,999
Pope by name and I want to tell
you and

822
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,999
I think I explained how I did
that but I

823
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,999
did it by looking for - well
really for

824
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,999
looking for one thing I knew
was gonna

825
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,999
be some priest from South
America and I

826
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,999
knew it had to be a New World
Order guy

827
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,999
because I am a firm believer
that the

828
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,999
last real Pope was Pope John
Paul the

829
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,999
first to by the way was
eliminated after

830
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,999
exactly 33 days on on his papal
throne

831
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,999
one of those magic numbers that
were

832
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,999
always wary of yeah he was he
that was

833
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,999
possessed you what the
godfather 3 movie

834
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,999
was about yeah fascination of a
pope

835
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,999
right well I think he was he
was the

836
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,999
real deal and then they had to
get some

837
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,999
of these New World Order guys

838
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,999
and then I saw that the Frances
that he

839
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,999
is a Jesuit now I only know one
Jesuit I

840
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,999
mean really no not well not
really

841
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,999
really no but I know him well
enough and

842
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,999
that's the Padre from twit and
looking

843
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,999
at his psychological profile
which i

844
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,999
think is representative of the
of the

845
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,999
Jesuit model is that of well
unwanted

846
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,999
submission to control and
there's also a

847
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,999
lot of historical stuff about
the

848
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,999
Jesuits and Freemasonry and
before you

849
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,999
know it you're down the rabbit
hole of

850
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,999
Illuminati but it turns out
foul she's

851
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,999
also a Jesuit and then it kind
of comes

852
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,999
together 

853
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,999
you've got the Pope he's
sitting there

854
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,999
in the Vatican with his
billion-dollar

855
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,999
empire and here's foutch II
sitting

856
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,999
there at NIH with this
billion-dollar

857
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,999
empire telling people what to
do I think

858
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,999
he has a bit of a god complex
and it's

859
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,999
being played into if not a much
deeper

860
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,999
agenda yes an interesting point
I didn't

861
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,999
know he was a Jesuit no I'd
only found

862
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,999
out myself just a couple days
ago Mike

863
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,999
oh that's interesting I really
don't hey

864
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,999
if you're a Jesuit sitting at
home and

865
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,999
you're mad at me then let me
know what's

866
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,999
going lately I'm sure we have a
number

867
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,999
of Jesuits listen to the show
because

868
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:04,999
they have to exactly yeah but
now she

869
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,999
mentioned Sweden I want to
bring up a

870
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,999
laura ingraham ham clip because
this is

871
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,999
I when she did this she's doing
this new

872
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,999

would when she did this little
little

878
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,999
little bit these are all short

00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,999
to myself besides thinking
about Sweden

clip and now onto the frauds
what

884
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,999
start with Pennsylvania Health
Secretary

885
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,999
Rachel Levine who weeks ago
ordered

886
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,999
nursing homes to admit kovat
positive

887
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,999
patients 

888
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,999
well while thousands of
residents saw

889
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,999
their loved ones and family
members die

890
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,999
Levine quietly extracted her
own mother

891
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,999
out of harm's way

892
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,999
reportedly moving her from a
nursing

893
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,999
home to a hotel

894
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,999
my mother requested and my
sister and I

895
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,999
as her children complied to
move her to

896
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,999
another location during the
kovat 19

897
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,999
outbreak my mother is 95 years
old she

898
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,999
is very intelligent and more
than

899
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,999
competent to make her own
decision I'd

900
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,999
rather have her mother be health

901
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,999
secretary of Pennsylvania

00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,999

pennsylvania health secretary

915
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,999
a very strange-looking person
she's a

916
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,999
kind of a squat fat woman with
a long

917
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,999
gray scraggly hair and she's
talks and

918
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,999
sounds and then if you listen

919
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,999
clip I don't believe it if you
look back

920
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,999
on it you'd think it was a
woman at all

921
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,999

00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,999
the voice of this woman is just
just a

00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,999
head shaker oh okay this is

00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,999

it again listen to do okay with
I don't

931
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,999
even need to play it again
let's start

932
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,999
with Pennsylvania Health
Secretary

933
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,999
Rachel Levine who weeks ago
ordered

934
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,999
nursing homes to admit kovat
positive

935
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,999
patients well while

936
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,999
the residents saw their loved
ones and

937
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,999
family members die

938
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,999
Levine quietly extracted her
own mother

939
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,999
out of harm's way reportedly
moving her

940
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,999
from a nursing home to a hotel

941
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,999
my mother requested and my
sister and I

942
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,999
as her children complied to
move her to

943
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,999
another location obviously yeah
well

944
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,999
okay that's an observation I
don't know

945
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,999
if it's off-putting

946
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,999
all right now here here she is
talking

947
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,999
about this is the story that I
did

948
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,999
nobody's gonna want to cover
apparently

949
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,999
if it's and if it's true but
this is the

950
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,999
Florida in Georgia clip no you
don't

951
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,999
want to talk about those
elderly homes

952
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,999
for a minute you want to go
straight

953
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,999
through the Florida and Georgia

954
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,999
well I all I was interested in
is the

955
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,999
business act that they would
that this

956
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,999
ninety five year old woman was
moved out

957
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,999
of the home when they moved all
the

958
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,999
covert people and it's just
kind of well

959
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,999
no this is this talk about this
is it's

960
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,999
a sick situation I don't
understand

961
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,999
what's very this is very
important to

962
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,999
stop this is the this is the
problem so

963
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,999
first of all it's not discussed
because

964
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,999
if it's brought up and really
you delve

965
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,999
into it you will find that
Governor

966
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,999
Cuomo made a mistake yes and at
the end

967
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,999
of March ordered sick people
kovat 19

968
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,999
patients to be put temporarily
in

969
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,999
nursing homes and homes for the
elderly

970
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,999
and allowed for kovat 19
positive staff

971
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,999
to continue working in nursing
homes

972
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,999
that means he lent him to be
president

973
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,999
but okay so let me just let me
just

974
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,999
break this down for a second
this is

975
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,999
obviously now that we have the
numbers

976
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,999
and it turns out that over
sixty percent

977
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,999
of all infections took place in
the home

978
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,999
and over fifty percent in New
York of

979
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,999
the deaths are in nursing homes
so I'm

980
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,999
sure that Cuomo or whoever made
this

981
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,999
decision is not an evil bastard
and it

982
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,999
was a mistake if someone was not

983
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,999
thinking probably because they
were

984
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,999
completely obsessed and
preoccupied with

985
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,999
the surge and the hospital
system and

986
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,999
this killed people and it has
to be

987
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,999
admitted if someone has to say
you know

988
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,999
what we made a really big
mistake here

989
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,999
and we learned

990
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,999
but the in the United States in

991
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,999
particular but look at Italy
every other

992
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,999
country it's people over 75 and
mainly

993
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,999
those who are in in this case
state-run

994
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,999
care said we don't give a shit
about the

995
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,999
elderly in the United States we
don't

996
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,999
care about them let me get this
straight

997
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,999
would your advocating is that
somebody

998
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,999
admitted to making a mistake

999
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,999
you have to because people are
in

1000
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,999
artesia society like this
somebody's

1001
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,999
gonna make it you're gonna make
a

1002
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,999
statement like that if it if so
if no

1003
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,999
one makes the statement then
what will

1004
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,999
happen is there will be
lawsuits is

1005
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,999
gonna be a horrible that may
happen

1006
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:51,999
anyway 

1007
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,999
but we all for the death toll
in general

1008
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,999
we have all these people dead
whether

1009
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,999
it's legitimate count or not
it's

1010
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,999
important for us to understand
it's not

1011
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,999
children and it's mainly people
the

1012
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,999
majority of people who died
were elderly

1013
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,999
in Khitan in nursing care
facilities who

1014
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,999
by the way shared it with kovat
19

1015
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,999
positive patients and staff
that would

1016
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,999
help people understand this put
forth

1017
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,999
how does this put forth the
bite in

1018
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,999
Democrat agenda no I'm not I'm
speaking

1019
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,999
as a human being I'm not
speaking as a

1020
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,999
media analyst I'm speaking as
someone

1021
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,999
who says that this will not fly
you have

1022
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,999
to admit the mistake and
because we know

1023
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,999
it already the information is
out there

1024
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,999
and no one's gonna take anything

1025
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,999
seriously and and I'm sorry

1026
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,999
Cuomo or each team made a
horrible

1027
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,999
mistake and we have to
acknowledge it

1028
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,999
and move on and mark it down as

1029
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,999
something we won't do in the
future

1030
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,999
right next to don't open up the
Hair

1031
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,999
Salons 48 hours before they
know I mean

1032
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,999
come on this is this is a
learning

1033
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,999
moment I'm sorry people died
this

1034
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,999
doesn't help the Trump clock
that's

1035
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,999
gotta go well that's really
this is

1036
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,999
really sick then

1037
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,999
oh so what so what you're
saying is in

1038
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,999
order to get a Trump I can now
deduce

1039
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,999
this just what you are implying
is Trump

1040
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,999
is hated so much we have to up
the

1041
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,999
people dead who do we have um
fuck it

you're

1044
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,999
saying yeah

1048
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,999
being facetious you don't
really think

1049
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,999
that's true

1050
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,999

skeptical Wow I know nobody
pologize and

1052
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,999
that's not gonna happen but
it's also

1053
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,999
good to know that most people
really are

1054
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,999
not at a huge risk of dying it's

1055

infected

1065
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,999
eyelid and then the runny nose
and then

1066
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,999

me the rona so of course the
eye passes

1070
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,999
but then last night what it's
like after

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,999
dinners like 7:15 7:30 and
we're outside

00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,999
drinking a coffee and all of a
sudden my

1073
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,999
nose starts running like crazy

against that for the power
suggestion ID

1077
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,999
I thought to myself what would
jcd do so

1078
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,999
I immediately went and grabbed
fifty

1079
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,999
fifty thousand mega mega Bork's
of

1080
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,999
vitamin D Tamara that shit down

1081
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,999

nose so

1082
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,999
I don't know what

1083
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,999
but I feel good could have been
they

1084
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,999
might have been right it's a
good thing

1085
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,999
you jumped on the d3i

1086

it WWJ CD came we came right
right you

1087
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,999
got a doctor

1088
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,999
you are not a doctor but I was
very

1089
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,999
happy very happy it is there I
think I

1090
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,999
had to say I had a similar not
a eyeball

1091
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,999
thing followed by that but I
thought I

1092
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,999
could was catching something
during the

1093
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,999
era that JC buzzkill jr. had he
did have

1094
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:51,999
it 

1095
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,999
and apparently Jesse had a
diversion

1096
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,999
where you lost your sense of
smell yes

1097
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,999
I've heard that heard this too
during

1098
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,999
that little period I was
catching

1099
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,999
something and it was like that
this is a

1100
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,999
dis and it was weird too it
wasn't like

1101
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,999
the normal kind of like oh I
think I'm

1102
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,999
getting a cold I'm getting the
flu or

1103
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,999
something and I just said I'm
just

1104
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,999
taking the DI / - take some d3
and it

1105
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,999
was going that was the end of
that and

1106
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,999
it was all over we'll see the
it down

1107
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,999
the road if you have antibodies
anyway

1108
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,999
let's go - ok I think we're
over with

1109
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,999
that load segment let's talk
with about

1110
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,999
the Florida and Georgia thing
which is

1111
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,999
what I wanted to discuss him it

1112
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,999
initially yeah that was the
initial idea

1113
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,999
the two states that opened up
first

1114
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,999
Florida and Georgia both are
continuing

1115
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,999
to see declines and kovat
infections

1116
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,999
while shocking the liberal
haters but

1117
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,999
not to you because we told you
that the

1118
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,999
virus was probably weakening
and that

1119
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,999
people would innovate to stay
safe

1120
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,999
innovate wow she's mean I don't
know

1121
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,999
what she means you know
innovating is

1122
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,999
six feet apart or who knows
whatever how

1123
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,999
in the case nobody is
discussing the the

1124
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,999
you know it that went Georgian
more than

1125
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,999
Florida yes they they were they
busted

1126
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,999
wide open so what's going on

1127
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,999
everything's fine and everybody
jumped

1128
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,999
all over him said the Republican

1129
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,999
governor cuz you know Stacey
Abrams

1130
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,999
wouldn't have done this no lost
up in

1131
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,999
the Bay State yeah I mean the
basement

1132
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,999
you'd be still yeah a Stacey
Abrams

1133
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,999
would never make a mistake like
that but

1134
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,999
otherwise I guess it's just
fabulous

1135
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,999
then well well the whole this
is just as

1136
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,999
getting more enjoy the promises
now

1137
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,999
this is a new world order I you
knowed

1138
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,999
amazing Polly found some
documents

1139
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,999
saying this whole thing was a
test

1140
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,999
[Music] 

1141
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,999
mazing paulien is amazing so
amazing

1142
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,999
Polly does this thing and it's
and by

1143
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:55,999
the way if you got the last
news there's

1144
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,999
a link in there still up it
won't be up

1145
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,999
forever no because the people
see this

1146
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,999
and they there's nothing in
there that's

1147
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,999
inaccurate she's just taking
from

1148
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,999
professional documents you know
and

1149
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,999
showing them and but they find
ways to

1150
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,999
go oh no no this is bad it's a
bad

1151
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,999
influence on the done the
youngins or

1152
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,999
something I don't know why they
take her

1153
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,999
down well the beauty of it all
is that

1154
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,999
in certainly in the United
States not so

1155
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:19,999
in other countries but in the
United

1156
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,999
States it is all voluntary I
mean we

1157
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,999
have a court case after court
cases

1158
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,999
being struck down against
people are

1159
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,999
being arrested etc so it is
really up to

1160
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,999
us and and that's it's actually
much

1161
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,999
bigger and much more
frightening to me

1162
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,999
that we have this social
control of

1163
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,999
shaming shaming yeah it truly
is shaming

1164
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:43,999
let me just just because we're
still on

1165
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,999
opening up and stuff I have two
clips

1166
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,999
about California because it's
very

1167
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,999
confusing 

1168
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,999
is California open is a closed
mayor

1169
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,999
Garcetti the Garcetti of Los
Angeles

1170
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,999
County has extended these stay
at home

1171
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,999
order through August but what
does that

1172
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,999
mean but it's not would they
stay at

1173
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,999
home orders they know you're
top health

1174
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,999
officials said yes they expect
us to

1175
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,999
extend the orders for another
three

1176
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,999
months but explain exactly what
that

1177
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,999
means sure I think we have to
all

1178
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,999
recognize that we're not moving
to earn

1179
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,999
cope at 19 we're learning to
live with

1180
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,999
it 

1181
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,999
it's important not to overreact
but it's

1182
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,999
important to take this serious
because

1183
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,999
it is as dangerous today as it
was the

1184
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,999
first day that it arrived in
our cities

1185
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,999
in our country so quite frankly
there's

1186
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,999
no so-called open state or open
country

1187
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,999
that doesn't continue to have
health

1188
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,999
orders telling us to cover our
faces

1189
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,999
physically distance and to tell
people

1190
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,999
that your safest working from
and

1191
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,999
staying at home that's all that
the

1192
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,999
County Health Director was
saying and we

1193
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,999
can't expect that to disappear
in a

1194
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,999
matter of weeks or even a few
months

1195
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,999
the same time we're learning a
lot of

1196
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,999
really important lessons about
how to

1197
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,999
safely reopen sectors and
places and we

1198
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:55,999
have to assess each of those
steps give

1199
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,999
three or four weeks time to see
is there

1200
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,999
any additional spread are we
endangering

1201
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,999
more people and how can we keep
our most

1202
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,999
vulnerable safe so we are
learning to

1203
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,999
live with it at the same moment
that we

1204
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,999
are also learning the lessons
of how to

1205
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,999
do this so I believe that that
he also

1206
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,999
recognizes he has absolutely no
power to

1207
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,999
tell people or to keep people
at home

1208
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,999
they're just using new world
order terms

1209
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,999
now stay at home order doesn't
mean you

1210
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,999
have to stay at home because
they can't

1211
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,999
actually enforce it it's a
trick it's a

1212
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,999
mind-control well we're
learning to deal

1213
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,999
with it stay at home you know
it's

1214
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:33,999
learning to deal with it we're
learning

1215
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,999
here know you're mind
controlling people

1216
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,999
into feeling unsafe and afraid
of other

1217
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,999
people and so the restaurants
like Texas

1218
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,999
open up with spread out and I
think it's

1219
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,999
25% capacity max for the next

1220
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,999
foreseeable whatever and then in

1221
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,999
California I will say here's
some of

1222
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,999
your innovation all right what
do we got

1223
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,999
here we've got oh look at look
at this

1224
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,999
look closely at this that's a
restaurant

1225
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,999
that's using mannequins to fill
out the

1226
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,999
half-empty dining room what's
the story

1227
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,999
behind this one ash because it
looks so

1228
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,999
crappy they're putting
mannequins at the

1229
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,999
other table so the restaurant
looks more

1230
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,999
fun and full instead of actual
people

1231
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,999
smoke and mirrors out there
la-la-land

1232
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,999
Wow yeah yeah so it's what's
got that

1233
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,999
kind of money those things
aren't cheap

1234
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,999
those good mannequins who's got
it you

1235
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,999
can't you can't run a
restaurant at 25%

1236
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,999
capacity you can't run it at 50
literacy

1237
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,999
you can't run it you can't it's
crazy

1238
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,999
what you don't the shaming
thing let's

1239
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,999
get back to the shaming okay
this is

1240
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,999
interesting it's just like the
whole

1241
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,999
thing it's like there and it's
the

1242
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,999
Democrats that are the shamers
cuz the

1243
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:53,999
Democrats to the streamers
let's just be

1244
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,999
honest about it

1245
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,999
no no but even Johanna was she

1246
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,999
recognized that and setage is
I'd never

1247
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,999
expected this kind of shaming
from

1248
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,999
liberals shame shame shame on
you

1249
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,999
yeah which of course ventually
show

1250
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,999
tries to become shame on you
for voting

1251
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,999
for Trump shame on you for
being a

1252
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,999
republic yes if you vote for
Trump

1253
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,999
you're voting for the virus you
vote for

1254
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,999
Democrats strategy all over
that meme

1255
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:32,999
vote for Trump is a vote for
the virus

1256
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,999
gentlemen that was $100,000
idea and two

1257
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,999
points of all the media Buy

1258
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,999
damn it damn it damn it damn it
should

1259
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,999
have known better

1260
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,999
so what is going to what's
weird because

1261
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,999
the testing is now has been
kind of it's

1262
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,999
not really in the conversation
at the

1263
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,999
moment it's going to glide well
now it

1264
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,999
not not the way it was but it's
going to

1265
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,999
come roaring back because China
just

1266
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,999
made their move I think I think
this is

1267
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,999
a move against Trump and Shi
Jing P says

1268
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,999
the CCP will be testing 14
million

1269
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,999
people in Wuhan in ten days time

1270
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,999
fourteen million drop has been
showing

1271
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,999
this chart

1272
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,999
oh yeah not that this is an
information

1273
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,999
war and China is saying huh
look at you

1274
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,999
with your stupid orange man
over there

1275
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,999
we're going to test fourteen
million

1276
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,999
people in Wuhan

1277
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,999
in ten days which means you've
got about

1278
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,999
15 the FF that's 900 tests a
minute for

1279
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,999
24 hours a day for 10 days so I
don't

1280
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,999
know what kind of army and if
they're

1281
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,999
gonna go into people's homes
and rouse

1282
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,999
to them or how they're gonna
get that

1283
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,999
done in 10 days stick a probe
up them

1284
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,999
but but the whole but this
whole thing

1285
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,999
is isn't it I don't think it's
true it

1286
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,999
may well be but I'd be
surprised it's to

1287
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,999
make China look like they're
that

1288
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,999
they're the boss they're doing
it the

1289
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,999
best way this is the way to go
world

1290
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,999
health world health
organization we know

1291
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,999
what's up Trump bad bad bad bad
it's not

1292
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:25,999
going to end with this testing
which is

1293
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,999
it's like the ultimate we
cannot go back

1294
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,999
to work we cannot fully
function until

1295
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,999
we test everybody every day
five times a

1296
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,999
day and we had a vaccine huh
the irony

1297
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,999
that the testing is the obvious
which is

1298
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,999
that the more you test the more
cases

1299
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,999
you uncover because most people
don't

1300
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,999
have symptoms and never will
yeah so you

1301
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,999
have and so that makes the
numbers go up

1302
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,999
and then that numbers go up and
makes

1303
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,999
you need for more testing which
means

1304
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,999
the numbers go up even more and
then we

1305
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,999
got to stay at home longer cuz
there's

1306
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,999
more numbers as sewers to surge
there's

1307
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,999
more cases what are we gonna do
we're

1308
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,999
all gonna die I'd like to do a
quick

1309
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,999
review of the three trillion
dollar

1310
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,999
package that the Democrat Party

1311
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,999
announced to be discussed be
we're

1312
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,999
always introduced into the
house because

1313
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,999
I read it it wasn't hard to do
because I

1314
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,999
well okay I want you can you do
that

1315
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,999
after I give to play two clips
namely

1316
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,999
Amy's take on it yeah
definitely Trump's

1317
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,999
a rebuttal yeah definitely okay
where

1318
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,999
are we well I guess it's just
not my day

1319
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,999
but this

1320
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,999
let's try the big confab maybe
that's

1321
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,999
the one that's got the stuff
about the

1322
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,999

Kentucky

Capitol Hill House Democratic

have unveiled

1329
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,999
don't be so damn creative with
your

1330
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,999
titles because it's messing up
the

1331
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:10,999
workflow to war loser relief
bill

1332
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,999

there on

1334
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,999
Capitol Hill House Democratic
leaders

1335
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,999
have unveiled a massive
eighteen hundred

1336
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,999
page coronavirus relief package

three trillion dollars the
so-called

1338
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,999
heroes Act would fund expanded

1339
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,999
unemployment benefits through
January

1340
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,999
2021 send most US adults another

00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,999
one-time twelve hundred dollar
stimulus

1342
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,999
check and provide one trillion

and assistance to hard-hit
state local

1344
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,999
and tribal governments it would
also

1345
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,999
expand snap food benefits fund
hazard

1346
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,999
pay for frontline workers
increased

1347
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,999
funding for kovat nineteen

1348
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,999
provide twenty five dollars in
funding

1349
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,999
to the u.s. postal service the
bill

1350
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,999
would not expand Medicare to
cover

1351
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,999
millions of newly uninsured
Americans

1352
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,999
nor does it provide for rent and

1353
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,999
mortgage relief or recurring
cash

1354
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,999
payments in US households the
bill would

1355
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,999
expand the paycheck protection
program

1356
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,999
to bail out corporate lobbyists
firms

1357
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,999
climate activists say the bill
fails to

1358
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,999
close loopholes for big
polluters

1359
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,999
Greenpeace USA tweeted quote
fossil fuel

1360
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,999
CEOs will be rejoicing that
Congress has

1361
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,999
once again left the door wide
open for

1362
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,999
handouts to struggling
mismanaged oil

1363
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,999
and gas corporations this was a
slanted

1364
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,999
report as if this bill was a
corrupt

1365
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,999
bill to protect polluters you
know it is

1366
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,999
a crap I just want to respond
to Monday

1367
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,999
Trump's response this is just
one thing

1368
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,999
before it before I forget

1369
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,999
the lobbyist thing IIIi I just
need to I

1370
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,999
just need to because that was I
was I

1371
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,999
said listen to how she reported
that

1372
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,999
because it was it was really
lame what

1373
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,999
she did there hold on provide
for rent

1374
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,999
and mortgage relief or
recurring cash

1375
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,999
payments to US households the
bill would

1376
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,999
expand the Paycheck protection
program

1377
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,999
to bail out corporate lobbyists
firms

1378
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,999
okay so to say that because it
doesn't I

1379
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,999
read this thing to my knowledge

1380
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,999
nowhere in the bill does it say
oh

1381
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,999
here's a special provision for
corporate

1382
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,999
lobbying firms that is not
reporting

1383
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,999
what Amy did there that is

1384
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,999
editorializing because there is
a a joke

1385
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,999
now going around in DC that the
lobbying

1386
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,999
group that represents lobbyists
has said

1387
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,999
they need payroll Protection
Act money

1388
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,999
otherwise they can't help
Washington

1389
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,999
write very bills they're voting
on so

1390
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,999
it's a circular thing that they
want

1391
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,999
they want money from the bill
they

1392
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,999
helped right so they can
continue to

1393
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,999
write bills but there's nothing
in that

1394
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,999
bill that says it's going to
help

1395
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,999
lobbying firms but you yeah so
I don't

1396
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,999
know why because it's really a
slam

1397
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,999
against Pelosi I'm not sure why
why she

1398
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,999
would I would think she would
be all in

1399
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,999
but maybe that's how you make
it seem

1400
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,999
balanced she twist the story in
such a

1401
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,999
way that as though that the
Republicans

1402
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,999
had some input in this doll
their fault

1403
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,999
well believe me the the
Republican Party

1404
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,999
I see on the hill it had no
hand in this

1405
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,999
all right well here's what
Trump this is

1406
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,999
Trump on the Pelosi bill

1407
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,999
it suggests that depends and
certainly

1408
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,999
not the package size so today
basically

1409
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:41,999
if you look at that package
what they

1410
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,999
want more than anything else is
it's a

1411
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,999
voting package they want to be
able to

1412
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,999
make sure that Republicans
can't win an

1413
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,999
election by putting it all
sorts of

1414
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,999
mailing ballots now that's the
problem

1415
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,999
with mail-in ballots are they
going to

1416
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,999
dump a whole pile of ballots on
your

1417
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,999
desk just before the election
so the

1418
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,999
problem with the mail-in
ballots is

1419
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,999
subject to tremendous corruption

1420
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,999
tremendous corruption cheating
so I'm

1421
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,999
against it and if you look at
the bill

1422
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,999
that Nancy Pelosi is putting in
it has a

1423
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,999
lot to do with elections and
then we're

1424
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,999
not gonna we're not gonna lose
elections

1425
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,999
because of that I don't find
that to be

1426
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:20,999
true 

1427
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,999
I don't think Trump's truthful
either I

1428
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,999
mean I went through this bill I
reviewed

1429
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,999
several different reviews of
the bill

1430
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,999
because there's a lot of
legalese is it

1431
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,999
what this is it's really and
it's

1432
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,999
typical it's an omnibus bill so
if they

1433
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:36,999
take a whole bunch of stuff
that's been

1434
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,999
waiting around has been sitting
you know

1435
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,999
it's been in the process been in

1436
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,999
committee it's you know it's
different

1437
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,999
people's important little bills

1438
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,999
it's like sweeping up the mess
and yes

1439
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,999
and they put it all together
into this

1440
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,999
huge bill and therefore it's
disjointed

1441
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,999
the only way it flows together
is by

1442
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,999
continuously saying we're going
to get

1443
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,999
to an example 25 billion
dollars to the

1444
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,999
United States Postal Service to
help

1445
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,999
combat the corona virus in
kovat 19 you

1446
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,999
understand how they do it so
it's just 1

1447
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,999
billion dollars to the No
Agenda show to

1448
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,999
help combat coronavirus in
kovin 19 if

1449
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,999
only so a lot of existing bills
wrapped

1450
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:16,999
into one

1451
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,999
almost every Inspector General
gets a

1452
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,999
little extra an extra budget
usually it

1453
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,999
from a million to several
million so

1454
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,999
that they can accurately have
oversight

1455
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,999
and investigate any misdoings
with the

1456
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,999
money which is meant to
investigate and

1457
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,999
to support and combat the to
combat

1458
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,999
coronavirus and covert 19 a
hundred

1459
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,999
million dollars and by the way
these

1460
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,999
numbers you realize like out a
million

1461
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,999
here 500 million here truly
nothing we

1462
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,999
were talking trillions a
thousand

1463
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,999
billion 

1464
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,999
so much money so a hundred
million to

1465
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:52,999
violence against women and other

1466
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,999
domestic abuse victims community

1467
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,999
oriented policing which I I
love it

1468
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,999
sounds like something I want a
part of

1469
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,999
300 million there are state
bailouts to

1470
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,999
compensate for revenue
shortfall five

1471
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,999
hundred and forty billion
sounds about

1472
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:11,999
right that's where that's what
New York

1473
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,999
California and an Illinois need
so

1474
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,999
that's in there twenty five
billion as I

1475
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,999
said to the United States
Postal Service

1476
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,999
couple of billion for some work
programs

1477
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,999
every single Department gets a
top-up

1478
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,999
you know at you need some money
thirty

1479
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,999
million extra for you to combat

1480
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,999
coronavirus and Cova nineteen
godly the

1481
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:40,999
Ryan White hiv/aids boy

1482
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,999
for covert nineteen I don't
know why

1483
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,999
exactly but they turn around
and give

1484
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,999
half a billion to the niaD or
NIAID

1485
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,999

gets five

1486
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,999
hundred million dollars dude
you know to

1487
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,999
combat coronavirus seven
billion for

1488
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,999
states child care services
ninety

1489
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,999
billion for schools

1490
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,999
then there's the Student Loan

1491
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,999
Forgiveness up to ten thousand
dollars

1492
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,999
and of course there's a twelve
another

1493
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,999
second stimulus check of twelve
hundred

1494
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,999
dollars and extension of
unemployment

1495
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,999
benefits infrastructure oh boy
they put

1496
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,999
it in there fifteen billion
dollars for

1497
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,999
highways which is like no
that's nothing

1498
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,999
but they did add another 15
billion

1499
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,999
reserved for overrun because
that's how

1500
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,999
the government works you know
it might

1501
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,999
be double that one hundred
billion

1502
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,999
dollars one hundred billion
dollars for

1503
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,999
rental assistance I don't know
what Judy

1504
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:34,999
read but it's right there in the

1505
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,999
document a hundred billion
dollars for

1506
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,999
what that would Amy Amy

1507
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,999
11 billion assistance for the
homeless

1508
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,999
well what was she reading
everything

1509
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:47,999
you're saying here is an envier
had

1510
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,999
nothing to do with her
interpretation I

1511
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,999
don't know I'm I'm just telling
you what

1512
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,999
I saw eleven billion for the
homeless

1513
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,999
assistance which interestingly

1514
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,999
interestingly was not worded as
people

1515
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,999
experiencing homelessness it
was just

1516
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,999
homeless assistance and then
they shored

1517
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,999
up the language around relief
funds so

1518
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,999
the stimulus of the SBA loans
who can

1519
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,999
have it who can't and I think
this is

1520
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,999
the big point that you know if
you

1521
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:17,999
listen to Tucker Carlson which
I did not

1522
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,999
clip give the money to illegals
so it's

1523
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,999
not a good enough you don't
need to clip

1524
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,999
no sounds just like it nowhere
in this

1525
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,999
document does it say that but
remember

1526
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,999
this is the heroes Act so the
heroes Act

1527
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,999
wants to honor the heroes and
the heroes

1528
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,999
try to give again that's called
the

1529
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,999
heroes act right and the heroes
include

1530
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,999
people who are what is the term
what

1531
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,999
kind of workers do we have
right now we

1532
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,999
have what we have essential and

1533
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,999
non-essential yeah so grocery
store

1534
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,999
checkout clerks and write
heroes and as

1535
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,999
we have discussed many times in
the past

1536
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,999
in the United States if you are
living

1537
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,999
here illegally you're
undocumented if

1538
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,999
you have a job construction
domestic

1539
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,999
work restaurant kitchen you can
obtain

1540
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,999
from the IRS at ein a tax payer

1541
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,999
information number and you can
pay taxes

1542
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,999
every single month or every two
weeks

1543
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,999
and you it's completely legit
so you're

1544
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,999
not committing tax fraud even
though you

1545
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,999
here illegally and don't have
all your

1546
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,999
other papers in order and of
course

1547
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,999
there's no payroll to a bunch
of things

1548
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,999
that don't work but this has
been

1549
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,999
accepted behavior for decades
as long as

1550
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,999
you pay your taxes in America
it's okay

1551
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,999
so what they specified in this
bill is

1552
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,999
how anybody should be eligible
for

1553
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,999
relief funds retro actively as
long as

1554
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,999
they have a taxpayer
identification

1555
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,999
number so you don't have to be
here

1556
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,999
legally and in addition to that

1557
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,999
essential workers cannot be
deported

1558
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,999
they need to be protected these
heroes

1559
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,999
because they work in kitchens
they work

1560
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,999
and clean up etc and that's
quite a lot

1561
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,999
of people a lot of heroes who
are here

1562
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,999
illegally and work in those
jobs and are

1563
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,999
thus considered essential while
illegal

1564
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,999
and that is it's an amnesty
because once

1565
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:37,999
you know if it's like hey during

1566
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,999
coronavirus you can't deport
people who

1567
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,999
work in kitchens or work in
cleaning

1568
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,999
services or etc it's quite
broad the

1569
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,999
podcasters are also essential
personnel

1570
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,999
literally stated podcasting so
that

1571
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,999
casting is actually mentioned
in the

1572
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,999
bill yes yeah no no no no no
not this

1573
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,999
one in the one in the original
from the

1574
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,999
federal government under media
services

1575
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,999
under media services the
original bill

1576
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,999
or the original recommendation
because

1577
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,999
now there's no bill that's sure
that

1578
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,999
yeah I am because I put it in
the show

1579
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,999
notes I remember these things
well I'd

1580
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,999
like to see it Oh God

1581
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,999
right after I have you saying
it's just

1582
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,999
that seems unusual okay I've
only said

1583
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,999
put in one document and that
was the Los

1584
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,999
Angeles County Health
Department's yeah

1585
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,999
I'll get it for you so anyway
that is of

1586
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,999
course a non-starter because
it's a

1587
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,999
sneaky way of providing some
form of

1588
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,999
amnesty and until coronavirus
is over

1589
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,999
which it never will be then
these people

1590
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,999
could not be deported or could
not be

1591
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,999
you know dealt with as illegals
but

1592
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,999
that's an interesting trick
it's a well

1593
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,999
the Tucker's right but then but
it's not

1594
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,999
entirely truth he says it so
then there

1595
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,999
are payroll tax cuts for
corporations

1596
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,999
who have employees working
during the

1597
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,999
pandemic and then all of a
sudden a

1598
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,999
whole telecom section no price
gouging

1599
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,999
rules there will be much money
for free

1600
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,999
Wi-Fi at and around schools and

1601
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,999
libraries emergency broadband
for those

1602
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,999
who cannot afford it and if you
can't

1603
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,999
afford any kind of phone or any
kind of

1604
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,999
device we've got the new Obama
phone and

1605
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,999
it's a they call it the enhanced

1606
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,999
lifeline 

1607
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,999
with 4G LTE yeah you got a 4G
LTE Trump

1608
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:34,999
exactly 

1609
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,999
Corona phone and all of a
sudden in

1610
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,999
there this is how it's so
obvious that

1611
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:41,999
this is just a bill stuck
together by

1612
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,999
other bills there's a heading
that says

1613
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:50,999
don't break the t band and I'm
like what

1614
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,999
what is this it's clearly a
slogan yes

1615
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,999
it is the repeal of the t band
auction

1616
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,999
for telephony that's very
important for

1617
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,999
coronavirus obviously and
whatever

1618
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,999
lobbyists from the
telecommunications

1619
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,999
industry who put that in there
with the

1620
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,999
existing headline don't break
the t band

1621
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,999
that that was really the for me
that's

1622
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,999
pretty sloppy to build I was
like okay

1623
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,999
this is horrible it's sloppy I
mean of

1624
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,999
course Trump already said it's
DOA and

1625
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:23,999
the Republicans aren't gonna
vote for a

1626
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,999
new I know so they gotta have
the reeds

1627
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,999
do it but what if this is this
bad right

1628
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,999
off the bat and they're gonna
massage a

1629
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,999
little bit could could it get
worse cuz

1630
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:35,999
eventually something's gonna
get passed

1631
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,999
well let's listen to Pelosi on
Tapper

1632
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,999
just you can get when get into
her head

1633
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,999
she's wearing her little
kerchief around

1634
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,999
her reptilian neck I can say
that

1635
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,999
because I don't like lavage
she's

1636
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,999
wearing a balk loes not a balk
Lavazza

1637
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,999
crew chief chief and the fact
is that in

1638
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:53,999
all four the bills that have
passed

1639
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,999
before they've all been
bipartisan and

1640
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,999
we've all in our caucus have
agreed that

1641
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,999
everything is coronavirus
centric and

1642
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,999
also in a timely way that
relates to the

1643
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,999
virus it's too deadly to our
lives to

1644
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,999
our livelihood to our democracy
for us

1645
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,999
to use it for any other purpose
so when

1646
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,999
the money for state and local
is to lay

1647
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,999
the cost of the defray the cost
of the

1648
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,999
outlets they've made for
coronavirus and

1649
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,999
the revenue lost because of the
corona

1650
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,999
virus testing testing with
three pillars

1651
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,999
I honor are here this is very

1652
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,999
interesting listen to how she
doesn't

1653
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,999
she doesn't really care about
anything

1654
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,999
but power and yes did you
notice that

1655
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,999
she was about to say yes that's
why I

1656
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,999
think testing that's why I
stopped it

1657
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,999
she's about to say a number of
thing

1658
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,999
here which he just listened to
what

1659
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,999
she's really saying and you
tell me if

1660
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,999
she's concerned about the virus
or about

1661
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,999
her position and party and a
and well

1662
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,999
man bad the coronavirus testing
testing

1663
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,999
the three pillars okay the
three pillars

1664
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,999
I thought it's gonna be testing
testing

1665
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,999
testing but the three pillars
oh no it's

1666
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,999
very different honor our heroes
by

1667
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,999
supporting our state and local
entities

1668
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,999
honor our heroes so that they
don't lose

1669
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,999
their jobs these heroes don't
lose their

1670
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,999
jobs open up how about opening
up the

1671
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,999
hospitals for other things
Nancy instead

1672
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,999
of Oh honor them what does it
mean how

1673
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,999
do I honor our heroes so they
don't lose

1674
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,999
their jobs what can I do with my

1675
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,999
honoring them how will that how
will

1676
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,999
that possibly help these heroes
don't

1677
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,999
lose their jobs open up
government by

1678
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,999
testing tracing treatment etc
testing

1679
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,999
wait a minute so the most
important

1680
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:40,999
question we have this is the
most

1681
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,999
powerful woman in American
politics how

1682
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,999
do we open up our states I want
to know

1683
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,999
opening up my state here in
Texas what

1684
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,999
do I need to do again Nancy
don't lose

1685
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,999
their job open up government by
testing

1686
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,999
tracing a treatment etc testing
tracing

1687
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,999
treatment etc

1688
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,999
yep that's worse than Trump's
plan it's

1689
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,999
not maybe it's just me and the
third is

1690
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:11,999
putting money in the pockets of
American

1691
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,999
people all of the time - and
Centrex to

1692
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,999
the coronavirus we would be an
endless

1693
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,999
amount of money if we put our
wish list

1694
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,999
for the future in there but
that is not

1695
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,999
what the case is and sometimes
I get a

1696
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,999
little heat for my own folks
who say why

1697
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,999
can we do this in this bill and
that in

1698
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:31,999
the bus because that's not what
the bill

1699
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,999
is about this bill is for this
purpose

1700
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,999
and it's a big price but it's a
big

1701
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,999
problem and as chairman of the
Fed said

1702
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:40,999
think big because the interest
rates

1703
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,999
will never be lower and so we
are

1704
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,999
they've used the interest rates
now here

1705
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,999
here it is this is where she
goes into

1706
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,999
full on partisan mode she said
well the

1707
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:57,999
secretary said interest rate
too low

1708
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,999
will never be lower and so we
are

1709
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,999
they've used the interest rates
to give

1710
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,999
confidence that credit will be
available

1711
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,999
because the interest rates are
low we

1712
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,999
want those same interest rates
and they

1713
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,999
use it to bolster the stock
market we

1714
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,999
want to use it to bolster the
American

1715
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,999
people oh so true Nancy this
woman is

1716
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,999
horrible and it leads me to
another

1717
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,999
horrible individual and only
because you

1718
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,999
were talking about the Irish
helicopter

1719
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,999
money with yes yeah sorry did
you find

1720
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,999
this story - throwing money out
knife

1721
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,999
I found another helicopter from
the

1722
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,999
mooch Anthony are they doing
too much or

1723
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,999
too little well I think they
need more

1724
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,999
helicopter money to be handed I
mean I

1725
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,999
we did that analysis it's about
three

1726
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,999
thousand dollars a person and
fifteen

1727
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,999
hundred dollars for a child and
they're

1728
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,999
offering of twelve hundred and
five

1729
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,999
hundred respectfully so yes I
think they

1730
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,999
need to put up more helicopter
money

1731
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,999
they just injected or they're
gonna pass

1732
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,999
state orders fifty billion
dollar

1733
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,999
additional small business
stimulus and I

1734
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:02,999
predict that they will send more

1735
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,999
helicopter money out to the
average

1736
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,999
American this will be a Main
Street and

1737
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,999
Wall Street recovery program
helicopter

1738
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,999
money helicopter money
helicopter money

1739
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,999
I guess that should be

1740
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,999
a show title one day a mangies

1741
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,999
helicopter money was using the
term but

1742
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,999
maybe he has a helicopter and
wants to

1743
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,999
throw some cash out I don't
think I

1744
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,999
don't think I've ever that I've
heard

1745
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:29,999
the term but I it's like
helicopter

1746
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,999
parents the parents aren't
actually

1747
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:32,999
flying in a helicopter above
the kid

1748
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,999
well I did because I had a
helicopter

1749
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,999
but that's hovering around I
actually

1750
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:43,999
did that okay so we've done the
bailouts

1751
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,999
excuse me well beside before
you go on

1752
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,999
because Pelosi did say
something there

1753
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,999
mm-hmm on the interest rates
will never

1754
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,999
get lower let's play another
Trump clip

1755
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,999
from his when his little
meeting there

1756
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,999
and Trump on negative interest
rates

1757
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,999
that he wasn't interested in the

1758
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:02,999
bringing interest rates
negative and

1759
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,999
that you saw a need for
additional

1760
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,999
stimulus from Congress I know
that you

1761
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,999
said we could wait to see on
stimulus

1762
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,999
that you you want negative
rates lalala

1763
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,999
believer and negative rates
only if

1764
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,999
other countries that are
competitors

1765
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,999
with Germany feared allied
they're

1766
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,999
friends of ours but there's
still

1767
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,999
competitors on trade and other
things so

1768
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,999
Germany Japan others have
negative rates

1769
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,999
that I think if they do we're
the most

1770
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,999
prime of the world you know
where it's

1771
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,999
based many countries based on
the dollar

1772
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,999
the dollar is by far the
strongest most

1773
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,999
powerful currency in the world
we've

1774
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,999
made it more powerful we've
made it

1775
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,999
stronger and certainly if
they're gonna

1776
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,999
have the advantage of negative
rates we

1777
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:43,999
should too

1778
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:44,999
I feel strongly we should have
negative

1779
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,999
rates negative rates is
basically where

1780
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:48,999
they pay you interest if you
borrow

1781
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,999
money this is a new one I've
been

1782
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:52,999
looking for something like that
all my

1783
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,999
life that's a pretty good one
but

1784
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,999
certainly if other countries
are going

1785
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,999
to be paying for putting out
money I

1786
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,999
mean they think of it they're
borrowing

1787
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,999
money or instead of paying
interest they

1788
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:04,999
getting paid

1789
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,999
it's the craziest thing but you
know

1790
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,999
what other countries are doing
it look

1791
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,999
at Germany look at Japan look
at others

1792
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,999
and with the most Prime in the
world

1793
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,999
right now and we have this we
have the

1794
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,999
currency and we have we have
the power

1795
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,999
of the dollar Wow Wow just step
the hell

1796
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:27,999
back and take this one so Trump
is all

1797
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:28,999
in on the negative interest
rates well

1798
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,999
there you go anyone he wants it
Oh

1799
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,999
doesn't want it Paulo she's
full of shit

1800
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,999
when she says it won't go any
lower the

1801
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,999
right the end is near oh my god
so well

1802
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,999
of course from his perspective
we're not

1803
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,999
competitive with our rate so we
we have

1804
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,999
to go to negative interest
rates whoo

1805
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,999
that's gonna be fun and all of
this a

1806
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,999
mere day or two before the
Bitcoin

1807
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,999
happening oh my goodness what
is gonna

1808
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,999
happen in the world you know
bitcoins

1809
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,999
gonna go to $400,000 in the
next month

1810
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,999
or two so I'm just saying huh
yeah

1811
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:05,999
according to Max you know you
getting

1812
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,999
cash a coin and it quit the
show me

1813
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,999
meanwhile what and give up show
business

1814
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,999
yeah I know

1815
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,999
meanwhile the European Union is
in such

1816
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,999
disarray over over Germany
because

1817
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,999
Germany I think the European
Union is

1818
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:27,999
now kind of realizing that
Germany

1819
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,999
actually runs the show and
there's the

1820
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,999
new German Republic the new
German

1821
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,999
Empire they finally figured
this out we

1822
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,999
even though the Brits have been
telling

1823
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,999
him this forever it's yes and
they're

1824
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,999
very some Peretz some Brits
have noticed

1825
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,999
it but yeah we've noticed it
yeah very

1826
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,999
very dismayed over how things
are going

1827
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,999
financially in the European
Union hmm

1828
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,999
well what's the French figure
it out

1829
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,999
then war yeah yeah you're not
kidding

1830
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,999
just a little update you have
been

1831
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,999
working a lot on my on my
computer setup

1832
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,999
that would pretty much all
command line

1833
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,999
now so I also took the time to
there

1834
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:10,999
well 

1835
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,999
you know what in act of the
future I

1836
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,999
have decided that computers are
first of

1837
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,999
all they're just getting lower

1838
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,999
throughput into from you to the
machine

1839
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,999
and back I mean that's is why
we have

1840
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,999
pads and touch and please don't
actually

1841
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,999
do anything you can't get the
computer

1842
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:30,999
do anything unless you unless
you go to

1843
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,999
a system that lets you program
your apps

1844
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,999
and string them together
yourself it

1845
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,999
doesn't matter I wanted to get
rid of

1846
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,999
the contactless thermometer
spam because

1847
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,999
I what okay I keep receiving
emails

1848
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,999
which is spam for contactless

1849
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,999
thermometers you know the ones
which you

1850
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,999
cannot find if you want to go
buy one at

1851
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,999
the at the skew you know a CVS
or

1852
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,999
anywhere I mean all
thermometers are

1853
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,999
sold out so this spam is all
over the

1854
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,999
place and it keeps getting
through the

1855
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,999
spam filter I've never gotten
one of

1856
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,999
these things ever well I'll
never get

1857
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:14,999
one ever again because the word

1858
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,999
thermometer is the one and only
word

1859
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,999
band now but I figured out what
they're

1860
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,999
doing they reverse engineer
Bayesian

1861
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,999
logic in the body of the message

1862
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,999
so the subject line they
literally say

1863
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,999
contactless thermometer you
need it now

1864
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:32,999
or something like that and then
in the

1865
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,999
body of the message they've
they have

1866
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,999
these sentences strung together
which

1867
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,999
will always include my first
name and

1868
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,999
maybe a topic of interest to me
which I

1869
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,999
think they probably got from
you maybe

1870
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,999
is on a forum or from Twitter or

1871
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,999
something and they scrape stuff
and

1872
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,999
through that they literally go
against

1873
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,999
the Bayesian logic that would
determine

1874
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,999
that to be spam by putting these

1875
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,999
elements in and the spam
detector just

1876
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,999
can't stop it it's you know who
those

1877
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:04,999
guys should be advertising for
real

1878
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,999
products because they know what
they're

1879
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,999
doing it's very interesting
well I'm

1880
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,999
drove you to go command line no
I'm told

1881
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,999
I'm totally command line it's
actually

1882
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,999
I'm hjkl that's where I live

1883
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,999
okay I live in H you know what
hjkl is

1884
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,999
no I don't know what hjkl is
the HJ Kel

1885
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,999
and K and L keys on the
keyboard are the

1886
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,999
universal keys for navigation
on command

1887
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,999
line so H is left J is down k
is up L is

1888
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,999
right and this is an old word
star o

1889
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,999
what it's the VI works that way
but also

1890
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,999
if you go to the if you go to
Twitter

1891
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,999
just the web Twitter and you go
to just

1892
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,999
what doesn't matter what it is
hit the J

1893
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,999
key it'll go down hit the K key
it'll go

1894
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,999
up hit the L key it'll like
that that

1895
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,999
tweet hit the the T key it'll
do a

1896
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,999
retweet so this is this has been

1897
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,999
something that that's that
efficient

1898
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,999
data engineers have been doing
for a

1899
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,999
long time they do for a living
to have

1900
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:17,999
to sit the keyboard they got to
get

1901
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,999
things done and as it turns out
this is

1902
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:20,999
what I do for a living I sit at
the

1903
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,999
keyboard all day managing data
managing

1904
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,999
emails managing RSS feeds
managing

1905
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,999
stories managing clips

1906
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,999
exactly exactly why I did it
I'd like to

1907
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,999
talk about the brain what do
you think

1908
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:38,999
no no I think we should do a
quick thing

1909
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,999
on China and then we'll take a
break

1910
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,999
Dutch way to China afterwards I
like

1911
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:45,999
China well it sounds like
you've got

1912
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,999
some China well then we'll take
a break

1913
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,999
got really got no China that's
the

1914
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,999
reason oh so you just don't
want me to

1915
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,999
do China maybe I get no no you
know what

1916
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,999
never mind we will go into a
break all

1917
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,999
right you have a China clip
yeah we're

1918
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,999
gonna do that after the break
but before

1919
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,999
we do that I do need to play
this clip

1920
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,999
you've got to ask yourself what
level

1921
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,999
has John McAfee sunk to if he's
doing

1922
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,999
interviews on the Nick the rat
show

1923
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,999
clearly clearly unawares of

1924
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,999
the knick the rats show is hey
wait a

1925
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,999
minute hold on stop hey wait so
you get

1926
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:34,999
a phone - hi would you like to
do my

1927
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,999
show what's it cause - Nick the
rat show

1928
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,999
and he's oblivious to the name
of the

1929
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,999
show itself so much so that he
doesn't

1930
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,999
figure out what's going on I
mean even

1931
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,999
listen to an old show John is
gonna

1932
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,999
sewer junks in a sewer during a
show

1933
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,999
john mcafee it does an
interview with

1934
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,999
anybody any buddy regardless of
who you

1935
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,999
are where you are audience
sighs it

1936
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,999
doesn't matter which is one of
the

1937
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:04,999
reasons why I have no interest
in

1938
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,999
speaking with him because he's
already

1939
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,999
been everywhere but I think
that Nick

1940
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,999
the rat deserves a
Congressional Medal

1941
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,999
Medal of Honor for asking the
following

1942
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,999
question time for one more
question okay

1943
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,999
one more question last question
is uh

1944
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,999
the do you know John C Dvorak
used to

1945
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:24,999
write for PC Mac I'm sorry this
is not

1946
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,999
safe for work and I'm not in
the habit

1947
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,999
of bleeping it out but it's not
safe for

1948
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:35,999
work you have been warned is he
parent

1949
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,999
Lee you owe him a lunch
nonsense that

1950
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,999
mother fucker owes me way more
than a

1951
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,999
goddamn lunch every time he
brings you

1952
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,999
up he's like John McAfee he
owned he

1953
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,999
owes me a lunch and but I was
wondering

1954
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,999
fuck that shit he owes me a good

1955
01:25:52,000 --> 01:26:00,999
articles thank you so much
interview

1956
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:01,999
ends of course after that after
that

1957
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,999
fabulous question of course but
you know

1958
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,999
I've heard this because Nick
sent me a

1959
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,999
copy of course and I thought to
myself

1960
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,999
first of all is dinner yeah I
know I

1961
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,999
know this is this is that was
irksome

1962
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,999
yep and McAfee is full of crap
well what

1963
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,999
is this you owe him a good
article what

1964
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:21,999
it what kind of nuisance side
gigs you

1965
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,999
running Dvorak I'm not running
anything

1966
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,999
that he just throws that in he
doesn't

1967
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,999
need what okay I'll give you a
good

1968
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,999
article here I'll mail it to
you I think

1969
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,999
I think you should do an
article about

1970
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,999
how McAfee is overexposed on
low-level

1971
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,999
podcasts not including Nick the
rat by

1972
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:39,999
the way

1973
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,999
I have not written about john
mcafee

1974
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,999
since he was doing he says he
created

1975
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,999
the entire virus environment in
con

1976
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,999
computers it was pretty much
more

1977
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,999
abundant ill he popularized it
he made

1978
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,999
he popularized it for all
practical

1979
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,999
purpose of course he did it was

1980
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,999
abandoned he was a Superbrand
McAfee was

1981
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,999
I mean he first he created the
idea of

1982
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,999
virus and then he created
viruses to

1983
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:07,999
sell virus software didn't he
is that

1984
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:08,999
how it worked well we don't
know that he

1985
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,999
created but some suspicious he
retired

1986
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:13,999
rich because he sold off his
whole

1987
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,999
company that he spent all his
money yeah

1988
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,999
but literally on hookers and
blow which

1989
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,999
is kind of but he a boss he I
guess he

1990
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,999
when he says I do I
automatically cuz

1991
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,999
I'm thinking he feels that he's
done so

1992
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,999
many spectacular things not to
say that

1993
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,999
he hasn't because he's
definitely been a

1994
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,999
newsworthy guy and I should
have written

1995
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,999
something about it yes that's
true

1996
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,999
that's what I think he's
thinking but

1997
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,999
hey you know Mac if he gets
plenty of

1998
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,999
ink I just doesn't I don't know
what

1999
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,999
good it's doing I would like I
would

2000
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,999
just like anybody just someone
who's

2001
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,999
never done a podcast just to
contact

2002
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,999
McAfee and say I want you to do
a bug

2003
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:48,999
hit just make up a crazy name
and see if

2004
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,999
he shows up well you could
actually I

2005
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,999
bet you could do this and then
you could

2006
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,999
actually get an interview say I
am going

2007
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,999
to inaugurate a new podcast
call me

2008
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,999
whatever you want to call it
called the

2009
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:07,999
John McAfee John I really don't
care

2010
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,999
but I think what he would Joey
would do

2011
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,999
it I am very proud of our very
own Nick

2012
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:13,999
the rat you can hear Nick the
rat

2013
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,999
Wednesday evenings he broadcast
live

2014
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,999
from the sewer and of course
you can

2015
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,999
often hear his show on No
Agenda stream

2016
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,999
calm where we have all these
crazy

2017
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,999
people including ourselves and

we look at yes we did we looked
at its

2076
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,999
competitor as a competitor to
it that we

2077
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,999
looked at and this was the one
that had

2078
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:02,999
back 

2079
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,999

ugly mcdonald's and that was
done but

2081
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,999
where the that was done by
nicked a rat

2082
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,999
actually coincidentally that he
came in

2083
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,999
later I think we'd already
chose I'm

2084
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,999
looking now let's see what
maybe he may

2085
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,999
have but but the thing is Nick
and then

2086
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,999
Twitter said that that I know
he came in

2087
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,999
earlier actually then cesium
cesium came

2088
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,999
in late right I see it no yeah
and so he

2089
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,999
says well I Nick who had me
smeared on

2090
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:39,999
his show says on Twitter that I
was

2091
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,999
proud I not you as though I'm
picking

2092
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,999
the art is just not true
believe me we

2093
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,999
both picked the art and we
argue about

2094
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,999
it he says that I specifically
was

2095
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,999
afraid of the clown and then
it's

2096
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,999

how I view everything I used to
be a

2185
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,999
rabid Republican beholden to
the daily

2186
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,999
infotainment cycle and I until
a high

2187
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,999
school friend mentioned your

mother 

2190
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,999
yes a lot of Republicans were
dead

2191
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,999
listen to the show we have
Democrats and

2192
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,999
Republican Republican is a good
a good

2193
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,999
describing Republicans and they
tend to

2194
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,999
listen to Alex Jones it's Fox
and then

2195
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:50,999
that was that Hannity Hannity
Hannity we

2196
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,999
had one for a second last night
it's all

2197
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,999
they the New York toilet paper
times

2198
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,999
which I thought he

2199
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,999
he says it over and over I have
said

2200
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,999
this before he has got to be
the hardest

2201
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,999
working guy in show business it
shows

2202
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,999
its mediocre he took over where
James

2203
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,999
Brown left off the only thing
is I the

2204
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,999
whole show the Washington
toilet-paper

2205
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,999
times but I thought what's
funny is the

2206
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,999
either the Washington compost
that one I

2207
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:21,999
hadn't heard I thought that was
funny oh

2208
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:28,999
yeah he's I think mark I think
mark well

2209
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,999
anyway it's tiresome if you do
it if you

2210
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,999
do it over and over again it's
like what

2211
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,999
do you do i compost he's bad is
another

2212
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,999
one anyway he goes on he says
until a

2213
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:43,999
high school friend mentioned
your show

2214
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,999
since that time have been
happily taken

2215
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:46,999
my truth vaccine twice weekly
will

2216
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,999
forever be free from any future
amygdala

2217
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,999
swelling that's true I would
like to

2218
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,999
call out David Brantley who hit
me in

2219
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,999
the mouth as a douche bag Andrew

2220
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,999
Williams as a douche bag I do
not

2221
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,999
believe they have ever donated
no I

2222
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,999
would also like to be deduced
you've got

2223
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:14,999
it you've been deduced I want
to mention

2224
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,999
a little just a little
housekeeping here

2225
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,999
to the donors that like to
douche people

2226
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,999
and deduce themselves I believe

2227
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,999
cosmically it's quite likely
that ad

2228
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,999
douching after calling out
people for

2229
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,999
being a douche bag doesn't
deduce you

2230
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,999
but possibly D douches the
douche bags

2231
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,999
do we have any empirical
evidence for

2232
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,999
just anecdotal I just totally
anecdotal

2233
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,999
hmm and I get from sources I
got it from

2234
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,999
sources or syllogism Illya with
the

2235
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,999
matter and intelligence sources
agree so

2236
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,999
I the intelligence community the

2237
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:56,999
intelligence community they all
agree on

2238
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,999
this according to sources yes

essential for my mental health

please get a D douching I would
like to

2252

call it my smoking hot babe
Liana for

2253
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,999
being a douchebag

2254
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,999
as well as my friend Brandon
douchebag

2255
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,999
ok I have another piece of
housekeeping

2256
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:56,999
here ok I'm noticing a trend
for men and

2257
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,999
women both to use this exact
same term

2258
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,999
smoking hot right I am I'm just

2259
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,999
requesting personally that
somebody

2260
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,999
dream up another term
indicating a

2261
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,999
similar concept though because
I'm kind

2262
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,999
of tired of it I don't know
about you

2263
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,999
patience pay people supporting
the show

2264
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,999
you're doing it wrong I
recently had the

2265
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,999
abbot antibody test done

2266
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,999
Oh from admin Lazarus right
right right

2267
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,999
unfortunately I tested negative
I was

2268
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:31,999
really hoping to boost my No
Agenda

2269
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,999
antibodies match your fraud it
looks

2270
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,999
like I'll be a fraud for now
this brings

2271
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,999
me to the question by the way
there was

2272
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:40,999
a report it might have it on my
clipless

2273
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,999
that there's like 40% of these
things

2274
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:49,999
are faulty faulty faulty I have
one data

2275
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,999
point that's fun from our
official No

2281
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,999
billion for for swabbing
swabbing and

2282
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,999

a lot of

2283
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,999
blood tests counting in yeah
well

2284
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:16,999

2285
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,999

2286
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,999

gets the antibodies and tests
and tests

2290
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,999

01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,999
added to the daily confirmed
new corona

virus I hope would hope so I was

supposed to isn't it

2294
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:37,999
that would obviously be a major

2295
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,999
discrepancy but considering how

2296
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,999
problematic the date has been I
would

2297
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:42,999

Rogan people and there's been
about I

2483
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,999
think you probably picked up a
mouse a

2484
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:06,999
lot of listeners 5-nothing mm
Oh a lot a

2485

lot okay and they got into the
donating

2486
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,999
mode faster than listeners from
other

2487
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,999
sources I agree I agree that
you're

2488
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:16,999
right as they come in pretty
and they

2489
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,999
come in at the executive
associate

2490
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,999
executive producer level pretty
quickly

01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,999
there may be some $5 these
subscribers

2492
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,999

Brogan's

2493
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,999
Rogen's audience and that says
to me do

2494
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,999
the show again well first of all

2495
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,999
we're not calling them
audiences we call

2496
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,999
the media tribes now and
there's huge

2497
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,999
overlap between his tribe and
our tribe

2498
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,999
and and people who produced
this show

2499
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,999

good use

its business mesh is something

2615
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,999
happened there Guardian printed
this

2616
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,999
article I don't know why cuz
there Woody

2617
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,999
Allen's on the outs but this is
a

2618
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,999
guardian article and it says
Woody

2619
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,999
Allen's a rainy day in New York
tops

2620
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,999
global box office so they've
been

2621
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,999
rolling at this movie that was
paid for

2622
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,999
by Amazon Amazon Studios kicked
woody

2623
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:13,999
out after you know Dylan Farrow
made a

2624
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,999
fuss again even though this has
been

2625
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,999
done in court and one of
Woody's other

2626
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,999
kids says bullcrap but he's
been accused

2627
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,999
of being a molester and so they
do won't

2628
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:27,999
let his movie so they won't
even show

2629
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,999
he's been outed stuff not out
it what's

2630
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,999
the word cancelled so badly
that they

2631
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:33,999
won't even release this movie
in the

2632
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,999
United States and I saw this
movie it

2633
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,999
wasn't it on Amazon

2634
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,999
no no Amazon refused to put it
on I

2635
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,999
thought they had it on briefly
where did

2636
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,999
you see it I got it with a
screener

2637
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,999
interwebs yeah I got a screener
uh-huh

2638
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,999
and I watched this movie so
after it

2639
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,999
came out I think this is maybe
one of

2640
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,999
his best New York he's got a
series of

2641
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,999
new movies he's not about New
York I

2642
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,999
think this is one of his best
ones hmm I

2643
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:04,999
think his award-worthy I mean
it's a

2644
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,999
get some it's a plot neurotics
in new

2645
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,999
york again but it brings is a
little bit

2646
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,999
more about celebrity and the
shallowness

2647
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,999
of new york and it's just a it
but it's

2648
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,999
but it's an ode to new york i
think is

2649
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,999
one of his best new york movies
ever

2650
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,999
and unfortunately the american
public

2651
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:23,999
will never get to see it the
theater of

2652
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,999
course who cares nowadays note
all the

2653
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,999
theaters it was the renewed
interest in

2654
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,999
in in canceling him was it
there was a

2655
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,999
ronin pharaohs me to work or
what was

2656
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,999
the it was some of Ronan Farrow
and

2657
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,999
Dylan came out again and
started making

2658
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,999
a fuss they made a big fuss and
they did

2659
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,999
it using canceled culture
techniques

2660
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,999
they started hounding Amazon
because

2661
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,999
Amazon had picked his contract
right

2662
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:47,999
right right

2663
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,999
so they started how and and
dammuz on

2664
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,999
you know did he also supposed
to do some

2665
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,999
TV work for them and he did this

2666
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:58,999
horrible really a bad piece of
work and

2667
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,999
he gave it to them it's just
junk and I

2668
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,999
think Amazon so hypocritical
you know I

2669
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,999
mean I'm not a huge Woody Allen
fan of

2670
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:09,999
his movies I've seen you know
somewhat

2671
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,999
of course there's some seminal
ones that

2672
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:13,999
we can you know how could you
ever live

2673
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,999
without it just seeing some of
these

2674
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,999
great movies but you're really
into it

2675
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:25,999

kind of like I don't know what
they did

2700
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:35,999
they don't know quite what did
how to

2701
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,999
handle this clip because they
the

2702
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,999
Chinese influence news media
I'm sure

2703
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,999
they have mixed feelings but
they gotta

2704
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,999
run the story and like I say bi
Chinese

2705
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,999
hackers I like how you say
influence you

2706
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:47,999
you can just say control but the

2707
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:52,999
influence is just warm and
fuzzy yes CBS

2708
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,999
CBS is on a tear here we go
tonight the

2709
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,999
FBI and federal cybersecurity
agents are

2710
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,999
warning that hackers linked to
the

2711
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,999
Chinese government are trying
to steal

2712
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,999
research on coronavirus
vaccines and

2713
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,999
therapies the FBI says the
potential

2714
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,999
theft could jeopardize the
treatment of

2715
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,999
patients here in the u.s.
here's CBS

2716
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,999
chief justice and homeland
security

2717
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,999
correspondent Jeff Pegues well
the

2718
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,999
corona virus was sweeping
across parts

2719
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:23,999
of China in January my god Jeff
isn't

2720
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,999
stop one second I want to
mention

2721
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,999
something in this particular
thing

2722
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:29,999
especially when he's reporting
from home

2723
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,999
I am now wondering as we all
you like to

2724
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,999
make fun of Jeff in it

2725
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,999
come on is really a great
reporter but

2726
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,999
he's got this funny voice I
think he's

2727
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,999
got the same condition that JFK
giora

2728
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,999
when Robert Kennedy jr. has oh
oh when

2729
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,999
you hear reporting from home
that's when

2730
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,999
you're gonna hear it and I've
never

2731
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:52,999
looked into it but I'll bet you
he's got

2732
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,999
the same condition because he's
got

2733
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,999
these qualities well I don't
know why

2734
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,999
you have to take my joy away
that he's

2735
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:10,999
just has to poop dirty
correspondent

2736

Jeff McGee's

sweeping

2738
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,999
across parts of China in
January US

2739
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,999
officials say Chinese hackers
were

2740
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:20,999
already focused on the United
States

2741
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,999
trying to steal research from

2742
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:23,999
universities and pharmaceutical

2743
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,999
companies that were working on
a cure

2750
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,999
field the hacking charges
ratcheted up

2751
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,999
tensions over the virus between
the US

2752
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,999
and China or should have been
stopped at

2753
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,999
the source which was China but
it's not

2754
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,999
just China Iran is also on the
attack

2755
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,999
researchers at the
cybersecurity company

2756
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,999
recorded future say the Iranian
state

2757
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,999
targeted an executive at Gilead
Sciences

2758
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,999
the manufacturer of the
promising

2759
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,999
coronavirus treatment drug when
des

2760
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,999
aveer but Demers said China is
desperate

2761
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:07,999
to be first with a vaccine you
called

2762
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,999
this a holy grail of
information that

2763
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,999
these foreign actors are going
after

2764
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,999
there's nothing more important
right now

2765
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,999
than these treatments and
perhaps most

2766
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:18,999
significantly for China for a

2767
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,999
geopolitical value to be able
to say

2768
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,999
that they were the first to
develop a

2769
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,999
vaccine tonight in the
statement Chinese

2770
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,999
officials said the accusations
were

2771
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,999
without evidence but US
officials say

2772
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,999
anyone working on a vaccine
should be on

2773
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,999
hyper alert margarett well when
I heard

2774
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,999
him speak kind of in the
interview I

2775
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,999
heard it what the the condition
is

2776
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,999
called spasmodic dysphonia
that's what

2777
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,999
Robert Kennedy jr. has could be
could be

2778
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,999
that he has some of that or it
comes

2779
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:00,999
more like he just overworked
his voice I

2780
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,999
did you blow your voice shot
but good

2781
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:03,999
sound interesting

2782
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,999
well CBS is doing all kinds of
reports

2783
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,999
about China and this was 60
minutes

2784
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,999
this past Sunday it's just kind
of

2785
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,999
interesting how they their
version of

2786
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,999
the timeline of Corona and
China and Rob

2787
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,999
told us to direct questions
about the

2788
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,999
origin of the virus to the
Director of

2789
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,999
National Intelligence the
Chinese

2790
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,999
Communist Party has also
blocked the

2791
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,999
truth in the earliest days the
doctor in

2792
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,999
Wuhan who discovered the
outbreak was

2793
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,999
silenced by local officials he
later

2794
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:39,999
died 

2795
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,999
covet 19 in February the
Chinese did

2796
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,999
allow a visit by an
international team

2797
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,999
of experts including American
scientists

2798
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,999
we are coordinating with the
Chinese

2799
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:52,999
government and working closely
together

2800
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:56,999
on the corona virus outbreak in
China

2801
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,999
initially president Trump
praised China

2802
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,999
but in the following weeks
testing in

2803
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,999
the u.s. failed to catch up to
the need

2804
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,999
vital equipment was short
bodies filled

2805
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,999
refrigerated trailers and
science was

2806
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,999
continuously challenged don't
dump dump

2807
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,999
dump dump dump dump dump dump
dump dump

2808
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,999
dump and then I see the
disinfectant in

2809
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:23,999
a minute and is there way we
can do

2810
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:28,999
something like that injection
as the

2811
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,999
u.s. led the one and illness
and death

2812
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,999
the White House moved the focus
to the

2813
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,999
Chinese government that's where
this

2814
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,999
began last Sunday Secretary of
State

2815
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,999
Mike Pompeo attempted to
resurrect a

2816
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,999
debunked theory that the virus
was

2817
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,999
man-made in China a debunked
theory this

2818
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,999
has got to stop reporters
journalists

2819
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,999
just saying something is a
debunked

2820
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,999
theory is not journalism

2821
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:01,999
let's eat at least the mighty
CBS 60

2822
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:01,999
minutes 

2823
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,999
Pompeyo was trying to revisit he

2824
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,999
debunked the conspiracy
theories never

2825
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,999
been debunked of course it
hasn't been

2826
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,999
debunked but talking about why
is he

2827
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,999
saying it's debunked CB vs.
evidence

2828
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:15,999
that is debunk just because
somebody

2829
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,999
else said it wasn't the case
because

2830
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,999
it's uni and we still you know
here's

2831
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,999
what's not resolved people keep
saying

2832
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,999
this they say there's no bats
being sold

2833
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,999
at that at that wet market and
other

2834
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:28,999
people say well then it came
from bats

2835
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,999
being sold at the wet market
and other

2836
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:32,999
people say they don't sell bats
at that

2837
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,999
wet market is a seafood place
as our

2838
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,999
President himself says covering
up the

2839
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:42,999
spread of the corona virus
everybody

2840
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:47,999
knows what's going on there did
you see

2841
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,999
the altercation with the Asian
American

2842
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,999
reporter 

2843
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,999
it's perpetual which one is
this this is

2844
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:56,999
a new one this was this was a
new

2845
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:00,999
reporter and she's one of the
activists

2846
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:01,999
the activist reporters that are
now

2847
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:05,999
showing up to these conferences
men and

2848
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,999
women are good-looking they're
young the

2849
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,999
good-looking the guys are you
know

2850
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,999
they're kind of hunky the girls
are

2851
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:16,999
really cute and this and and of
course

2852
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,999
if they have anyone who's
either of

2853
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:25,999
collar journalists of color but
if you

2854
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,999
can get an asian-american to
ask a

2855
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:31,999
question about China that's
even better

2856
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,999
but this I think she jumped the
shark on

2857
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,999
this one you'll hear why
problem okay

2858
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,999
yeah go ahead please

2859
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,999
said many times that the u.s.
is doing

2860
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,999
far better than any other
country when

2861
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,999
it comes to testing yes why
does that

2862
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,999
matter why is this a global
competition

2863
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,999
to you if everyday Americans
are still

2864
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,999
losing their lives and we're
still

2865
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,999
seeing more cases every day so
it's like

2866
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:02,999
a typical unimportant
unimpressive

2867
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,999
question that is only meant to
attack

2868
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,999
the president's demeanor or how
he talks

2869
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,999
about something and and this is
she's

2870
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:12,999
wasting our time with this but
then this

2871
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,999
happens well they're losing
their lives

2872
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:15,999
everywhere in the world

2873
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:17,999
then maybe that's a question
you should

2874
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,999
ask China

2875
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,999
don't ask me has China that
question

2876
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,999
okay when you ask them that
question you

2877
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,999
may get a very unusual answer
yes behind

2878
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,999
you and here's what's really
interesting

2879
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,999
she came back after he said
well why

2880
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,999
don't you go ask China about
that which

2881
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,999
he's very consistently say
China knows

2882
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,999
everybody knows is China but
remember

2883
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,999
she's Asian Americans so she
gets to ask

2884
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:41,999
this follow-up question what
sir why are

2885
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:42,999
you saying that to me

2886
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,999
specifically I'm telling you
I'm not

2887
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:46,999
saying it specifically to
anybody I'm

2888
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,999
saying it to anybody they would
ask a

2889
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,999
nasty question like please go
ahead do

2890
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:52,999
you really think she expected
the

2891
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,999
President to say well clearly
you got

2892
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,999
splitty eyes you're a gook what
do you

2893
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:57,999
want I mean what the hell are
these

2894
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,999
people doing is that really
what she

2895
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,999
thought is that really why she
why do

2896
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,999
you say that to me is because I
look

2897
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:06,999
Chinese 

2898
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,999
this is infantile why you
notice the

2899
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,999
White House can ban these
people I don't

2900
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,999
know why they let him in well
then

2901
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:17,999
you're banning a woman of color
well

2902
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,999
it's it did what I would have
said the

2903

heads up the

2904
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,999
correspondents that get to go
to that

2905
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:25,999

02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:04,999
something and he's like I not
you

2923
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,999
anymore and oh but then we just
like

2924
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,999
that's not fair yeah you called
on me

2925
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,999
it's my time it's my turn of
course that

2926
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,999
question I want to question a
bunch of

2927
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,999
kids I'm probably what's her
name the

2928
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,999
Kaylee she also walks out I
mean at some

2929
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:24,999
point are you just dare to be
harrangue

2930
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:26,999
by the media they're unit
there's not

2931
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,999
these are not legitimate
questions well

2932
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:29,999
they're legitimate questions if
your

2933
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,999
National Enquirer or you know
or not

2934
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,999
even there no it's this these
are these

2935
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,999
are just questions to harass the

2936
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,999
president and he's not he
doesn't have

2937
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:40,999
to even show up

2938
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,999
ball bomb I think went over a
year

2939
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:44,999
without doing a press
conference at one

2940
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:48,999
point I mean Trump is doing a
favor I

2941
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:49,999
mean if they're gonna ask actual

2942
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,999
questions but I didn't hear any

2943
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,999
questions that were just like
no I use

2944
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:56,999
showing a chart you know it's
not what

2945
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:57,999
kind of a question is that what
I'm

2946
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:58,999
showing the truck because I
think it's

2947
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:00,999
interesting and you know and I
wanted to

2948
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,999
show it I'd beid what can you
can answer

2949
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:06,999
it yourself why you showing a
chart well

2950
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:11,999
we are in in a modern kinetic
war which

2951
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,999
means there's no bullets but
the the

2952
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,999
kinetics come from money and
regulation

2953
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:21,999
and maybe viral warfare but the
Trump

2954
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,999
administration is now talking
to as many

2955
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,999
chip makers as possible about
building

2956
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,999
fabs in the US which some are
of course

2957
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,999
going to do Apple is moving a

2958
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:33,999
significant amount of their
iPhone

2959
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:40,999
production from China to India
it was

2960
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,999
kind of interesting to see Van
Jones he

2961
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,999
had to some backpedaling to do
he was

2962
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,999
supposed to speak at some
conference and

2963
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,999
he tweeted I guess he found out
by

2964
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,999
himself that oh my god I'm glad
this got

2965
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,999
canceled because I I couldn't
have ever

2966
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,999
even done it and I found out it
was they

2967
02:11:59,000 --> 02:11:58,999
were 

2968
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:02,999
sponsored by wal way and that my

2969
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,999
takeaway is that's exactly
what's going

2970
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,999
on there's so much because Van
Jones

2971
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,999
wasn't just gonna go speak just
to be a

2972
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,999
nice guy he's getting paid all
these

2973
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,999
people II don't speak for free
generally

2974
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:16,999
I mean some people do but their
speeches

2975
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,999
are worthless yeah but but I
guess the

2976
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,999
understood even yeah professor
in

2977
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,999
Arkansas University his money
because he

2978
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:26,999
thought wait a minute

2979
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,999
okay somebody book okay the way
it's

2980
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,999
usually done somebody books you
to begin

2981
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,999
with right you don't just show
up to

2982
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:35,999
speak right so somebody calls
you up and

2983
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,999
say I'm gonna do it that we're
doing a

2984
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:38,999
conference blah blah blah blah
blah

2985
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:40,999
we're gonna pay you so much
money in his

2986
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:41,999
case he probably makes pretty
good money

2987
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:47,999
a 10 grand minimum and okay
I'll do that

2988
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,999
in this because and then you
tend to

2989
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:50,999
because you have to give a
speech to

2990
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,999
this audience the next thing
you do and

2991
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,999
I would say all speakers do
this you

2992
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,999
check out the event so you go
to their

2993
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:01,999
web page and see who's gonna be
there

2994
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:02,999
and what was a who the audience
is cuz

2995
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,999
you got to adjust your speech
to the

2996
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,999
people if it's a woman's a
bunch all

2997
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,999
women you got to think about
this so you

2998
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:10,999
go to the thing and you go to
the web

2999
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,999
page and the web page really
tells you

3000
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,999
the sponsor at the start of
this show

3001
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:17,999
two hours ago you said I don't
know why

3002
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,999
people think I'm a misogynist
but really

3003
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,999
you got to be careful if it's a

3004
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:27,999
conference with all women oh
yeah so you

3005
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,999
go yeah cuz of the you do I'm
not an

3006
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,999
idiot so you go to the website
you check

3007
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:36,999
it out and you're on the
website the

3008
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:37,999
most important thing you see on
there's

3009
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,999
who's sponsoring the thing and
the wall

3010
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:42,999
way people would be front and
center

3011
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,999
well this is no surprise he's
full of

3012
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,999
shit this guy well you walked
right into

3013
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:52,999

02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,999
glad NABJ canceled I would not

3028
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,999

02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,999
about pandemics impact on
vulnerable

3030
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,999
people though and he as a
posted and

3031
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:56,999
says so he cancels after they
canceled

3032
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,999
correct and oh now that he
decides to

3033
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:03,999
virtue signal yeah but if i am
not

3034
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:05,999
buying it but what he's doing
is he's

3035
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,999
busting the the National
Association of

3036
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,999
Black Journalists that they're
in bed

3037
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,999
with the Chinese he's busting
it because

3038
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,999
they cancelled his money-making
event

3039
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,999
okay now thank you

3040
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:21,999
it always comes down to the
money a

3041
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:23,999
professor at the University of
Arkansas

3042
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:28,999
arrested for undisclosed ties
to China

3043
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,999
Arkansas man Arkansas at least
went to

3044
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,999
Arkansas another one of these
thousand

3045
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,999
talents program did not
disclose the the

3046
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:39,999
money the deals that he had
there they

3047
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,999
charge and arrest these guys
now this is

3048
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,999
this is not some slap on the
wrist

3049
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:48,999
well good yeah I think so too
and I

3050
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:50,999
think we should talk about
Flint this is

3051
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,999
what Flynn oh yeah I got I got
Flint

3052
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,999
eclipsed well it's time to do
it now

3053
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:02,999
because we are in a very
interesting

3054
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:06,999
situation where really the news
wants to

3055
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,999
focus on death and destruction
and

3056
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:13,999
Corona and scary things we have
all

3057
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,999
kinds of documentation coming
out that

3058
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,999
seems and appears to backup
pretty much

3059
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,999
everything that has been said
about the

3060
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:24,999
Muller investigation the Russia

3061
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:29,999
collusion investigation about
the spying

3062
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,999
on the president the president
is now

3063
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:37,999
also tweeting Trump gate that
what it is

3064
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:41,999

3068
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,999
distinctive voices very good
you can you

3069
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:03,999
can it's me she just from a
professional

3070
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,999
point of view from listening to
your

3071
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,999
doing voices yeah I mean I
don't device

3072
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:09,999
about just listening to voice
she's

3073
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:13,999
borderline professional voice
over she

3074
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,999
has a couple of anomalies that
once

3075
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,999
they're corrected they're very
minor she

3076
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,999
has got the voice of that's
worth a lot

3077
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:22,999
of money whoa that's quite the

3078
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:24,999
endorsement I mean the way I
hear it she

3079
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,999
would fit perfect in our in our
mornings

3080
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:35,999
ooh 

3081
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,999
don't you think she would fit
perfectly

3082
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,999
she would she would do a zoo

3083
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:41,999
what did she what is she what
does she

3084
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:43,999
need to be corrected do you
want to

3085
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:47,999
correct her Live Well their
sake there's

3086
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,999
an inconsistent there's an
inconsistency

3087
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:55,999
in hers in her sweet sexiness
and this

3088
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,999
is and I can only express it
this way

3089
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:02,999
it's it's not mean it's like
when you

3090
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:03,999
try to do you're one of your
voices and

3091
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,999
it feels like an imitation of
somebody

3092
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,999
you can't maintain it you can
do a bit

3093
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,999
yeah a little bit you know yeah
you can

3094
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:10,999
do a little short thing it
sounds like

3095
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,999
Christopher Walken or someone
but you

3096
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,999
can't really do a maintain and
she she

3097
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:18,999
is at that point where she can
do it but

3098
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:20,999
there's a maintenance issue and
so she

3099
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:24,999
did apparently there's a meal
to hang in

3100
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:26,999
there longer with this sexiness
all

3101
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:30,999
right I'm a maintenance issue
okay

3102
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,999
maintenance it mate is my
maintenance I

3103
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,999
mean maintaining the all
maintaining the

3104
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:41,999
level of voice I got you yeah
okay

3105
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:45,999
that's very interesting what I
would

3106
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,999
suggest everybody reads and I
put it in

3107
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,999
the show notes in a show notes
calm and

3108
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,999
yes I'd like to reiterate
search dot na

3109
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,999
show notes calm and being it
dot IO are

3110
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,999
no longer work the developer
who made

3111
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,999
the search engine is as
abandoned it the

3112
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,999
beginning of the year everyone
multiple

3113
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:07,999
people have tried to reach out
to him

3114
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,999
the the site doesn't even work
now you

3115
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,999
could still go to na show notes
calm

3116
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:14,999
draw back all the show notes
yeah

3117
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:16,999
there's a drawback all the show
notes

3118
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:20,999
are there everything is in
structured

3119
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,999
XML data so if anyone wants to
build a

3120
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:24,999
new search engine please feel
free would

3121
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,999
be happy to resurrect search
any show

3122
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:31,999
knows calm anyway so we're back
to back

3123
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,999
to the yeah well really I don't
fit

3124
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,999
exists I have three clips okay
I just

3125
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:38,999
want to give a little
background her and

3126
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,999
then want your clips we really
need a

3127
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,999
daily Flynn podcast because
this is

3128
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,999
truly about the deep state

3129
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,999
and it's it's going to if we
didn't

3130
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,999
already have a wedge in in this
country

3131
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,999
is going to get a lot more
interesting

3132
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,999
and I was like why I just want
to say

3133
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:00,999
that Sidney Powell who is
Flynn's Mike

3134
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:02,999
General Michael Flynn and how
this all

3135
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:04,999
fits together hopefully your
clips will

3136
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:06,999
start to explain it

3137
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,999
Sidney Powell is his new lawyer
and

3138
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:11,999
she's the one that has pretty
much

3139
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,999
successfully brought all this
to light

3140
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,999
she has a complete timeline of

3141
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,999
everything that's taken place
and I will

3142
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:22,999
sum it up as follows

3143
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:27,999
the Obama administration and the

3144
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:29,999
Democrat Party with Hillary
Clinton were

3145
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,999
keeping tabs on Trump that's
why they

3146
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:36,999
had this research that was done
and paid

3147
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,999
for by Clinton and a law firm
and this

3148
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:40,999
was all known that this was
they even

3149
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,999
worked with Russians to get it
because

3150
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:43,999
they just needed something
really think

3151
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,999
it was going to win and and
just to make

3152
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,999
sure everyone got in the game
we figured

3153
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:53,999
out how to use some phony
baloney

3154
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,999
information from multiple
people to go

3155
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,999
through the FISA the Foreign
Service for

3156
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,999
surveillance act court to be
able to

3157
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:05,999
wiretap and listen in while not
actually

3158
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,999
get previously recorded
conversations

3159
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,999
from multiple people one of
them being

3160
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:13,999
general Flynn and just so
everyone

3161
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,999
understands why this is a big
deal we

3162
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:17,999
have a constitution in America
you can't

3163
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:21,999
do that we have a Fourth
Amendment Fifth

3164
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:22,999
Amendment there's a number of
other

3165
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,999
amendments this would violate
but after

3166
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,999
9/11 we all as a country said
you know

3167
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,999
if we had only know more about
these

3168
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:32,999
terms than we could have caught
them and

3169
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:34,999
all these people wouldn't have
died so

3170
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:35,999
the Patriot Act which was
written a long

3171
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,999
time before that but it showed
up and in

3172
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:40,999
that there was a new deal you
could

3173
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:44,999
listen in on American citizens
which is

3174
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,999
unconstitutional in at the
heart but we

3175
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:51,999
made a special law that you
could do

3176
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,999
that if you got a warrant from
a secret

3177
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,999
court secret but you could
trust it

3178
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:58,999
don't worry it's secret because
it will

3179
02:21:59,000 --> 02:21:59,999
be of the high

3180
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,999
a bar that it will be so
difficult to

3181
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,999
get a warrant to spy on an
American

3182
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:06,999
citizen it's I mean we might as
well not

3183
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:07,999
even have the court at all

3184
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:11,999
and of course you have to be
very

3185
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,999
truthful and confident in the
evidence

3186
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,999
you show to that court to
obtain this

3187
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,999
warrant none of that happened
in this

3188
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,999
case and spying was done here's
where it

3189
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,999
all went wrong in my opinion

3190
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:28,999
Trump won the Obama
administration and

3191
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:29,999
all the people who were
involved with

3192
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,999
this everyone who had
quote-unquote

3193
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,999
unmasked a flynn call with the
Russian

3194
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,999
ambassador they were in on it
including

3195
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:42,999
Joe Biden and that's documented
and they

3196
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:44,999
had a discussion on it on
January 5th

3197
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,999
just right before the
transition and

3198
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,999
Obama said oh man we got to do
it by the

3199
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:51,999
book but everyone sat in that
room and

3200
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,999
then they knew that if they
handed over

3201
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,999
all of the information they had
what

3202
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,999
you're supposed to do from one
President

3203
02:22:59,000 --> 02:22:59,999
to the next and the transition
one

3204
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,999
administration to the next if
they if

3205
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:04,999
they truly were honest and gave
it all

3206
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,999
then Trump would know
immediately he had

3207
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,999
been spied on and who had been
doing it

3208
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,999
so they suppressed that and
they doubled

3209
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:16,999
down trying to implicate Trump
in a

3210
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:20,999
Russian spying scheme with
Flynn kind of

3211
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:22,999
the point of the speak of the
spear

3212
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,999
which served two purposes one
we had to

3213
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:26,999
get Flynn out of there because
Flynn

3214
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:28,999
would be the one to investigate
and

3215
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,999
figure it out and and two we
needed a

3216
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:31,999
fall guy

3217
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:36,999
to really stick the knife into
Trump and

3218
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,999
that's now starting to unravel
because

3219
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,999
they didn't get Trump out in
time they

3220
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:42,999
weren't able to impeach him and
I

3221
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:44,999
presume the president's just
been

3222
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:45,999
sitting on this and now it's
time to

3223
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,999
release it and I think every
day we'll

3224
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,999
get a new piece and this latest
piece

3225
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:54,999
that we received is a list of
39 people

3226
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,999
39 or 29 things

3227
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:02,999
listen 20 lot around 30 people
who all

3228
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:09,999
requested unmasking unmasking of

3229
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:13,999
these of these phone calls and
if you

3230
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,999
want I have a two-minute clip
of NSA

3231
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,999
director Admiral Mike Rogers
explaining

3232
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:21,999
how that works as an older clip
because

3233
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:22,999
he's the guy once you play that
and then

3234
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:24,999
I'll play these three this
about bite

3235
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:26,999
and mostly yeah but it also
brings in

3236
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:30,999
Trump and Trump they do be the
last clip

3237
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:32,999
and Trump previews what's
coming or

3238
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,999
predicts right there we go on
so here is

3239
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,999
how the process works of someone

3240
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,999
obtaining the call that they're

3241
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,999
interested in the of an
American citizen

3242
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:46,999
would be redacted and now we
have to

3243
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,999
know who that person is so we
can

3244
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,999
understand what the call is
about so the

3245
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,999
respect to unmasking the
following

3246
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,999
criteria is apply first for the
National

3247
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,999
Security Agency we define in
writing who

3248
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:01,999
has the authority to unmask a
u.s.

3249
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,999
person identity that is 20
individuals

3250
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,999
in 12 different positions I am
one of

3251
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:08,999
the 20 in one of those 12
positions the

3252
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:13,999
director secondly we outline in
writing

3253
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:14,999
what are the criteria that will
be

3254
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,999
applied to a request to unmask
in a

3255
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:19,999
report and again part of our
process

3256
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,999
under 702 to protect the
identity of US

3257
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:24,999
persons as part of our
minimization

3258
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,999
procedures when we think we
need to

3259
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:29,999
reference a u.s. person in a
report we

3260
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:31,999
will not use a name we will not
use an

3261
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:33,999
identity we say u.s. person one
u.s.

3262
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,999
person to u.s. person three
that report

3263
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:38,999
is then promulgated some of the

3264
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,999
recipients of that report will
sometimes

3265
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:43,999
come back to us and say I'm
trying to

3266
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:44,999
understand what I am reading
could you

3267
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,999
help me understand who is
person one or

3268
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:49,999
who is person two etc we apply
two

3269
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,999
criteria in response to their
request

3270
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:53,999
number one you must make the
right

3271
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,999
question writing number two the
request

3272
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:58,999
must be made on the basis of
your

3273
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:00,999
official duties not the fact
that you

3274
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:01,999
just find this report really
interesting

3275
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:03,999
and you're just curious it has
to

3276
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,999
tangibly tied to your job and
then

3277
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,999
finally I said two but there's
a third

3278
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:12,999
criterion and that is the basis
of the

3279
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,999
request must be that you need
this

3280
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,999
identity to understand the
intelligence

3281
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:20,999
you're reading we apply those
three

3282
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:22,999
criterion we do it in writing

3283
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:24,999
and one of those 20 individuals
then

3284
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:28,999
agrees or disagrees and if we
unmask we

3285
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:30,999
go back to that entity who
requested it

3286
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:32,999
not every individual will
receive the

3287
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,999
report but that one entity who
asked for

3288
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,999
us we then provide them the US
identity

3289
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:40,999
and we also remind them the

3290
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:42,999
classification of this report
in the

3291
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:44,999
sensitive sensitivity of that
identity

3292
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,999
remains in place by revealing
this u.s.

3293
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:49,999
person to you we are doing it
to help

3294
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,999
you understand the intelligence
not not

3295
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:54,999
so that you can use that
knowledge

3296
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:56,999
indiscriminately it must remain

3297
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:02,999
appropriately protected and so
the 29

3298
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:07,999
people got to see this yeah and
even

3299
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:09,999
though you'd notice Roger says
there's

3300
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:14,999
20 people qualified to ask yeah
that was

3301
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:16,999
all I'm a little unclear
whether that

3302
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:18,999
means it's I thought it was 20
people

3303
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:23,999
can approve someone who can who
can look

3304
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:25,999
at it but that's it's a little
unclear

3305
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:29,999
to me what is interesting
though is the

3306
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:33,999
response from the New York
Times and the

3307
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,999
New York Times who they cannot
deny the

3308
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:38,999
the paperwork that is coming
out over

3309
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,999
this their headline is Trump
White House

3310
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,999
rewrites history this time
about Flynn

3311
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:48,999
and their article shows a
different

3312
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,999
picture by omission so they're
leaving a

3313
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:53,999
lot of things out and
background and

3314
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,999
it's quite sad they're in
trouble it's

3315
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:57,999
quite sad to see them I think
they're in

3316
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,999
trouble because not only cannot
just

3317
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:02,999
anybody go looking at these
names but to

3318
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,999
leak that name to the press
which

3319
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,999
happened repeatedly and I think
there's

3320
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:12,999
some documentary evidence of
that that's

3321
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,999
a that's a jailable offense
remembered

3322
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,999
um but it's gonna get get
introduced

3323
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:19,999
guys are well sadly I have I
have

3324
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:21,999
thought in a wringer yeah sadly
I have

3325
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:22,999
thoughts on who but let's
listen to your

3326
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:26,999
your joke clips and let's get
into the

3327
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:27,999
see how this will affect our
future

3328
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,999
there is a kind of a follow
kind of a

3329
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:34,999
cascade effect from Joe Biden
going on

3330
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,999
Good Morning America and so
this is

3331
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,999
we've just before the list
comes out Joe

3332
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,999
goes on this is kind of edited
down but

3333
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:45,999
this is biting on it says CMA
but GM a

3334
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,999
contradiction here we go I know
nothing

3335
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,999
about those moves to
investigate Michael

3336
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,999
Flynn number one number two no
I thought

3337
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:52,999
you asked me whether or not
always

3338
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:56,999
having to kill that clip I'm
sorry

3339
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:58,999
that's the clip I have to do
play that

3340
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,999
clip later play clips from GMA
1 sorry I

3341
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:03,999
know nothing about those moves
to

3342
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:05,999
investigate Michael Flynn
number one

3343
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,999
number two this is all about
diversion

3344
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:09,999
this is the game this guy plays
all the

3345
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,999
time the country is in crisis
were in an

3346
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:14,999
economic crisis a health crisis
but if

3347
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:15,999
they you were reported to be in
a

3348
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,999
January 5th 2017 meeting where
you and

3349
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,999
the president were briefed on
the FBI's

3350
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:23,999
planned a question Oh Michael
Michael

3351
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:25,999
Flynn over those conversations
he had

3352
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,999
with the Russian ambassador his
lyac now

3353
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:30,999
I thought you asked me whether
or not I

3354
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:32,999
had anything to do with him
being

3355
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,999
prosecuted okay I'm sorry I was
aware

3356
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:37,999
that there was that there that
asked for

3357
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:39,999
an investigation but that's all
I know

3358
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,999
about it I saw this and I have
an

3359
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,999
observation well wait okay what
give me

3360
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,999
your observation first but I
then I have

3361
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:49,999
an interesting point to make my

3362
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:51,999
observation is when this
question was

3363
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:55,999
being asked and the follow-up
Jo had an

3364
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:59,999
IFB and he was wiggling it in
his ear

3365
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:01,999
and he cocks his head to the
left and I

3366
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:09,999
guarantee you someone was
saying and you

3367
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:11,999
can see his face tilt again in

3368
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:13,999
recognition and then he comes
back with

3369
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:15,999
the oh no like I was talking
about this

3370
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:19,999
he was being souffle is that
the real

3371
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:24,999
I'm I now that you bring that
up I would

3372
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:25,999
say you're probably right
because he

3373
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:27,999
asked it was asked one question
he says

3374
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:28,999
I thought you talked about
prosecuting

3375
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,999
yeah which was the second part
when you

3376
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:33,999
take the first part from this
earlier

3377
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:34,999
part of the conversation and
then you

3378
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,999
put the second part which is
what I have

3379
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:38,999
here in this contradiction clip
when you

3380
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:40,999
take those two together this is
what you

3381
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,999
really got he never said
anything or

3382
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:44,999
even thought anything about your

3383
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,999
question being about
prosecution list

3384
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:49,999
to this clip I know nothing
about those

3385
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:51,999
moves to investigate Michael
Flynn

3386
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:53,999
number one number two now I
thought you

3387
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,999
asked me whether or not I had
anything

3388
02:30:56,000 --> 02:31:00,999
to do with him being prosecuted
there it

3389
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:05,999
is yeah yeah but he switched
midstream

3390
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:06,999
I'm telling you switched yeah
you're

3391
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:08,999
probably right because he's so
dumb that

3392
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:10,999
he never thought that that he's
already

3393
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:12,999
made the mistake no I thought
you said

3394
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,999
something else oh yeah you said
that you

3395
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:16,999
wanted orange juice I didn't
know you

3396
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:18,999
said milk at Tina Tina and I
were

3397
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:20,999
watching last night and I said
did you

3398
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:22,999
see that and I rolled it back
and she

3399
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:23,999
saw it too it says look he's
getting

3400
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,999
instructions he you know the
the the

3401
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,999
holding your left hand or what
did I FB

3402
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,999
is the is the intercom and
you're the

3403
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:33,999
depending on how it's set up

3404
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:35,999
it could have been Joe's people
talking

3405
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,999
to him it could be the the TV
network

3406
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:40,999
talking to him it could be you
know just

3407
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:47,999
same thing exactly and you've
seen it

3408
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:49,999
before where the newsreader
goes hold on

3409
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:50,999
hold on I'm getting important

3410
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,999
information one moment so he
makes one

3411
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:54,999
of those moves with his hand
he's

3412
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:56,999
cocking his head and he's
getting

3413
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:58,999
information he's being told
what to say

3414
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:00,999
this is gonna be great I hope
there's a

3415
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:02,999
debate with Trump but sadly I
think

3416
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:04,999
something else is gonna happen

3417
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:08,999
well I ain't ready for it but
someone

3418
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:10,999
has to go down for this spying
and

3419
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:14,999
Biden's name turns up on the
list as and

3420
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:16,999
Weah wydad in he's lying here
clearly

3421
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:18,999
because he knew all about it he
heard

3422
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:20,999
the call well but hold on

3423
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:24,999
why is Biden being highlighted
besides

3424
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:26,999
it being Joe I think it's time
to

3425
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:28,999
finally take him down so
Hillary can

3426
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:32,999
come in well I'm not gonna of
course I

3427
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:34,999
still have never pulled my
Hillary

3428
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:36,999
prediction so I'm gonna stick
with it

3429
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:38,999
but let's go on with this
theory of

3430
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:40,999
yours in mind and this is Ron
Paul says

3431
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:41,999
Ron people but it's not rand
paul and

3432
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:43,999
he's talking about the biting
unmasking

3433
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,999
questions that have Rennell
addressed

3434
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:50,999
the acting intelligence
official senator

3435
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:52,999
where does that stand is Rick
Rennell

3436
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:54,999
going to testify to your
committee if

3437
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,999
you've got confirmation of that
no but I

3438
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,999
did send a letter last evening
to

3439
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:01,999
Director of National
Intelligence Rick

3440
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:03,999
Cornell and asked him if he
would

3441
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,999
declassify this and we got this

3442
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:07,999
information today and released
it and I

3443
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,999
think this is astonishing that
Vice

3444
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:12,999
President Biden and really all
of

3445
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,999
President Obama's inner circle

3446
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:17,999
individually were requesting the

3447
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:19,999
unmasking of a political
opponent and

3448
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:21,999
you know you remember there was
a whole

3449
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:23,999
to do about trying to impeach
the

3450
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:24,999
president saying that we're
using the

3451
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:26,999
power of government to go after
a

3452
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,999
political opponent this is this
is a

3453
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,999
smoking gun if there ever was
one that

3454
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:34,999
Vice President Biden was using
the power

3455
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:36,999
of government abusing that
power to go

3456
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,999
after a political opponent
essentially

3457
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:41,999
unmasking someone is the
equivalent of

3458
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:43,999
illegally wiretapping them the

3459
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:45,999
government had permission to
listen to

3460
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:47,999
the Russian ambassador but to
protect

3461
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,999
Americans we mask their
identity but you

3462
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:52,999
got the whole President Obama's
inner

3463
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:54,999
circle clambering around
listening to

3464
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:56,999
the private conversation I
think he

3465
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:58,999
illegally and I think with ill
bill

3466
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:03,999
ill-begotten motives do you
know senator

3467
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,999
whether these unmasking
requests then in

3468
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:08,999
each and all of these cases
occurred

3469
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:10,999
after the election I mean
obviously the

3470
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:11,999
assessment was prior to the
election

3471
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,999
that Hillary Clinton was going
to win

3472
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:16,999
obviously that didn't happen so
did a

3473
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,999
lot of this that transpire
after the

3474
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:21,999
election itself yes the
document that we

3475
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,999
got listed all the names and
listed the

3476
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:26,999
date that they did the
unmasking so vice

3477
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,999
president unmasked general
Flynn to

3478
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:31,999
listen to his conversation
which i think

3479
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:33,999
is reprehensible but so did
James Comey

3480
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,999
so did James clapper so did
John Brennan

3481
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,999
so did Samantha Power's and so
did

3482
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:41,999
President Obama's chief of
staff and a

3483
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:43,999
dozen other people so think
about this

3484
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,999
it's illegal to listen to
people's

3485
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:48,999
private conversations you could
listen

3486
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:50,999
to if you have a national
security

3487
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,999
matter a foreigner but it's
thus the

3488
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:55,999
foreigners saying we're going
to blow up

3489
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:57,999
the Capitol and will you help
me you

3490
02:34:58,000 --> 02:34:58,999
don't get to listen to the other

3491
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:00,999
person's conversation if
they're just

3492
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,999
talking 

3493
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,999
yeah Rand Paul Graham answers
the

3494
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:08,999
question but the guess that
conversation

3495
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:10,999
took place after the election
there's no

3496
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,999
other reason to do it but now
we have

3497
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,999
the president chiming in on
this and he

3498
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,999
talks about it at that meeting
of the

3499
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:21,999
two governors and here he is on
a met an

3500
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:23,999
unmasking and he puts a little

3501
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:25,999
predictive thing at the end
here which

3502
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:32,999
makes you wonder what's coming
next is a

3503
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:36,999
massive massive thing it's I
just got a

3504
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,999
listing it's who can believe a
thing

3505
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:40,999
like this

3506
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,999
and I watched Biden yesterday
on Good

3507
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:45,999
Morning America being
interviewed by one

3508
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,999
of your colleagues Stewart

3509
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:49,999
Stephanopoulos and he said you
know

3510
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:51,999
nothing about anything he has
no ideas

3511
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,999
he knows nothing about anything
it's

3512
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:56,999
nothing at all and then it gets
released

3513
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,999
today that he was a big young
masker so

3514
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:01,999
how do you know nothing of
you're one of

3515
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,999
the unmasked errs it's one of
the very

3516
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,999
big stories and I suspect
you'll have if

3517
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:09,999
it's possible even bigger
stories coming

3518
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:14,999
out yeah it's he's been holding
on to

3519
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:15,999
this he's been wait I think
he's gonna

3520
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:19,999
hold on Obama and until after
the

3521
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:21,999
election does he want Obama
down I know

3522
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:25,999
he does because this is Trump
when that

3523
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:29,999
that White House one press

3524
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:30,999
Correspondents Dinner

3525
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:35,999
that's when Obama dressed him
down

3526
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,999
that's that's a publicly
ridiculed him

3527
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:40,999
that's called dressing him down
is it

3528
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:42,999
not oh I thought he was that
that that

3529
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:44,999
somebody with transsexual sorry
you are

3530
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,999
on a roll today hate for women
confused

3531
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:51,999
about transsexuals for women I
don't

3532
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:53,999
know what to do with you man
I'm telling

3533
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:55,999
you I love the smokin hot
ladies all

3534
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:57,999
kinds of issues with you today

3535
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:01,999
so where we're at now is Bill
Barr the

3536
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:05,999
Department the Attorney General
said hey

3537
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,999
to the judge I think is that in

3538
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:09,999
Washington DC we're dropping
all charges

3539
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,999
against Flynn clearly he was
railroaded

3540
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:13,999
we 

3541
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:14,999
have evidence we have
handwritten

3542
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,999
evidence of what the of what
the FBI

3543
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:19,999
agents were doing you know you
know some

3544
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:21,999
of the names like struck I mean
come on

3545
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:26,999
it's very clear and the judge
said no

3546
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:28,999
man I don't know about that I
think we

3547
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:30,999
should bring in another we need
to have

3548
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,999
some voices chime in here so
one he's

3549
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:35,999
got a retired judge who's gonna
come in

3550
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:39,999
and tell everybody Flynn should
be drawn

3551
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:46,999
and quartered yeah and at the
same time

3552
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:48,999
but I kind of like this doesn't
happen

3553
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:50,999
often but I lost my train of
thought the

3554
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:54,999
whole point was no I remember
the two

3555
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:56,999
thousand names they got the two
thousand

3556
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,999
name list for the lawyers who
were

02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:01,999
always writing everything

3558
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:05,999
lawyers yeah attorneys say
Trump sucks

3559
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,999
yes that's exactly what they
did again

3560
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:09,999

email

3565
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:19,999
couple these guys to see if
they were

3566
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,999
religious or alive and they
weren't and

3567
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:23,999
they're all part of a Trump
hating crowd

3568
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:27,999
hold on let's do this let's
look at how

3569
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:32,999

search for it mm prosecutors is
the

3581
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:03,999
search I'm doing and it's
popping up

3582
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:05,999
everywhere but it's I have to
go back

3583
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,999
further wait I can do tools

3584
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:09,999

3585
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:14,999
past year

3586
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,999
that's past you anyway it's
it's the

3587
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,999
same group and they are em
they're like

3588
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:22,999
oh hey I got an email from the
group

3589
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,999
what are we to sign it okay so
that's

3590
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:27,999
where we're at and that's gonna
be very

3591
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:31,999
interesting to see what happens
but

3592
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:33,999
someone's got to go down and it
would be

3593
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:35,999
great if it was Comey it would
be it

3594
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,999
would be great if they close
the FBI but

3595
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:39,999
Brennan I think Brennan could
be in

3596
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:40,999
trouble 

3597
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:42,999
but ma'am branch according to

3598
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:44,999
everybody's in trouble but he's
not in

3599
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:46,999
trouble and I'd like to know if
anybody

3600
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:47,999
can confirm that his security
clearance

3601
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:51,999
was pulled I never heard that
it was

3602
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:52,999
confirmed I don't know you're
talking

3603
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:57,999
new stories from three years ago

3604
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,999
okay all right did now did you
have more

3605
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,999
on the no that's all I got I
just got

3606
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:03,999
the bite and stuff and I think
you're

3607
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:05,999
probably right this may be the
one it

3608
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:07,999
may not be the one because you
still

3609
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:09,999
have the same old the John
Cooper's out

3610
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,999
there these guys who are you
know old

3611
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:14,999
PACs democrat party and they're
the ones

3612
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,999
who pushed Obama past Sanders
because

3613
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:18,999
they're not putting up with
didn't you

3614
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:20,999
know losing all that banking
background

3615
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,999
well that bankers money and the
bankers

3616
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:25,999
all said in the band the
Democrats are

3617
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:27,999
more of a holder to the bankers
and the

3618
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:28,999
Republicans are from what I can
tell

3619
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:35,999
seems and the oops hold on 1 2
3 4 5 5

3620
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,999
oh my god that is effor no
that's the

3621
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,999
coastal coming down from
Seattle but the

3622
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:42,999
coastal is always a little bit
I thought

3623
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,999
it was six last time now it's
five now

3624
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,999
it's five it just wouldn't
normally 12

3625
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,999
that thing isn't bad you know
what that

3626
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:51,999
means 

3627
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:55,999
what negative interest rates it
probably

3628
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:57,999
has something to do with these
three

3629
02:40:58,000 --> 02:40:58,999
states cuz this effort goes to
Chicago

3630
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:00,999
and this comes from Seattle it
goes down

3631
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:01,999
as Los Angeles's

3632
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,999
and these states are all
Democrats and

3633
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:06,999
all God you know don't get on a
train

3634
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:08,999
anyway where was I I was going
while I

3635
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:10,999
was gonna switch gears if we're
done

3636
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:11,999
with Flynn I want to do a quick
thing on

3637
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:13,999
Bill Gates and then thank some
more

3638
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:21,999
people okay on show number 780
of this

3639
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:23,999
No Agenda show best podcast the
universe

3640
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:27,999
from December 10th 2015

3641
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:29,999
this is what we discovered and
trumpets

3642
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:31,999
and yet Bill Gates knows what's
going on

3643
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:36,999
oh man apparently at the time
trump was

3644
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,999
all over Bill Gates and we have
to do

3645
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:40,999
something we have to go see
Bill Gates

3646
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:42,999
and a lot of different people
that

3647
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,999
really understand what's
happening

3648
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,999
apparently it was all in on
Bill Gates I

3649
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:53,999
don't think so so much anymore
and here

3650
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,999
is the the obligatory once a
show clip

3651
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:58,999
of Bill Gates telling us what's
going to

3652
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:00,999
happen what's needs to happen
and it's

3653
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,999
gonna be an RNAi vaccine and
sure people

3654
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:05,999
will die but it's the only way
to go

3655
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,999
there's an approach called the
RNA

3656
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,999
vaccine that people like
Madonna her

3657
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,999
back and others are using by
the way

3658
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:16,999
these are the companies that
either he

3659
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:17,999
personally but certainly the
Gates

3660
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:19,999
Foundation has put money into
moderna

3661
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:21,999
would be the number one it's
why he

3662
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:25,999
mentions it that in 2015 we
died enta

3663
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,999
fide that is very promising for

3664
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,999
pandemics and for other
applications as

3665
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:35,999
well and so if everything goes
perfectly

3666
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,999
with the RNAi approach we could
actually

3667
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:40,999
be at the 18 months we don't
want to

3668
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,999
create unrealistic expectations
the

3669
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,999
efficacy of vaccines and older
people is

3670
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,999
always a huge challenge you
know it

3671
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:51,999
turns out the flu vaccine isn't
that

3672
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:53,999
effective and old early people
most the

3673
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,999
benefit comes from younger
people not

3674
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,999
spreading it because they're
vaccinated

3675
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:01,999
this is an interesting little
tidbit and

3676
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:03,999
I I just kind of like
highlighting that

3677
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,999
since we know that the previous
flu shot

3678
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:12,999
the 2017-2018 increased the
likelihood

3679
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:14,999
of the person who received the
shot of

3680
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:19,999
developing a respiratory virus
by a very

3681
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:24,999
infect infection by 36% and so
if you've

3682
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,999
got old people in nursing homes
who I'm

3683
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:29,999
sure are pretty much told
you're getting

3684
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,999
this this vaccine even Bill
Gates knows

3685
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:37,999
they're not very effective on
older

3686
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:38,999
people because of the state of
their

3687
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:39,999
immune system

3688
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:41,999
and also in order to make it
effective

3689
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:45,999
they got to jack it up which is
is that

3690
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:46,999
think that's what you use the
adjuvant

3691
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:50,999
for the Hamburger Helper of
vaccines and

3692
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,999
that could make that viral
infection

3693
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,999
even worse possibly and that
that

3694
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:58,999
benefits on a community basis
the

3695
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,999
elderly here we clearly need a
vaccine

3696
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,999
that works in the upper age
range

3697
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,999
because their most at risk of
that and

3698
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,999
doing that so that you amp it
up so it

3699
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,999
works in older people and yet
you don't

3700
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,999
have side effects you know if
we have in

3701
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:17,999
a one in 10,000

3702
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:21,999
side effects that's you know
way more

3703
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:25,999
700,000 you know people who
will suffer

3704
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,999
from that so really
understanding the

3705
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,999
safety at gigantic scale across
all age

3706
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,999
ranges you know pregnant male
female

3707
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:38,999
undernourished existing
comorbidities

3708
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:40,999
it's very very hard and that
actual

3709
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,999
decision of okay let's go and
give this

3710
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,999
vaccine to the entire world
governments

3711
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:48,999
will have to be involved
because there

3712
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,999
will be some risk and
indemnification

3713
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:55,999
needed before that can be
decided on

3714
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:57,999
here's the question

3715
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,999
with all this moderna and all
this work

3716
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:04,999
on the r and a vaccine which is
in no

3717
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,999
means a vaccine in the
traditional sense

3718
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:12,999
because it's changing RN a
versus

3719
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:17,999
building immunity by
introducing a

3720
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,999
toned-down and or dead version
of the

3721
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:22,999
violated attenuated well here's
my

3722
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:24,999
question with all this focus
from Bill

3723
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:28,999
Gates clearly on this RNA
vaccine what

3724
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:30,999
if it doesn't work are we in
parallel

3725
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:34,999
doing the old growing it in an
egg thing

3726
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:35,999
I don't hear anyone talking
about it

3727
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,999
because now we I mean we are
not buddy

3728
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:40,999
coronavirus apparently does is
not isn't

3729
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:42,999
that's why they said I'm a new
pouchy

3730
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:44,999
said himself in one of these
little

3731
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:48,999
ditties there may never be a
vaccine for

3732
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:49,999
coronaviruses to one of those
it's like

3733
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,999
aids is one of those things
well like

3734
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:53,999
it's like

3735
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,999
like all these things like like
Ebola

3736
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,999
yes all these things why Bala
they do

3737
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:01,999
have something but it changes
just

3738
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:03,999
enough that it can't really be
a vaccine

3739
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:04,999
is ineffective and what they
mean

3740
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:06,999
generally speaking by changes
enough not

3741
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,999
so much with with AIDS but with
these

3742
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:11,999
corona viruses that they think
they do

3743
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:13,999
generate and the next thing you
know

3744
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:14,999
they're not effect they don't
really

3745
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:16,999
have the impact anymore Laura
Ingraham

3746
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,999
mentioned it the French guy who
talks

3747
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:21,999
about this together when you
know the

3748
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:23,999
Nobel Prize in medicine that
guy who

3749
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:25,999
thinks his nuts because these
goes

3750
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,999
against the grain who says this
bullcrap

3751
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:29,999
this thing isn't gonna last you
know

3752
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,999
more than a year because it's
going to

3753
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:36,999
just turn into dust can't
reproduce and

3754
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:38,999
live your are not on the right
program

3755
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,999
today man what do you think
that is and

3756
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:45,999
that is what Trump thinks too
yeah so

3757
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:46,999
this whole thing is that's
whether it's

3758
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:48,999
such a rush to get a vaccine
out so they

3759
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:49,999
can at least have something to
sell

3760
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,999
right well then we just get
back to the

3761
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,999
chlorine or oxy chloroquine
let's play

3762
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,999
one last clip from Laura this
is ingre

3763
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,999
Amano CQ now I told you about
seven

3764
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:03,999
weeks ago that
hydroxychloroquine was

3765
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,999
likely saving lives and now
another

3766
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:08,999
study confirms that conclusion
and it

3767
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:10,999
was conducted by NYU's Grossman
School

3768
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:12,999
of Medicine where researchers
looked at

3769
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,999
932 kovat patients who are on

3770
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:17,999
hydroxychloroquine along with
zinc in

3771
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:19,999
his it's room Ison they
concluded that

3772
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:21,999
the triple combo that they
awell with

3773
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,999
that they were 44 percent less
likely to

3774
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,999
die from the corona virus good
news

3775
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:31,999
take that FDA yeah I like the
I'd like

3776
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,999
the practical results more than
just

3777
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:36,999
these damn studies that are
rigged and

3778
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:38,999
you've got you know certain
AIDS groups

3779
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:40,999
whether it's positive or
negative I like

3780
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:42,999
hearing this from Texas what
happened to

3781
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:44,999
this nursing home was one of
the first

3782
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,999
big tests of its kind in Texas

3783
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:51,999
I thought the risk of seeing
15% of that

3784
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:53,999
nursing home die was just not an

3785
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,999
acceptable risk a third of
patients said

3786
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:58,999
this place in Galveston County
got the

3787
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:02,999
corona virus so dr. Robin
Armstrong used

3788
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,999
hydroxychloroquine pills to
treat 39 of

3789
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:06,999
them so the pace

3790
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:08,999
so done well you said most of
the

3791
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:09,999
patients have done well
somebody's

3792
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:11,999
listening to this might say way
he

3793
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:13,999
qualified it with most have
there been

3794
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:15,999
some who have not done well
with it well

3795
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:17,999
I would say I would say all the
patients

3796
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,999
have done well on Sunday these
patients

3797
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:22,999
finish their five days of
treatment and

3798
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:24,999
dr. Armstrong said no one
experienced

3799
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,999
any side-effects but the 65
year old

3800
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:29,999
anti-malarial drug has suddenly
become

3801
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,999
controversial President Trump
said it

3802
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:34,999
was promising for kovat 19
patients

3803
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:36,999
Armstrong admits he supports the

3804
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,999
president but Democrats
correctly

3805
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:41,999
cautioned that this drug remains

3806
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,999
unproven for the coronavirus
well let's

3807
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:46,999
say that the president didn't
bring this

3808
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:48,999
drug up well we would be having
this

3809
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,999
conversation now I wonder sir
that is

3810
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,999
about the best question I've
had so far

3811
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,999
and I don't think so I don't
think this

3812
02:48:58,000 --> 02:48:59,999
would even be a conversation
honestly no

3813
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,999
I think the news reporting
would be

3814
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:06,999
hopeful results good news

3815
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:10,999
senior saved elder's it's not a
death

3816
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:12,999
sentence I mean all of this
could have

3817
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,999
no but no and when all is said
and done

3818
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:17,999
and ten years from now when we
look back

3819
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,999
we're gonna see that there was
a lot of

3820
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:21,999
stuff that could have been done
that the

3821
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,999
actual hate of the president
not even

3822
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,999
the pregnant heat of a man a
man with

3823
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:32,999
orange hair resulted in death
yeah these

3824
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:34,999
Democrats are murderers and
Democrats

3825
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:36,999
Democrats the idiots it's an if
the

3826
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,999
media as many Republicans that
hate

3827
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:43,999
Trump too but this is political
if they

3828
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:45,999
do everything you keep hearing
about

3829
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:47,999
hydroxychloroquine is totally
political

3830
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,999
the Democrats doctors and the
rest of

3831
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:51,999
them oh no it's no good

3832
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:53,999
and the Republicans yeah it's
good it

3833
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,999
works we've done it I mean come
on when

3834
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:00,999
is this gonna end it's gonna
end in the

3835
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:05,999
election in November no agenda

3836
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:07,999

03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:26,999
Corona in Brazil and Africa
which is an

4063
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:28,999
interesting little report not
so in

4064
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,999
Brazil which is emerging as a
serious

4065
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:33,999
epicenter even though President
jarba

4066
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:36,999
Sanaa rose supporters still
cheer him on

4067
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:40,999
he's provoked outrage as a Cova
denier

4068
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,999
who still won't social distance
on this

4069
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:45,999
weekend he went for a
provocative spin

4070
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:48,999
on a jet ski as the number of

4071
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,999
coronavirus deaths past 10,000
local

4072
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:54,999
authorities put a Kovach
message on

4073
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:56,999
Rio's famous Christ the
Redeemer statue

4074
03:01:57,000 --> 03:02:09,999
have a heart wear a mask 10,000
dead and

4075
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:13,999
we have 80 pushing 90,000 yeah
and we

4076
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:15,999
shut down the country in Brazil
didn't

4077
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,999
and our population is 350
theirs is 250

4078
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,999
so their part their numbers
should be

4079
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:23,999
hired I mean it looks like an
experiment

4080
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:25,999
they don't want to do because
Boston our

4081
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:28,999
Boston our bowls an arrow is is
a bright

4082
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,999
wing or supposedly a kind of a
piece of

4083
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:34,999
business oriented guy they've
left press

4084
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:36,999
down there hates him they cause

4085
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:38,999
basically oh I'm a fascist and
so you

4086
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:40,999
got the same kind of politics
going on

4087
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:42,999
with Brazil you know what I
want their

4088
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:44,999
numbers aren't really being I
don't

4089
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:46,999
think their numbers are high
enough - no

4090
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:47,999
they're not no they're not but
you know

4091
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,999
just just throw in surge and
dead and

4092
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:53,999
whatever so you have to see the
Statue

4093
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:56,999
with with that big to see the
Statue

4094
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:58,999
person that's a beautiful
statue what I

4095
03:02:59,000 --> 03:02:59,999
think we should do he

4096
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,999
America is we should put a big
mask on

4097
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:04,999
the Statue of Liberty yes I
think that's

4098
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:06,999
exactly what I was thinking was
there a

4099
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:06,999
mask 

4100
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:10,999
let's go to Africa in Africa and

4101
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:12,999
Southeast Asia the virus does
appear to

4102
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,999
be spreading more slowly maybe
because

4103
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:17,999
the population tends on average
to be

4104
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:20,999
younger Wow that's all you got
you don't

4105
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:22,999
have anything about
antimalarials okay

4106
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:26,999
but no one is sure and it's
quite

4107
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:29,999
possible that the worst is yet
to come

4108
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,999
yeah Serge it's quite possible
worse is

4109
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:34,999
yet to come they can't stand it

4110
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,999

03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,999
his update on progress of
testing and

4114
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:46,999
tracing this invisible killer
but can

4115
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:48,999
you confirm the people of West
dr. ship

4116
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:49,999
that the new systems that we
are putting

4117
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,999
in place will in for some time
be able

4118
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:56,999
to detect local flare-ups mr.
sandy mr.

4119
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:57,999
speaker the intention is that
the

4120
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:01,999
decoded alert system in time
will be

4121
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,999
sufficiently sensitive and
flexible as

4122
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,999
to detect local flare-ups so
that for

4123
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:11,999
instance if a the code is
detected in

4124
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:13,999
the water supply of a certain
time or

4125
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:15,999
well then then steps can be
taken on

4126
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,999
this path so people immediately
went

4127
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:23,999
what Congress did coronavirus
can be in

4128
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:26,999

the sewage system

much for

03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:39,999
the water supply in England no
kidding

4133
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:42,999

funded to be offensive

4194
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:06,999
it's all so short-sighted look
at what

4195
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:08,999
President Trump is saying his
idea I

4196
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:11,999
like his idea is let's get
negative

4197
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:14,999
interest rates and then
ultimately when

4198
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:16,999
you take out a loan for school
you'll

4199
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:18,999
get paid for it

4200
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:21,999
it's real simple I don't
understand why

4201
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:23,999
people don't understand this is
great I

4202
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:25,999
can't wait for negative
interest rate

4203
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:28,999
