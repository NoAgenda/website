1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
John C Dvorak: rubbed me the
wrong way you get blocked.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,960
Adam Curry: Adam curry Jhansi
Dvorak October 22 2023 This is

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,810
your award winning accumulation
media assassination episode

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:15,750
16 01 This is no agenda,
clutching my pearls and

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,840
broadcasting live from the heart
of the Texas country here in

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,050
FEMA Region number six in the
morning, everybody. I'm Adam

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,500
curry

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,590
John C Dvorak: from Northern
Silicon Valley, where we're

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,380
concerned that Canada is pushing
assisted suicide for babies. I'm

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,190
Jhansi Dvorak.

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,820
Adam Curry: It's about time they
got in on that on that action.

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,610
Baby killing is all the rage. So
it's like hey, we're not gonna

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,090
let a masa Israel have all the
fun. Is this really something?

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,710
Are they really doing assisted
suicide?

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,700
John C Dvorak: Back board I
think is to kubek medical board

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,780
is pushing it and they're trying
to get it through. Babies up to

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,740
one and

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,830
Adam Curry: the babies get to
decide is that how that worked

19
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,040
out?

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,440
John C Dvorak: Of course. No, I
did. This is this is a form of

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,840
abortion after the fact.

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,190
Adam Curry: Yes, it's post natal
abortion. Pap, you

23
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,260
John C Dvorak: look at it. I
don't like that baby.

24
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,990
Adam Curry: says like, look at
the nose on that

25
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,330
Unknown: kid. Yeah, no good. Oh,

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,480
Adam Curry: it's as red hair.
Oh, no, it's a ginger. Oh, hello

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,580
social media addicts. Remember
when social media was social

28
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,300
networking?

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,690
Unknown: Wow. Yeah.

30
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,080
John C Dvorak: I'm talking about
Wow. Which is that's kind of an

31
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:43,440
interesting while you're right.
I got a robo call today. Did you

32
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,400
know and it was it was the I
considered some someone who

33
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,770
coded it was very ironic. It was
a woman calling it was a robot

34
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,100
robot. Hi, I'm Eliza. Oh,
really? Yes.

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,340
Adam Curry: Wow, that's not
obvious. I'm Eliza. How are you?

36
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:14,250
i Oh, man. Now this this Israel
Hamas thing is perfect. I mean,

37
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,090
it's better than mask no mask
Vax Novak's could you know when

38
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,820
you say something like all of a
sudden you're a Nazi you it goes

39
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,400
a little further. Now you can
you can get in real trouble now.

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,150
You're anti Semite. Yeah. So,
but yes, it used to be social

41
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,510
networking. And I think that the
turn to social medias when they

42
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,740
brought in the algos?

43
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,980
John C Dvorak: Oh, you know, I
don't think so. I think it was

44
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:44,220
the social networking, I think
was always borderline passive.

45
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,910
Adam Curry: Right. There was no
comments. You're right. Yeah, it

46
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,420
was just, it was like a, like
Google Reader. That was that was

47
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,590
that was social? No, no,

48
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,720
John C Dvorak: I think Facebook
would be considered social

49
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,910
networking. And I think until
Twitter came along with micro

50
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,950
blogging, I think it was always,

51
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,860
Adam Curry: I think, I think
it's, I think it's the algo I

52
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,620
think it happened when the algo
was introduced. That's when

53
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,470
because media, look, networking
is just, hey, look, I'm

54
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,070
networking with some people. I'm
in a group. Yeah, following some

55
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,960
people, but Facebook. But then
Facebook got their feed their

56
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,100
news feed, and that was all algo
eyes. And then it became media.

57
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,870
I mean, media is always
dishonest. I think it actually

58
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,340
doesn't really even matter. I've
done some study. You know, we're

59
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,870
John C Dvorak: We're all ears.
Yes.

60
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,160
Adam Curry: So we've talked
about noster nostril, as you

61
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:45,060
call it. And a big discovery so
Nasir is this decentralized is

62
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,730
basically Twitter decentralized
and a lot of Bitcoin bros like

63
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,780
it because you can zap each
other with with little bits of

64
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,960
Bitcoin. But it's it's really
not all that great. And I think

65
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,550
the Bitcoin bros like it's
censorship resistant. Okay. So

66
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,080
there's really one, one app that
does this that does noster

67
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,760
really well. And this one app
got an investment or maybe just

68
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,440
to a stipend from Jack Dorsey.
So oz. Great. And that's called

69
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,880
Domus. That's the name of this
app. Get it Nostradamus. So the

70
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,870
Dominus guy. I know the dumbest
guy posts. He says, hey, you

71
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,800
know, we looked at our app store
stats. And it turns out that

72
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,160
after three months, 99% of the
people who've tried this app,

73
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,200
give up on it. And you know, it
was baffling to me. And I can

74
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,650
tell you why. Because you get on
this app and there's no action.

75
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,370
It's not yelling at you is not
giving you stuff to follow them

76
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,200
because there's no algos,
there's nothing. That's

77
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,450
John C Dvorak: a good point. I
don't know if the algos create

78
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,540
the action or not, but they sure
don't. They don't

79
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,850
Adam Curry: hinder it. There's
no highlighting there's no

80
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,710
trending. I like the

81
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,690
John C Dvorak: idea you're right
people yeah Lynnette each other,

82
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,280
that's where it's like watching
a fight.

83
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,110
Adam Curry: So and that is so
now entered no algos fight, but

84
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,140
we have mastered on. And I know
I've been. I've been looking

85
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,930
very closely at what's been
going on in our own Mastodon

86
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,870
server, which doesn't happen.
Yeah, and hates you now. But

87
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,040
that's what's that's what's so
interesting is it's like love

88
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,640
hate. It's everyone. Everyone
just needs that little that

89
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,730
little hit that little I had
posted something on any social

90
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,160
if someone commented whoa
doesn't agree with me that's

91
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,660
even better. No, it's like I say
something simple like I don't

92
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,810
like memes and now it's like a
hate meme don't hate means there

93
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,290
was a poll, Aaron er who runs
the whole? The whole instance

94
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,410
said no, we should have a mean
free Monday. Everyone's mad not

95
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:49,020
bad. You're addicts, you're
addicts is 100% addiction to

96
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,770
this, this is probably even a
better high than you get from

97
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:57,120
some drugs. Because the same
mechanism, this is what Silicon

98
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,440
Valley figured out decade ago.
It's is the end. So anything

99
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,910
that feeds that and again, this
Hamas Israel thing is fantastic.

100
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,810
Because you can just go back and
forth and call people names and,

101
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,890
and the algo throws it up in
your face. And it's great. I

102
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,740
mean, the troll room is a little
different. The troll room is

103
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,590
like, I'm gonna go to a party,
I'm gonna binge to like puke.

104
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,620
You know, that's kind of what
that is just you just throw some

105
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,850
bombs. And people you get
immediate feedback. I think and

106
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,360
yes,

107
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,090
John C Dvorak: I agree that is
different. I think it's still

108
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,070
social media, but it's of a
different sort.

109
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,830
Adam Curry: It's binging it's
like a binge fest, and I'm just

110
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,010
gonna go and cram as much dope
into me as I can until I puke

111
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,890
and then I'm good. And then
here's something else.

112
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,200
John C Dvorak: Well, it also
comes and goes, you don't dwell

113
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,200
on things right, bro. Yeah,
exactly. Well, I'm dwelling

114
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,550
factor. I think it's a big deal.

115
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,740
Adam Curry: But if you get
kicked off by me, you know,

116
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,190
that's like you're either a
general of the troll room, then

117
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,060
you have massive props. So and
then I've noticed something

118
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,050
else. Now I don't I don't have
this per se. But I've seen

119
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,450
friends and I think I think
women more than anything, maybe

120
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,690
I'm not sure. On text messages.
So they have a text message

121
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,290
thread. And they're just sending
memes back and forth about the

122
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:18,690
news. And you know, like thumbs
up has a good one. And but

123
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,420
there's no there's not like this
like meme ship. There's not even

124
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,960
a it's not even a friendship.
They just shoot memes back and

125
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,170
forth. It's a completely empty
relationship. It's like it's

126
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,550
like, sex without love. I don't
know what it is. This people

127
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,290
really need to sit down the
phones for a day. It's not

128
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,730
healthy. What's going on? Hey,

129
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,889
John C Dvorak: okay, talking to
the wrong guy.

130
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,679
Adam Curry: I know. I know. I
know. I know. Now,

131
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,470
John C Dvorak: of course I still
since December. You

132
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,510
Adam Curry: haven't touched your
phone. I know. You're a master.

133
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,910
John C Dvorak: I don't have an
account anymore. I'm gonna have

134
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,200
to. Yeah, I'm gonna try to get
back before No, no, no.

135
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,190
Adam Curry: But this is also why
you are now at five years old is

136
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:04,740
because you have not succumb you
have kept all of your all your

137
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,930
John C Dvorak: keeps the blood
pressure down.

138
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:11,789
Adam Curry: Exactly. You have
healthy blood pressure. You You

139
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:17,219
haven't worn out all of your
your brain cells. And what's the

140
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:20,939
you haven't you know, dopamine
you actually have for sex? Not

141
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:26,669
just for you I get you with that
one. No, so this is good. This

142
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:32,909
is that's why be like John cook
for yourself. Don't don't have

143
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:36,899
your phone and just don't use
your phone at all. Look at the

144
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:38,939
look at the trains.

145
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,420
John C Dvorak: Great dad goes a
train.

146
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,620
Adam Curry: And I think
personally the genius move and

147
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,890
not everybody can do this is
love your wife in a different

148
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,320
state. I mean, this is just you.

149
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,130
John C Dvorak: You've got an
always a winner.

150
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,540
Adam Curry: Anyway, so I've
figured a couple things out with

151
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,310
the with the M five M is already
abusing this entire situation.

152
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,380
And before we get to it though,
first we have to have these

153
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,850
because CNN is loving this. We
got ratings again, we got guys

154
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,510
with helmets. We got we got
chicks with flak jackets to say

155
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,620
media press. We have dangerous
situations. We got cool sound

156
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,100
effects. And what happened on
CNN this morning. I mean, you

157
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,730
could ask for a better ratings
Buster than this. So you are

158
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,480
Unknown: seeing this sort of
solidarity that was called for

159
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,870
by the way by from all over the
Arab world and the world of

160
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,750
like, but you were also seeing
the journalists gathered here

161
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,790
because this is kind of where
the crash happens. All right.

162
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,250
All right, you see that people
are very angry to do not like

163
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,720
recording the story. You hear
that?

164
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,810
Adam Curry: Yeah. All right. I
mean, that's dynamite for

165
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:21,420
ratings. Good job there in the
fields. Her name is what's your

166
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:27,450
name? Her name is? Sarah. So
what's your name? Sara Sidner. I

167
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,690
think Cersei there's good job
for a raise give her Erin

168
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,790
Burnett. Let's stir it up a
little bit. Come on, Aaron. Go

169
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,050
go go what we see

170
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,750
Unknown: Sarah dealing with on
the ground and Ramallah

171
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,780
obviously, you know, it is so
important, right? These are pro

172
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,510
Palestinian protests. But
there's also the perception of

173
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,510
where the media stands where
American media stands. You are

174
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,540
not welcome here. There is an
anger and resentment and a rage

175
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,740
and it is real real and it is.
It is a part of the story as

176
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,000
well pro Palestinian, anti
Israeli anti American, the this

177
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,930
John C Dvorak: right there for a
second. We have absolutely no

178
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,120
evidence that this whole thing
wasn't staged.

179
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,540
Adam Curry: Thank you very much.
And I'm going to show to you

180
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,280
that the probably was

181
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,190
Unknown: and it is important and
it is a part of the story as

182
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,420
well pro Palestinian, anti
Israeli anti American. The this

183
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,740
is this is often one big giant
soup. And it's very hard to pull

184
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,500
those strings apart as that
moment with Sarah I think just

185
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,670
illustrated so well.

186
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,610
Adam Curry: It's a soup I tell
ya. It's one giant soup. We

187
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,480
don't know what to do.
Unfortunately for CNN, ABC was

188
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,540
the first of the punch. Whenever
you really want to go over the

189
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,540
top with any type of attacking
force. You got to bring this in.

190
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,670
It's it's a good old friend of
the show.

191
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,070
Unknown: And we're learning that
Hamas terrorists who attacked

192
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,150
Israel may have been high on a
drug designed to make them feel

193
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,230
invincible. The drug Captagon
was reportedly found on the

194
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,430
bodies of terrorist and in the
vehicles used in the attack

195
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,980
Adam Curry: member our old
friend Captagon if it wasn't the

196
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,510
Russians, it was it's all I
forgot all about it. Yeah, on

197
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,060
the Captagon that drugged out
it's a powerful

198
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,020
Unknown: amphetamine known as
the poor man's cocaine. Experts

199
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,220
say to drug may explain some of
the extraordinary ferocity seen

200
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,300
in the attack. Former DEA Deputy
Chief of Staff Jim Crotty with

201
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,050
Captagon and other illicit
substances, they just tend to

202
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,830
strip people of all their
humanity. They do things that

203
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,980
they wouldn't ordinarily do.
There's very little to stop them

204
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,800
from committing all sorts of
atrocities. But drones makes

205
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,970
users take crazy risks, like
this terrorist wearing a helmet

206
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,940
cam who walked right into
Israeli gunfire.

207
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,850
Adam Curry: Yes. Hi, man.
They're all jacked up on poor

208
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:43,590
man's cocaine. We have this is
from I think this is maybe one

209
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,950
of your clips 2019 background
you're on Captagon

210
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,890
Unknown: Lebanon's Bekaa Valley
has a history of smuggling and

211
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:53,790
trafficking of all sorts, an
area where illegal activities

212
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,960
include narcotics Achmed is one
of those who transports and

213
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,130
sells that type of amphetamine
called Captagon Ichie been a

214
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,380
hugely popular drug in the
Middle East.

215
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,580
Adam Curry: Oh, so it's not just
for fighters. It's just in the

216
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,900
Middle East in general. All
right. Cannon ethylene always

217
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,690
bring back the Captagon if you
want to make it just a little

218
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:20,250
more fun there. Hi, man, the
crazy and everything was going

219
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,640
swimmingly well, and I've been
waiting for something to pop up

220
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:30,870
and there it was in DC. We had a
pro Palestinian protest. And

221
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,850
well, I happen to catch this on
local Fox five and I went down

222
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,600
the rabbit hole.

223
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,660
Unknown: Just days after
hundreds of arrests in the canon

224
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,510
building right here at the US
Capitol. More demonstrations

225
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,840
popping up on the National Mall.
Let's get to Stephanie Ramirez

226
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,310
joining us live. Steph, what is
the sentiment out there today?

227
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,730
People are marching in the pro
Palestinian ceasefire rally

228
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,850
there is no doubt if you don't
hear it out here. The calls for

229
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:04,740
a ceasefire in Gaza have
definitely increased I want to

230
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,430
show you a crowd here. This is a
organized protest that was

231
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,390
permitted for Around 100 people
but we're seeing today a little

232
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:12,810
bit different

233
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,020
Adam Curry: you don't need to
hear the whole report she said

234
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,200
it right there. This was an
organized protest professional

235
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,240
signs. Ha as a no agenda
conspiracy therapist This is

236
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:36,210
where we start the main sign was
want to second pray for the dead

237
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:44,280
fight. What was that pray for
the dead fight for peace. Now

238
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,990
this is typically fight like
hell for peace. That's when the

239
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:53,190
union's use it. But they didn't
find it appropriate to put hell

240
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:58,140
in here I guess. And these signs
were made by the if not now.

241
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:04,830
Movement organization who if not
now movement.org Quickly we are

242
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,980
if not now a movement of
American Jews organizing our

243
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,610
community for equality, justice
and a thriving future for all

244
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,300
our neighbors ourselves,
Palestinians and Israelis. We

245
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,940
are Jews of all ages with
ancestors from across the world

246
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:21,000
and Jewish backgrounds as
diverse as the ways we practice

247
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,290
our Judaism. Okay, so I'm trying
to figure out who's behind this

248
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,820
who's funding this and here is a
nice little bit in their in

249
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:35,370
their on their website after the
war ended now this was a

250
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,700
previous war that there were
protesting against the founders

251
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,100
joined the momentum organizing
community I didn't that didn't

252
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,970
ring any Bell. The same
community were sunrise movement

253
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,480
and by the people and many more
organized for a brighter future.

254
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,830
Wait a minute sunrise movement?
Isn't that those kids who go

255
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,450
we're going into Nancy Pelosi
his office. So I'm like, oh,

256
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,860
okay, so this is organized.
Let's go to the momentum

257
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:10,890
movement and momentum very
interesting little outfit here.

258
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,360
They we offer training and
support to movement organizers.

259
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,540

support to hone organizers

opinion, developing a hundreds

261
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,380

1000s we are committed to both

262
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,530

resources, they've got guides,

264
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,060
they're a community of movement
leaders and they've apparently

265
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,530
no not apparently they have
organized this if If not now,

266
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:47,550
movement organization. So what
let's look at this they have a

this is? Not blue X blue. Of

plant Auntie, I'm just replant

Auntie whining In their waste

318

things afrofuturist, Octavia
Butler and Marvel universe this

320
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,640
is the whole page is filled with
this kind of people

321
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,450
John C Dvorak: that are complete
crackpots.

322
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,820
Adam Curry: And they're
organizing and training the

323
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:26,910
children of all these schools,
all these protests. It's all

324
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,140
part. It's all

325
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,090
John C Dvorak: political people.
It's

326
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,720
Adam Curry: all political and to
prove it, who shows up in the

327
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,310
Atlantic with an article titled
Netanyahu, his attack on

328
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:42,930
democracy left Israel
unprepared, none other than an

329
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,220
apple bomb, oh, our friend and
and says this summer I spent

330
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,010
several days in Israel talking
with people who were afraid for

331
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,830
their country's future. They
were not at that moment focused

332
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,250
on terrorism, Gaza or Hamas,
they feared something different,

333
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,870
the emergence of an undemocratic
Israel, a de facto autocracy.

334
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,410
I'm just skipping ahead. Thanks
to the financial and logistic

335
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,680
support of the Israeli tech
industry, the most dynamic

336
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,950
economic sector in the country
as well as to organize teams of

337
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,360
people coming from academia and
the Army Reserves. The protests

338
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,330
kept going for many months
successfully blocked many of the

339
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:23,100
proposed legal changes. This is
all about the fascist the

340
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:28,020
dictator Netanyahu. And here we
get into the meat of it. The

341
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,050
deep angry divides in Israeli
politics divides that are

342
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,260
religious and cultural, but that
were also deliberately created

343
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,710
by Netanyahu and his extremist
allies for their political and

344
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,770
personal benefit weren't just a
problem for some liberal or

345
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:44,190
secular Israelis. The people I
met believed the polarization of

346
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,120
Israel was an existential risk
for everybody is worse than

347
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,830
climate change. Earlier this
year, the head of Shin Bet the

348
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,250
Israeli domestic intelligence
service warned that Israeli

349
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,730
settlers who were attacking West
Bank Palestinians pose a

350
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,300
security threat to the country.
One member of Parliament from

351
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,120
net now whose Likud party
responded using language that

352
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,560
will sound familiar to
Americans. Quote, The ideology

353
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,860
of the left has reached the top
echelons of the Shin Bet the

354
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,310
Deep State has infiltrated the
leadership of Shin Bet and the

355
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:24,600
IDF. And here it comes. If
Donald Trump becomes president,

356
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,090
again, they made deliberately
set out to weaken the

357
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:30,300
institutions themselves. Yes,
this is exactly what we're

358
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:35,370
seeing here. This is all about
training the Democrats to make

359
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,190
sure that Trump doesn't get
elected. It's all about Trump

360
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,990
all about Trump. These protests
are about Trump, the all of this

361
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,130
stuff. These trainees are hate
Trump. They're all trans

362
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,000
Maoists. They're bad for America
and probably bad for your

363
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,800
children. Well, the whole thing
is about politics, all of it.

364
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:06,660
All of it. And some of it is
about obviously the military

365
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,720
industrial complex that's foxes
job really, you know, they're

366
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,780
supposed to, oh, CNN has the
generals on it like that. But

367
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,710
here's judge Jeanine

368
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,800
Unknown: In fact, I would say
bomb a bomb and then bomb again.

369
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,670
That's a new one.

370
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,890
John C Dvorak: It's a new one
that's totally new. Yeah,

371
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,830
Adam Curry: that's she's she's
completely gone back to her old

372
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,190
bomb bomb bomb again that she
has this she loves bombing

373
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:26,490
people.

374
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,980
Unknown: You have this one to
loading bomb stealing. You're

375
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,010
getting new pilots in. But
they're going in and they're

376
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,240
going in hard. They know that.
That their their existence

377
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,170
depends on this.

378
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:41,730
Adam Curry: She's she I think
she digs it, man. She's like,

379
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,600
Oh, yeah. So hot. They're gonna
go in hard. Hard. Here's the

380
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,230
last one.

381
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,660
Unknown: Somebody's going to
drop a new care. I don't know

382
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,730
who it is. But I don't want to
watch it.

383
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,740
Adam Curry: What does that even
mean? Judge Jeanine? Somebody's

384
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:00,480
gonna drop a nuke here. What is
wrong with these people? Got it

385
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,280
other than they're out there
doing any

386
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,290
John C Dvorak: help and things
as for sure. No, of

387
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:09,360
Adam Curry: course not. It's
horrible. It's horrible. And

388
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:15,600
social media playing right into
it is beautiful. The whole thing

389
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,520
is a perfect setup. Everybody's
spinning out. Oh, yeah, I'm

390
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:26,220
going crazy. So great. Oh,
there's we got to have a

391
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,420
telegram telegram

392
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,630
John C Dvorak: is both a
messaging and social media app.

393
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,020
People in the United States and
across the world. Use it to

394
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,770
video call and text message each
other or someone can set up a

395
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,990
group to send messages to
followers.

396
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,720
Adam Curry: By the way, Rumble
was already on the way out

397
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,040
telegram is next.

398
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,190
John C Dvorak: That second use
is what we've seen most during

399
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,730
the Israel Hamas war. When Hamas
attacked southern Israel on

400
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,420
October 7, their channel was
flooded with propaganda videos

401
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:58,020
showcasing their training and
the fight against the nearby

402
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:02,040
Israel Defense Forces. Both the
Hamas account and the one for

403
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,670
its military wing. The Al Qassam
brigades have grown

404
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,700
substantially since the war
began. The Hamas account has

405
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,900
gained more than 100,000
followers while brigade account

406
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,120
has fallen.

407
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,830
Adam Curry: So here is Deutsche
revelat. That was Scripps news.

408
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,080
That's just you know, they're
promoting it more than anything.

409
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,310
Deutsche chavalla is

410
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,450
John C Dvorak: I would mentioned
Scripps news is really is really

411
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:32,220
a very questionable source of
news. I've been watching the TV

412
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,280
feed, it's borderline
disgusting.

413
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,070
Adam Curry: Do you know who owns
most of Fredericksburg?

414
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,290
Unknown: Scripts? You bet.

415
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,280
Adam Curry: Oh, yep, yep.

416
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,250
John C Dvorak: You bet.

417
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,310
Adam Curry: I received it. I
remember

418
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,400
John C Dvorak: even when I said
I almost said 100% I stopped

419
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,000
myself.

420
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:54,180
Adam Curry: I know I'm working
on myself. I'm trying I'm trying

421
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:59,670
I really am. Yep, yep, yep, yep.
Yep. Yep. As far as I know, nice

422
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,760
people actually but the the news
is

423
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,610
John C Dvorak: long gone from
this system that

424
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,070
Adam Curry: don't run it
anymore. So here's Dorabella

425
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,890
telegraphing about telegram.

426
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,530
Unknown: Another front and the
fast evolving conflict between

427
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,760
Israel and Hamas is the one
found online. Disinformation is

428
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,600
running rampant across social
media where millions turn to get

429
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:25,530
real time updates. And with the
very real imagery or floods of

430
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:29,580
fabricated videos and photos
spread by both fake and real

431
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:33,570
accounts. The companies behind
giants like Facebook X and tick

432
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,060
tock say they've taken
additional steps to tackle

433
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,210
disinformation around the
violence. But the EU has

434
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:43,530
reprimanded social media
companies for not doing enough

435
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,220
and about all that we can now
speak to Caitlin chin Rothman,

436
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,440
she's with the Center for
Strategic and International

437
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,190
Studies, where she researches
the impact of technology on

438
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,340
geopolitics and society.
Caitlin, good to see you. Lots

439
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,920
of people these days getting
their information on social

440
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,270
media, With tensions running so
high. How are both sides in this

441
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:06,330
conflict using social media to
share views of the war,

442
00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:12,119
we've seen? Both Hamas and the
Israeli government use posts on

443
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:15,839
social media quite often, Hamas
has been posting on a platform

444
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:19,229
called telegram which is less
popular in the United States in

445
00:27:19,229 --> 00:27:21,929
the EU, but more popular in
other parts of the world, like

446
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:25,979
Russia and Ukraine. Telegram has
very loose content moderation

447
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:30,509
policies, which has allowed moss
to post very graphic or violent

448
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:33,449
images from its initial attack
on October 7,

449
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:37,229
I want to look a little closer
at telegram that you just

450
00:27:37,229 --> 00:27:39,509
mentioned because it's used by
Hamas, not only to spread

451
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:44,129
propaganda, but also to recruit
new members now is an

452
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:48,629
internationally recognized
terror organization. By much of

453
00:27:48,629 --> 00:27:51,989
the West at least, can the
platform be held accountable for

454
00:27:51,989 --> 00:27:52,349
that.

455
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:59,010
So it's very difficult and have
very loose content moderation

456
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,520
laws, so platforms are generally
not held accountable for third

457
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,480
party content that users upload.
Now that is different. In other

458
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,030
countries, especially the EU,
which recently passed the

459
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:13,800
Digital Services Act. And the
online service, online safety

460
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,280
bill in the United Kingdom is
about to come into effect. Now,

461
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,360
Telegram has not seen as much
regulatory attention from the EU

462
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,870
or the UK, I think partly
because it's just not as popular

463
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:30,000
in in either jurisdiction. But I
think going forward, I would

464
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,120
expect governments to become
more interested in how telegram

465
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:36,060
operates, especially if we
continue to see violent

466
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,480
extremist content emerge on
these platforms in real time or

467
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,320
situations.

468
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,400
Adam Curry: This is the perfect
moment to clamp down on these

469
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:48,780
because of course we're in a in
an election season. A very good

470
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,290
moment to start clamping down on
this stuff because clearly,

471
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:57,540
telegram is a recruitment tool.
Yes, PBS has some short little

472
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,390
note here and all the horrible
things from social media

473
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,660
Unknown: to European Union press
to meta and tick tock to explain

474
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,510
what they're doing to block
disinformation about Israel

475
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,510
Hamas war Do you know air tech
giants were given one week to

476
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,720
respond? They could face
billions in fines if they don't

477
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,960
comply with a new law aimed at
protecting users from false

478
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,970
claims and other harmful
content.

479
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:22,770
Adam Curry: And this brings us
to a gripe a lot of people have

480
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:28,500
with me, but are you with me and
also with you? Me the Oh yeah.

481
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:35,490
Yes, you and this is because we
poo pooed and I would say

482
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,240
slammed the Westminster
declaration

483
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,960
John C Dvorak: da Qing was Adam
curry.

484
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:47,219
Adam Curry: Yes where Pearl
clutching I read an email Lord

485
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:51,839
Hi Imperator curry. Greetings
from FEMA Region Deep South New

486
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:54,329
Zealand. I need to take

487
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,420
John C Dvorak: Oh New Zealand,
this New Zealand In New Zealand

488
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,240
but they have What the hell's a
New Zealand are got to do With

489
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,410
anything that has to do with
this American

490
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:08,579
Adam Curry: ship is just
indicative of several emails and

491
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:09,809
tweets and tweets I

492
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,330
John C Dvorak: received. It
sounds sounds fake but go on

493
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,200
reading now it's

494
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,620
Adam Curry: not fake and you
just did a Kara Swisher but go

495
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,540
ahead. But go ahead go,

496
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:21,929
John C Dvorak: Wait a minute.
That was my invention now you're

497
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:23,159
crediting her with it.

498
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,329
Adam Curry: I need to take issue
with the tone of your no agenda

499
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:31,199
story and the Westminster
declaration. You are downright

500
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:36,959
snide and your trademark MTV
snare so new you know

501
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:41,099
John C Dvorak: him reading this
letter is snide. He already

502
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:43,769
shrewd straight up with other
things you

503
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:47,640
Adam Curry: are downright snide
with your trademark MTB sneer

504
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:52,170
was used to in effect on a group
of people merely highlighting

505
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:55,620
the censorship regimes being
installed in Oh, Western

506
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,970
democracies. Why wouldn't you be
supportive of this? I expected

507
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:04,170
immediate fierce pushback from
Jhansi Dvorak but nothing he

508
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:08,340
joined you, the snidely brothers
brothers in harm's

509
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,529
John C Dvorak: unkindly
brothers. I love it

510
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,340
Adam Curry: uncool in the gang.
Kiwi Paul,

511
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:17,579
John C Dvorak: I'm cool in the
gang. Holy mackerel. This guy

512
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:18,809
should be a copywriter.

513
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:23,219
Adam Curry: He's good. He's
good. He's good. So I we have

514
00:31:23,219 --> 00:31:27,659
been doing this since episode
133. We have to do it every five

515
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:32,699
to six years. And we're going to
do it again. I will start off by

516
00:31:32,699 --> 00:31:37,019
saying the Westminster
declaration was released on the

517
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:44,429
very day, the very day the FCC
voted and agreed to create new

518
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:48,629
rules for the reintroduction of
net neutrality. I'm sure it's

519
00:31:48,629 --> 00:31:53,069
just a coincidence. Although I
say there's no coincidences in

520
00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:59,759
the kingdom. And they say they
want article 19 to be observed

521
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,389
and adhered to, from the
Universal Declaration of Human

522
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:08,339
Rights. Now, any no agenda
person should immediately think,

523
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:12,989
Hmm, that's the United Nations
document, maybe not the best

524
00:32:12,989 --> 00:32:16,199
thing in the world. But doesn't
matter. Let's look at article

525
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:20,819
19. Article 19 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

526
00:32:21,449 --> 00:32:23,849
Everyone has the right to
freedom of opinion and

527
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:28,319
expression. This right includes
freedom to hold opinions without

528
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,339
interference and to seek,
receive and impart information

529
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:37,499
and ideas through any media and
regardless of frontiers. So

530
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:41,159
that's what you're really going
to bat over. May I remind you,

531
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:45,179
Glenn Greenwald, Mata Eb, these
are leftists, just because you

532
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:51,569
agree with them on lock downs
and vaccines and what doesn't

533
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:56,219
mean that they're not inherently
they they love government

534
00:32:56,219 --> 00:33:01,499
regulation. That's what these
guys love they, they thrive on

535
00:33:01,499 --> 00:33:06,869
it. You will not get free speech
from commercial platforms or

536
00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:11,399
maybe from anything called a
platform at all. And what they

537
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:15,149
are calling for in my mind
because it coincides exactly

538
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:20,729
with the vote, which was three
to two is net neutrality. And we

539
00:33:20,729 --> 00:33:24,599
have had so much pushback in the
past about our stance on net

540
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:27,599
neutrality. And people said, why
wouldn't you want it to be

541
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:33,809
neutral man? Because net
neutrality is as honest as the

542
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:38,579
sorry is always net neutrality
is as honest as the inflation

543
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:42,029
Reduction Act. Haven't we
learned these things by now?

544
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:46,409
When they call it something? It
means the opposite? Did you like

545
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:49,919
your cell phone alert from the
government? Did you everyone was

546
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,529
bitching and moaning about hey
man, the government taking over

547
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:57,149
my phone? That'll be on every
computer you own? If this goes

548
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:01,109
through, and this will lead to
digital ID that is the end game

549
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:04,589
of what they're really asking
for. Anonymity will end there

550
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:10,109
goes your trolling because they
want title to to adhere to the

551
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:16,079
internet. Now I listened to FCC
chair Rosen Borssele. She was on

552
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,939
the FCC panel back during Obama
when they went through this the

553
00:34:20,939 --> 00:34:27,959
first time. And she is now the
chair. And I want to go through

554
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:33,119
a few things from her speech and
subsequently play a few

555
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,209
historical no agenda clips
because we've been through this

556
00:34:36,209 --> 00:34:40,649
before. You don't want it. You
do not want the government with

557
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:43,349
their net neutrality is a trick

558
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:45,959
Unknown: but you know, the
pandemic did something else. It

559
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:49,889
made crystal clear that
broadband is no longer just nice

560
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:54,779
to have. It's nice to have for
everyone everywhere. It's not a

561
00:34:54,779 --> 00:34:59,969
luxury. It's a necessity. It is
essential infrastructure for me

562
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:05,579
Modern life. No one without it
has a fair shot at 21st century

563
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:10,319
success. We need broadband to
reach 100% of us. And we need it

564
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:13,259
to be fast, open and fair.

565
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,840
Adam Curry: Okay, this is the
slogan, go get the bumper

566
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,060
sticker, get your T shirt fast,
open and fair. Now I've not I

567
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,240
don't have a huge argument with
the idea that everybody should

568
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,810
have broadband. For some reason
we've never been able to really

569
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:31,350
get it together. Even though
we've spent hundreds of millions

570
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:35,910
of dollars given that to
telephone companies to create a

571
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,730
broadband for everybody
broadband for all this goes back

572
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:44,760
to Obama. It just got stolen.
But a portion of the country

573
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,120
still doesn't have it. But
that's really the ruse using the

574
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,450
pandemic, all man. Well, without
broadband we couldn't leave.

575
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:55,770
John C Dvorak: When we do that,
is that lame is rousse? That

576
00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:00,570
ruse is the one who can't wait,
what is brought what is one got

577
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,030
to do with the other COVID had
nothing to do with the you know,

578
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,120
Adam Curry: when we were locked
down. That's that's what she was

579
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,170
at this show. But

580
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,970
John C Dvorak: you go to school?
Yes,

581
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,400
Adam Curry: I chopped a whole
bunch out of this for obvious

582
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,840
reasons. So what she wants, he's
on par with the telephone

583
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,440
networks

584
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:20,130
Unknown: back in the era when
communications meant telephony

585
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,340
each and every call went
through. And the phone company

586
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,720
could not cut you off from your
call or decide to edit the

587
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,940
content of your Converse. What

588
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,100
Adam Curry: do you want to say
something here?

589
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:36,210
John C Dvorak: What world was
she living in? When you had to

590
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,660
put a quarter in and you hit the
you got the yak, yak, yak and

591
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,210
then you click, you're done.
They cut you off? What do you

592
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:45,360
mean, they never cut you off?
They cut you off all the time.

593
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,310
This so where does that debt
imaginary scenario come from?

594
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,670
Adam Curry: This is to trick
everybody into wanting this.

595
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,840
She's lying. I'll get to that.
Is it a blatant lie? Oh, there's

596
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,400
another Whopper coming up

597
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:03,030
Unknown: from your call or
decide to edit the content of

598
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:06,630
your conversation. Now fast
forward to the present.

599
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,330
Communications means a whole lot
more than just phone calls. It

600
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,850
means access to the internet,
because broadband is the most

601
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,040
important infrastructure of our
time.

602
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,030
Adam Curry: No the important,
important she's she's very

603
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,990
young, important.

604
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,670
Unknown: But as a result of the
previous FCCS decision to drop,

605
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,410
abdicate authority. The agency
charged with overseeing

606
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:36,630
Communications has limited
ability to oversee these

607
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,710
indispensable networks, and make
sure that for every consumer,

608
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,320
their access is fast

609
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,440
Adam Curry: note that she talks
about consumers if you're a

610
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,820
creator, screw you,

611
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:52,230
Unknown: open and fair. I think
that's not right. It's not

612
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,840
right. Because for everyone
everywhere to enjoy the full

613
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,710
benefits of the Internet age,
Internet access should be more

614
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:03,090
than just accessible and
affordable. The Internet needs

615
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:03,510
to be

616
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:07,140
Adam Curry: what is more than
just accessible and affordable.

617
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,810
John C Dvorak: Seems like
accessible. And affordability is

618
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:13,350
really what it's all about. Oh,
you want what more could you

619
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,370
want? Oh, hold

620
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:19,740
Unknown: on. And affordable. The
Internet needs to be open. And

621
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,450
that's what I want to talk it is
open

622
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:26,370
Adam Curry: now. No, she wants
when when the government says I

623
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:30,510
want it to be open, please read
that as I want it to be closed.

624
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,570
John C Dvorak: How is it not
open right now? No, wait,

625
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,300
Adam Curry: they want to close
it off? Yeah, I want to close it

626
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,030
off. Here we go. We're next
clip. Let's

627
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:43,560
Unknown: start in 2005. That was
when the FCC adopted its first

628
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:47,190
open Internet policy statement
which was built on policies that

629
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:51,540
had long been in communications
law and history. The agency made

630
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:55,170
clear that when it came to net
neutrality, consumers should

631
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:58,350
expect that their broadband
providers would not block

632
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:03,270
throttle or engage in paid
prioritization of lawful

633
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,320
internet traffic.

634
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:07,710
Adam Curry: And there's my
favorite word Yeah, there we go.

635
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:12,630
Not lawful content, lawful
internet traffic and I have a

636
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:15,390
copy if anyone I've marked it up
if you want to go through the

637
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:21,120
entire proposed rulemaking, 126
pages. The term lawful traffic

638
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:26,670
and lawful transfer is all over
this thing. This is the main

639
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,470
problem. This is the trick.

640
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,930
Unknown: In other words, your
broadband provider had no

641
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:35,910
business cutting off access to
websites slowing down Internet

642
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:39,900
services and censoring online
speech, which never

643
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:40,770
Adam Curry: happened.

644
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,680
John C Dvorak: There's not one
example of that your broadband

645
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,160
brought the broadband internet
provider just provides the

646
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,550
broadband he doesn't. He's not
Twitter, they barely do

647
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:53,370
Unknown: that. Your broadband
provider was not allowed to play

648
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:58,710
favorites like steering you fast
to some online service that

649
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,640
hadn't given them a payout. It's
never happened, and assigning

650
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,290
you to a bumpy road for those
who have not offered, the same

651
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:07,680
never

652
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,380
John C Dvorak: happened. You're
right. This is all bullcrap. But

653
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:15,420
But I hope you get to the end
here because I want to know go

654
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,220
is your spiel about lawful

655
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,130
Adam Curry: now we're getting to
that this is a presentation.

656
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,310
These clips are all very short.
It's an important presentation.

657
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:27,600
And the next part is her
explanation of why title to the

658
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:33,600
same regulation for your phone,
your phone line. And there's

659
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,030
regulation, there's a lot of
stuff you can do on the phone.

660
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,320
And the government, I think I'm
pretty sure the government

661
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,540
completely can hear and do
anything they want on your phone

662
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,930
networks. But we need title two
now for the internet. Here's why

663
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,900
Unknown: title two is the part
of the law that gives the FCC

664
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,550
clear authority to serve as a
watchdog watchdog over the

665
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:00,330
communications marketplace and
look out for the public

666
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:00,930
interest.

667
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:04,290
Adam Curry: Okay. I'm from the
government. I'm here to help.

668
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:05,340
Title two

669
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,800
Unknown: took on special
importance in the net neutrality

670
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,430
debate, because the courts have
ruled that the FCC has clear

671
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:16,530
authority to enforce open
Internet policies. If broadband

672
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:19,290
internet is classified as a
title to service,

673
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,380
Adam Curry: very important what
she's saying here, not saying

674
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,020
that the Court said you should
you should be doing this. They

675
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:29,970
say if it is classified as title
two, then the FCC has absolute

676
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,560
authority over the internet.
Just trust uncle Adam and Uncle

677
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,820
John, you don't want this.

678
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,910
Unknown: And providing a strong
foundation for net neutrality

679
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:42,360
rules is a good reason to
support classifying broadband

680
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,560
internet as a title to service.
But again, there are downstream

681
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,550
consequences that flow from the
agency retreating from title to

682
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:53,520
Adam Curry: downstream
consequences that flow that

683
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,750
doesn't sound healthy,

684
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,180
Unknown: and they need
attention. So let me explain.

685
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:01,290
Back to the pandemic, it made
clear that broadband is

686
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:04,650
essential infrastructure for
modern life. access to the

687
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,980
internet is now access to
everything gets access to

688
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,640
everything. And common sense
tells us that the nation's

689
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,020
leading communications watchdog
should have the muscle it needs.

690
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,760
Adam Curry: Muscle must

691
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,190
John C Dvorak: you give me a
high blood pressure?

692
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,010
Adam Curry: I got a ball you
don't have a phone. I need to do

693
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:26,820
something to kill. Yeah. Yes,
you want to say something?

694
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:32,670
John C Dvorak: You know,
listening to this is very

695
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:35,670
annoying, because I know that
other people were laughing must

696
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:38,520
be laughing it out. And I would
include the people that signed

697
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,840
that document. Yes, I lapping it
up not realizing that it is a

698
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,110
trick we're getting complete.
We're getting to the trick trick

699
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:46,500
getting

700
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,740
Unknown: to the trick should
have the muscle it needs to

701
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:53,790
protect consumers and make sure
their internet access is fast,

702
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:54,480
open

703
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:58,410
Adam Curry: and fair. Now to a
big lie. Here's a big lie.

704
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:02,340
Unknown: On one issue after
issue classifying broadband as a

705
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,450
title to service would help the
FCC serve the public interest

706
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,990
more efficiently and
effectively. So let's start with

707
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:14,520
public safety. And it's remanded
the FCC has decision to rollback

708
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,750
net neutrality. The court found
the agency's disregard of its

709
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:22,560
duty to analyze the impact of
public safety renders the

710
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,120
decision arbitrary and
capricious. I agree. Here we go.

711
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,970
The record before the court
demonstrated that when

712
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:33,420
firefighters in Santa Clara,
California, were responding to

713
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,710
wildfires, they discovered that
the wireless connectivity on

714
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,900
their command vehicle was being
throttled.

715
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:47,700
Adam Curry: Lie, that's a lie,
because we reported on this in

716
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:54,570
Episode 1079, November 21 2018.
Let's go back and let's listen

717
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:59,640
to what the story really was.
And was it not Verizon, that

718
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,240
came into a very bad light?
Because they cut off the

719
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,940
firefighters in California
because they had run out of

720
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,980
data? Bastards. That's was
Verizon, correct? I believe so.

721
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,490
And so the so these guys had the
they couldn't use their account,

722
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:16,800
they had to switch to a
different account according to

723
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,340
the Verizon rep, because they'd
run out of data. And of course,

724
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,220
these guys have they're fighting
fires and they needed data. And

725
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:30,690
so it was it was a bad PR story
for Verizon. Let me just go back

726
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,270
and listen to what the FCC
Chairwoman lied

727
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,670
Unknown: the record before the
court demonstrated that when

728
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:39,150
firefighters in Santa Clara,
California, were responding to

729
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:43,530
wildfires, they discovered the
wireless connectivity on their

730
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:45,660
command vehicle was being
throttled. It

731
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:50,730
Adam Curry: was not being
throttled. So she's lying. As

732
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:54,930
usual, liars. All right. So what
else? What do they really want

733
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:57,600
to do? Well, well, you know,
we're not just here to make sure

734
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,970
you get cheap and affordable
broadband. No

735
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,970
Unknown: Good cybersecurity
security SEC is actively

736
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:06,600
involved in federal interagency
cybersecurity planning,

737
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,710
coordination and response
activities. You want the expert

738
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,080
agency with all sorts of
knowledge about network

739
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,000
technology to be sitting at that
table

740
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:21,930
John C Dvorak: at the stop it in
Michigan. So this FCC, there's

741
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:26,190
so hot shit, blended done
anything about to 10 or 20, robo

742
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,390
calls I get a day,

743
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,680
Adam Curry: I'm glad you asked

744
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,950
Unknown: then look at privacy.
The law requires

745
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:36,210
telecommunications providers to
protect the confidentiality of

746
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:41,160
the proprietary information of
their customers. That means

747
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,240
these providers cannot sell your
location data, among other

748
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,740
sensitive information. Well, I
suppose not machines currently

749
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,280
extend to phone service
customers, but not to broadband

750
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,080
subscribers, because title two
does not cover the ladder. Does

751
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,380
that really make sense? Do we
want our broadband providers

752
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,830
selling off where we go and what
we do online? Scraping our

753
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:08,250
service for a payday Oh, new
artificial intelligence models

754
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,040
doing any of this without our
permission?

755
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:14,490
Adam Curry: Yeah. So you were
one clip ahead of me. Exactly.

756
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,850
The robocalls still continue,
they have done nothing with

757
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:20,730
their title to authority to stop
that nothing, no,

758
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,040
John C Dvorak: nothing zip and
they could do something if they

759
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,340
wanted to. And And meanwhile,
this bowl credit, this other

760
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:30,930
stuff is all bull crap. The
providers aren't tracking us.

761
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,170
Apple might be tracking us.
Google might be tracking us

762
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:35,580
these are providers.

763
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,420
Adam Curry: So I pulled two
clips. So we don't have to, you

764
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:44,280
know, just because we're lazy.
We don't have to really go over

765
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:49,410
everything all over again. You
see what happened? What is this?

766
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:49,800
What is this?

767
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,050
John C Dvorak: But I may revisit
my old columns. I've been

768
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,820
writing about this for a decade.

769
00:46:53,850 --> 00:47:02,280
Adam Curry: This is no agenda
episode 950. And that is from

770
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:06,090
that is from July 27 2017.

771
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,860
John C Dvorak: This is Greg
Wald, and he's a Republican from

772
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:14,550
Oregon. And he is the Hayes and
this is an oversight

773
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,850
subcommittee. But he's actually
the head guy of the Energy and

774
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:21,810
Commerce Committee. He's the
chair and he is a very powerful

775
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:25,200
person. And just listen to the
question he asked this is net

776
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,560
neutrality basics opening,
including Comcast

777
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:33,120
Unknown: AT and T, Verizon and
Charter Communications, inviting

778
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:37,590
each of them to come and testify
before our full Energy and

779
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:41,610
Commerce Committee. It's time
for Congress to legislate the

780
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:46,680
rules of the internet, long game
of regulations and litigation.

781
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:50,250
And make no mistake given the
importance of this public policy

782
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:53,970
debate. And the work we need to
do as a committee. It is

783
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:57,420
essential that we hear directly
from the country's top internet,

784
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:01,170
and edge provider leaders who
frequently speak out publicly

785
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:05,310
about rules of the internet. His
time they came before us and

786
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:08,910
directly shared their positions,
and answered our questions.

787
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,800
Adam Curry: Wow. Yeah, I think
there's some subtext, there

788
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,370
Unknown: is a little more than
subtext. Time to stop

789
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:19,800
Adam Curry: this, these series
of tubes.

790
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,580
John C Dvorak: That's the guy
when he said, quote, it's time

791
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:27,300
for Congress to legislate the
rules of the internet Boom

792
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:31,680
shakalaka. Could it be any more
clear? Does anybody out there

793
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,160
listening

794
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:40,260
Adam Curry: to podcast licenses
coming? That's what will happen

795
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,950
with net neutrality. That's what
happens with title two, it's

796
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:48,300
time to legislate the rules of
the internet, hate speech is

797
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:54,000
already illegal in 49 states,
whatever that means. Now, to the

798
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,390
genesis of our reporting, we go
back to 2009. No agenda, Episode

799
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:05,100
133. And this brings back the
Core term here the fifth

800
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:09,630
principle of non discrimination.
The fifth principle is one of

801
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:12,270
non discrimination stating that
broadband providers cannot

802
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:15,450
discriminate against particular
Internet content or

803
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:20,190
applications. This means they
cannot block or degrade lawful

804
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:23,760
traffic over their networks or
pick lawful traffic. Okay, so

805
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,770
that means they're gonna have to
sniff it. I mean, it's all in

806
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:28,710
here, right? You can just see
what they're doing lawful

807
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:34,260
traffic, what is lawful traffic?
Okay, all traffic is lawful.

808
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:34,530
It's

809
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,420
John C Dvorak: so I think we
should just sorry that we should

810
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:42,480
declare that the last 20 years
was the golden age of porn. It's

811
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:42,750
all

812
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:46,620
Adam Curry: over. It's all over.
That's right. They cannot

813
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,410
disfavor an internet service
just because it competes with a

814
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:53,580
similar service. This principle
will not prevent broadband

815
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:57,270
providers from reasonably
managing their networks during

816
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:00,180
periods of network congestion.
For example, it may be

817
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,840
appropriate for providers to
ensure that very heavy users do

818
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:09,030
not crowd out everyone else,
like BitTorrent users. And this

819
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:12,120
principle will not constrain
efforts to ensure a safe, secure

820
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:16,020
and spam free internet
experience. I don't want a safe,

821
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,740
secure spam free internet
experience. I want porn. I want

822
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:23,730
popups. I want all kinds of
viruses. That's what makes the

823
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:33,120
internet cool. And there it is.
We've been doing this for 16

824
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,960
years. You don't want your
Westminster declaration from a

825
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,740
bunch of bunch of, by the way,
the Westminster declaration.

826
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:44,250
Isn't that bizarre, like against
catechism or something that was

827
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,310
like, it's like a bunch of
atheists hijacking some

828
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,630
religious vibe. I

829
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:51,360
John C Dvorak: have no idea. But
you do not. It was a reference

830
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,460
to something else. You don't

831
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,760
Adam Curry: want net neutrality.
It sounds great. But just

832
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,610
remember net neutrality is as
honest as the inflation

833
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:00,540
Reduction Act.

834
00:51:00,779 --> 00:51:03,239
John C Dvorak: Well, let's get
back to the this lawful thing,

835
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:06,149
which is a pet peeve of yours
and I think is the crux of the

836
00:51:06,449 --> 00:51:12,839
basis. That's the crux, which is
torrents will be illegal you

837
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:17,489
have a Tory packet sniffer tour
will be illegal season sees the

838
00:51:17,489 --> 00:51:22,409
door Torian whatever you want to
call it. Yeah, advertising, it

839
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:26,009
sees it says up nap no good.
This means anyone out there who

840
00:51:26,009 --> 00:51:30,089
thinks you're gonna download
music or or big giant files from

841
00:51:30,089 --> 00:51:34,079
each other, or I think they'll
probably put the archive.org got

842
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,429
a business and everything in
between. This whole thing is a

843
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,200
Adam Curry: it's always about
copyright. Of course, it's

844
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,380
always driven by the movie or
the movie companies. Yeah, they

845
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:43,680
always

846
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,100
John C Dvorak: losing 10 cents
or a buck. Because you know,

847
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:51,900
there's somebody's downloaded an
old copy of some movie from the

848
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:56,760
30s. And they could have
probably maybe big somebody,

849
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,600
there's no available copy of it.
But you know, Turner Classic

850
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,240
Movies likes to play it once a
year. And so you're you're

851
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:05,100
you're taking money for even
though they don't do

852
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,650
advertising, but you're still
taking their bread and butter

853
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:10,590
away. I mean, this whole thing
is always about the movie

854
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:16,800
industry. It's about the the,
it's about the content to cut

855
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,720
the copyrighted content and how
it's, I own it, I get to do what

856
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,470
I want with it.

857
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,630
Adam Curry: So throughout this
entire document, these are the

858
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:30,990
things you need to be looking
out for. And this is their

859
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:35,130
proposed rules. And this will
take a little bit, but they've

860
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:38,370
gone through the initial hurdle
of and that was three weeks

861
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:40,890
after the speech and that was on
the 19th. So it was on our last

862
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:44,100
show day they voted three to two
good to go. We're gonna go move

863
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:47,130
forward with the rulemaking
process the same day those

864
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:51,480
Yahoo's came out with their with
their Westminster declaration,

865
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:54,720
in order to fit the technical
and economic realities of the

866
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,990
broadband ecosystem. The
restrictions on blocking and

867
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:01,140
discrimination will be made
subject to an exception for

868
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:05,340
quote, reasonable network
management, allowing service

869
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:09,630
providers the freedom to address
legitimate needs, such as

870
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:14,700
avoiding network congestion and
combating harmful or illegal

871
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:21,180
content. Well, go look at go I
mean, this is this is exactly

872
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:26,820
what you don't want. Because
it's open to interpretation.

873
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,930
What is harmful?

874
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:33,240
John C Dvorak: Yeah, vibe
antivax information that was

875
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:39,600
accurate about the about the
about the vaccine. Is that

876
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:44,310
harmful force? Of course, people
think it is. So So you know, you

877
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:46,830
have one group of people that
think that information is good

878
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:50,010
and valuable. And another group
say, Oh, it's terrible. It's

879
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:52,500
making people so they're
reluctant to take the VAX.

880
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:55,590
Adam Curry: Additionally, we
propose to reinstate a general

881
00:53:55,590 --> 00:54:00,000
conduct standard that would
prohibit practices that would

882
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,420
cause unreasonable interference
or unreasonable disadvantage to

883
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:10,410
consumers or edge providers. So
what is reasonable? They don't

884
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:15,060
define it, of course, no, you
can't define it. No. And then

885
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:19,140
it's safeguarding national
security. So the NSA is going to

886
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:22,170
be in the network, they're going
to have to be able to safeguard

887
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:24,870
it's for your protection. All of
this is for your protection.

888
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:29,040
Commission's efforts in
coordinating with coordination

889
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,830
with other agencies will be
protecting the nation's

890
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:36,030
communications network from
entities and equipment and

891
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:41,640
services. That pose I mean,
listen to this equipment and

892
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:45,030
services that pose threats to
national security and law

893
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:50,010
enforcement. Someone's using
graphene OS. Orange Alert.

894
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:53,520
Orange Alert. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Someone has a non approved

895
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,250
device. Yep. Yep. Someone has a
non approved device connected to

896
00:54:56,250 --> 00:55:01,260
it. And we these efforts will be
pursued into Presidential Policy

897
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:05,400
Directive 21. But go look at
that. That's a doozy, which

898
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,090
tasked the commission FCC with
identifying communication sector

899
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:12,240
vulnerabilities, and working
with industry and other

900
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,990
stakeholders to address those
vulnerabilities and increase the

901
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:19,920
security and resilience of this
critical infrastructure within

902
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,670
the communication sector. And
here's my favorite. Another

903
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:26,520
initiative is the Commission's
inquiry into vulnerable

904
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:30,270
vulnerabilities threatening the
security and integrity of Border

905
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:35,730
Gateway Protocol, which impacts
the transmission of data from e

906
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:40,200
mail, e commerce and bank
transactions, two interconnected

907
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:45,150
Voice over IP and 911 calls. The
Commission noted that border

908
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:48,240
gateway protocols initial
design, which remains widely

909
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,870
deployed today does not include
security features to ensure

910
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:57,420
trust in the information it is
used to exchange. This is going

911
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:02,400
after DNS. They want DNS they
want they want to be able to

912
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,650
disconnect your entire network
segment.

913
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:11,790
John C Dvorak: See, they want to
be able to pull the plug in who

914
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:15,360
they don't like yes and who they
don't like. It allows

915
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:19,020
Adam Curry: a bad network actor
to deliberately falsify BGP

916
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:22,140
reachability information to
redirect traffic to itself

917
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,960
through a specific third party
network, which means that's what

918
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,100
they want to do, but you said
being self Alright, man, we

919
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,310
should be able to redirect us
and prevent traffic from

920
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:35,940
reaching its intended recipient.
reclassification would provide

921
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:38,610
the commission with additional
authority to address BGP

922
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:42,630
vulnerabilities. There's enough
dudes named Ben out there who

923
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:50,550
know that this is nuts so so
when we have these these

924
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:56,460
intellectual Dark Web people all
lefties Brett Weinstein all all

925
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:01,350
leftists who are saying hey,
man, we should be able to we

926
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:06,810
shouldn't be kicked off of
Twitter or Facebook. And that

927
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:09,270
should be fair we should about
to say we want to say you're

928
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:13,560
gonna get it you're gonna get
exactly what you want. get

929
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,730
exactly what you want.

930
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,890
John C Dvorak: I wonder who is
behind that thing? I don't

931
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:21,210
believe it was tyy or Greenwald
or not guys who initiate face

932
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,460
these things. Had to be someone
else that's

933
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,740
Adam Curry: a good point. I'm
just

934
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,690
John C Dvorak: one of those get
there's a there's a troublemaker

935
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:30,360
in that group. You got to get
got the

936
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:33,600
Adam Curry: well crowd riled up.
Well, it's Greenwalt anti EB are

937
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,700
leading the charge at the top of
the list.

938
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,740
John C Dvorak: Yeah, that's what
you'd put if I was putting

939
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,050
something together like that,
that those are the two guys they

940
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:43,740
got two big numbers. They got a
lot of attention to themselves.

941
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:47,310
They seem legit in every way. I
would put them at the top of the

942
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:50,910
list too. But I would, I'd be
there's got to be somebody that

943
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:52,560
organized this and it wasn't
them.

944
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:55,500
Adam Curry: That's a good plus,
look at the list again. So Ty EB

945
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,640
Shallenberger

946
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:59,010
John C Dvorak: Shellenberger
sounds more like it.

947
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:03,840
Adam Curry: Yeah, Shallenberger.
And he Well, he's he went to

948
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,180
court. I mean, and again, I
agree with a lot of the things

949
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:09,690
Shellenberger has said and done.
Yeah, but he's, but he's

950
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:14,520
misguided. Jonathan Haidt, ha ha
IDT. He's, he's written a lot

951
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:19,770
about bad things that happen to
people with social networks. I'm

952
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:24,990
Steven Pinker. These that's his
partner. I think Julian Assange

953
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:25,710
is on here.

954
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,610
John C Dvorak: To get him to
sign anything.

955
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,640
Adam Curry: I don't know Tim
Robbins is on onboard. He's

956
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:38,610
right at the Robins. I think Tim
Robbins. I doubt it. John Cleese

957
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:42,270
biggest Wait. Hey, man, we need
to leave Oliver Stone all left

958
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:42,810
this?

959
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:45,030
John C Dvorak: Yeah, the Oh
yeah. All of them.

960
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:49,140
Adam Curry: Jordan Peterson,
Barry Weiss, Peter Hitchens.

961
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:54,750
Niall Ferguson. Yanis Varoufakis
a Marxist.

962
00:58:56,190 --> 00:59:00,090
John C Dvorak: Yeah. Open
Marxist. Yeah. So that is a

963
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:04,830
couple open Marxists on there.
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, there's no

964
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:08,520
right what name one right
winger? I mean, you might make

965
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:12,540
the argument that Peterson is
kind of a right winger, but I

966
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:16,410
don't know I don't know. But he
but there's name a you know,

967
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:19,980
some. You have classic, classic,
classic classic people listed on

968
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,190
there. But you don't have the
classic people on the right.

969
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:24,060
There's nobody

970
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:27,750
Adam Curry: no, no, they needed
a John C Dvorak and Adam curry

971
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,580
on this list and they if there's
money in it

972
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:34,080
John C Dvorak: a lot of these
people are very well put your

973
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,120
names off these things. People a
lot

974
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,390
Adam Curry: of these people are
wealthy too. Not all but many of

975
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:39,900
them are

976
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:42,570
John C Dvorak: quite well and
one last thing about the net

977
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:44,700
neutrality thing we have to
remember because they keep

978
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:50,070
saying it's got to be fair and
you know cheap. I use one of my

979
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:54,090
networks is Sonic. Sonic has two
programs. They have a gigabit

980
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:57,930
and they have a two gigabit.
Well, I have to pay more for the

981
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:01,230
two gigabit that would be kicked
off That's kicked off the planet

982
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:05,580
because I, there's no why would
it? That's unfair gotta have to

983
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:08,940
pay more to get to a higher
speed free. Everything would be

984
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:13,470
downgraded faster your speeds
will go down with net neutrality

985
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:17,250
fast, open and fair. So it
because everyone has to have the

986
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:21,060
same speed, it's a way of
leveling the playing field,

987
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:23,550
meaning you're gonna get
whatever the minimum is.

988
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,060
Adam Curry: Is everyone happy
with their telephone service?

989
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:29,400
Now that's under Title two.

990
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:32,820
John C Dvorak: Yeah, I'm still
getting the calls, I get a call

991
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:33,510
from Eliza.

992
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,690
Adam Curry: The robot had that
so that worked really well.

993
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,590
Anyway, I put a link in to open
internet.gov, the archive.org

994
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:46,710
version because that was the
previous you can just you can go

995
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:50,850
review. That was the previous
website. That's gone now of

996
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:58,200
course. Yeah, you got to spam
free internet. No, if someone's

997
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,510
telling you, you can get a spam
free internet than they are

998
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:03,270
sniffing packets or doing
something.

999
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:07,140
John C Dvorak: That's a lie.
What they're doing is lying

1000
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:07,620
there.

1001
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:10,500
Adam Curry: Because they want
control. And even the

1002
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,130
Republicans as you heard,
they're ready for it. Yes, it's

1003
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:17,310
time to moderate that thing. And
why are they doing it? They're

1004
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:19,470
doing it now because they want
to get stuff rammed through so

1005
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:23,550
they can control elections.
control what's going on during

1006
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:25,170
elections? It's obvious.

1007
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:27,990
John C Dvorak: Yeah, so they can
keep Trump out.

1008
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:33,780
Adam Curry: It all comes back
down the Trump. She's a Wesleyan

1009
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:36,480
grad. Exactly. Well,

1010
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,100
John C Dvorak: let's talk about
the campaign then. With a little

1011
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:46,200
overview. This is the clip is
1024 campaign is about 2024 Just

1012
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:48,180
put the one in there for you by
accident.

1013
01:01:48,899 --> 01:01:52,409
Unknown: And not a Democrat may
soon enter the 2024 presidential

1014
01:01:52,409 --> 01:01:56,369
race challenging President Biden
for the nomination. This comes

1015
01:01:56,369 --> 01:02:00,089
as a new poll today shows former
President Trump is leading over

1016
01:02:00,089 --> 01:02:04,499
Biden and a potential 2024
matchup. Entities area and past

1017
01:02:04,499 --> 01:02:06,149
our house and election update

1018
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:09,480
back my bipartisan pathways to
Congressman Dean Phillips is

1019
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:13,080
reportedly planning to enter the
2024 presidential race.

1020
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:16,320
Political reports the Minnesota
Democrat could challenge

1021
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,920
President Biden for the
Democratic nomination. Phillips

1022
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:23,220
is reportedly laying the
groundwork in key early states,

1023
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,980
paving the way for the
announcement of his presidential

1024
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:30,240
run. This comes as a new poll on
Friday shows former President

1025
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:35,100
Trump is leading over Biden in a
potential 2024 matchup. The new

1026
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:39,540
Emerson College poll shows that
47% of voters say they'd vote

1027
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:44,460
for Trump 45% say they're
supporting Biden, less than 10%

1028
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:48,060
are undecided. The same poll
gives Trump an even stronger

1029
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:51,630
lead when it comes to young
voters. Emerson found that Trump

1030
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:55,920
leads Biden by 11 points in
voters in their 30s. Just on

1031
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,130
Friday, Trump attacked Biden on
truth social for the president's

1032
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:02,670
handling of International
Affairs. Trump says the Israel

1033
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:05,460
War started because of the Biden
administration and their

1034
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,970
policies of weakness and
appeasement. He added this is

1035
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:12,360
true also with Ukraine, Russia,
which would never have started

1036
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:15,600
under the Trump administration
and many other hotspots around

1037
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,690
the globe that could easily lead
to big problems and deaf.

1038
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,320
Meanwhile, Republicans with less
approval in the polls are

1039
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,500
fighting each other, especially
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis,

1040
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:28,620
and former South Carolina
Governor Nikki Haley. The two

1041
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:32,220
went back and forth all week
long on the issue of taking in

1042
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:36,450
refugees from Gaza. Now just on
Friday, Haley released a new

1043
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:39,480
campaign at directly targeting
DeSantis

1044
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:42,180
Adam Curry: I find it very
interesting that she still is

1045
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:44,910
out there and trying to get some
some

1046
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:47,549
John C Dvorak: actions get big.
She's got big Silicon Valley

1047
01:03:47,549 --> 01:03:51,239
money behind I think she has big
oil money behind her too. Yes,

1048
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:54,029
she's got money. She got lots of
money that she hasn't got she

1049
01:03:54,479 --> 01:03:57,329
Money doesn't buy charisma.
Charisma. She

1050
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:58,260
Adam Curry: got her asthma.

1051
01:03:58,649 --> 01:04:00,659
John C Dvorak: She hasn't got
that she hasn't got enough of

1052
01:04:00,659 --> 01:04:04,469
that to get by. Which is a shame
for her. But I don't like her

1053
01:04:04,469 --> 01:04:07,829
policies anyway. She's really
anti Trump. She's pro war. She

1054
01:04:07,829 --> 01:04:09,149
might as well be a neocon. He's

1055
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:11,040
Adam Curry: very pro war. Yeah.

1056
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:14,910
John C Dvorak: The law McGann

1057
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:21,300
Adam Curry: the big anti Trump
news that we had to stop, you

1058
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:25,320
know, breaking news by the way,
notice that all the NBC channels

1059
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:30,300
they're you know, they're all
pro Palestine and it's not

1060
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:33,630
because they hate Jews or care
about Palestinians. It's because

1061
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:38,700
Trump that's their base their
their viewers are the people who

1062
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:43,020
are mind controlled by these by
this this outfit to go out and

1063
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:47,430
protest. It's all it's all
antitrust. It's all political,

1064
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:50,460
has they? They're actually the
worst people in the world

1065
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,580
because they really don't care.
Either way. They don't care

1066
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:56,520
who's killed or who's whose
babies heads are chopped off

1067
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,610
faster than the other. They
don't care. It's about Trump.

1068
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,150
And boy where the network's
happy with this news Sydney

1069
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:04,380
Unknown: Catherine Powell she

1070
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:06,870
was at the center of Donald
Trump's effort to overturn his

1071
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:10,680
2020 laws publicly pushing
outlandish claims of election

1072
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,890
fraud and privately meeting with
the former president inside the

1073
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:17,370
White House. But tonight, just
one day before her trial was set

1074
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:21,240
to begin, Sidney Powell pleading
guilty and agreeing to cooperate

1075
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,770
with prosecutors. Miss Powell.
Do

1076
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:26,370
you understand the charges that
are against you here today?

1077
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:29,670
Do Paolo spread the false
conspiracy theory Georgia

1078
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:32,550
election machines were
controlled by Venezuela even

1079
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:35,250
pointing a finger at the
country's former dictator Hugo

1080
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:36,540
Chavez, who was dead.

1081
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:42,600
This was exported from Venezuela
and by Maduro and by Mr. Chavez.

1082
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:47,940
This is the consummate foreign
interference in our election in

1083
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:48,270
an Oval

1084
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:51,540
Office meeting on December
18 2020. Powell allegedly

1085
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:54,780
suggesting Trump name her
special counsel to investigate

1086
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:57,510
election fraud. In that same
meeting, Trump and his team

1087
01:05:57,510 --> 01:06:00,930
allegedly weighed seizing voting
machines, even declaring martial

1088
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:03,750
law. As part of her plea deal.
Powell is now required to

1089
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:06,600
testify against her co
defendants, including the former

1090
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,110
president.

1091
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:11,130
Adam Curry: So that's the ABC
version and by the way, what she

1092
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:16,470
so what she pled guilty to a
plea deal, which is probably

1093
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,870
what she needed to do to not,
you know,

1094
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:23,550
John C Dvorak: yeah, I have I
have another clip about the

1095
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:27,570
other guy who just did the plea
deal after she did. And if you

1096
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:31,230
listen, if you listen to it, and
read between the lines is the

1097
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:34,350
Georgia clip says Georgia, if
you read between the lines or

1098
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:37,320
listen between the lines, these
guys are doing this just to say

1099
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:39,600
I mean they're not getting any
jailer and they're doing it to

1100
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,800
save their their

1101
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:44,490
Adam Curry: day go broke
pocketbook. I only have Georgia

1102
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:46,140
plea bargain too. Is there a
one?

1103
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:48,210
John C Dvorak: Unfortunately no.

1104
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,300
Unknown: A northern Georgia
defendant cuts a deal attorney

1105
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:54,540
Ken Chesbro gets five years
probation and exchange for

1106
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:58,350
cooperating with prosecutors.
That leaves 16 defendants

1107
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:01,830
including former President Trump
in the Fulton County Rico case.

1108
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:04,860
Here's more from Legal
Correspondent Arlene Richards.

1109
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:10,170
Another day another plea deal.
Third defendant in the sprawling

1110
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:14,040
Georgia election racketeering
case pleads guilty. He's the

1111
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:18,120
second attorney to do so but the
only one to accept a felony

1112
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:18,840
charge.

1113
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:22,620
How do you plead to count 15
conspiracy to commit filing

1114
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:27,510
false documents in indictment
number two three sc 188947.

1115
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:29,490
Guilty guilty

1116
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:33,330
attorney Ken Chesbro was facing
six felony charges in the

1117
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:37,230
election fraud case brought by
prosecutor Fani Willis against

1118
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:40,260
19. Defendants father,
prosecutor said she would have

1119
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:41,310
shown at trial.

1120
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:44,970
Adam Curry: I thought it was
Fanny now it's funny. It's funny

1121
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:45,930
how I love Yes,

1122
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:48,990
Unknown: several other
defendants entered into a

1123
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:52,440
criminal conspiracy to cause
certain other co conspirators

1124
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:58,500
including David James Shaffer,
Sean mica, fair Thrasher steel

1125
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:03,060
and Kathleen Austin Latham to
falsely hold themselves out as

1126
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:06,390
the duly elected and qualified
electors for the President and

1127
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:10,410
Vice President from Georgia
following the November 3 2020

1128
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:11,400
presidential election.

1129
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:16,230
Adam Curry: This is interesting.
So I think Georgia is one of the

1130
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:19,620
few places where you can be you
can put a whole bunch of things

1131
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:23,490
together and then call it a
conspiracy. So these conspiracy

1132
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:28,170
charges that that Sidney Powell
pled guilty to are misdemeanors,

1133
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:31,920
I mean, she's she got like,
$5,000 fine. And it was

1134
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:37,620
literally to commit
international interference with

1135
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:42,210
performance of election duties.
By him know what that means.

1136
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:42,990
Sydney, this,

1137
01:08:43,229 --> 01:08:45,959
John C Dvorak: this, this is one
of those situations where people

1138
01:08:45,959 --> 01:08:50,129
should realize that if the
government insert, especially

1139
01:08:50,129 --> 01:08:54,119
state governments that are
corrupt at the point at the

1140
01:08:54,119 --> 01:08:56,789
district attorney at the
district attorney level, and

1141
01:08:56,789 --> 01:08:59,249
they just want to go after you
by dumping stuff on you, and

1142
01:08:59,249 --> 01:09:03,089
they have an amenable judge
can't be it because most judges

1143
01:09:03,299 --> 01:09:05,399
that aren't you know, amenable
to this sort of thing that you

1144
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:07,559
said they just throw the case
out immediately. So we got

1145
01:09:07,559 --> 01:09:09,899
better things to do with our
time. But you had that

1146
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:15,029
situation. The perfect kind of
the perfect storm. Your screwed

1147
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:17,400
Adam Curry: friend of ours went
to jail for 18 months over

1148
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,600
something stupid or

1149
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:21,480
John C Dvorak: yeah, very
similar that da had a grudge.

1150
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:24,180
Adam Curry: Yep. And had a
relationship with the with the

1151
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:29,160
prosecution. Yep, there's no
harm, no financial harm, but off

1152
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:33,750
off to the big house. CBS their
version, Sidney Powell, the

1153
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:36,750
conspiracy peddling FORMER
ATTORNEY FOR FBI the way we do

1154
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,640
hang with criminals is kind of
cool to say when we're

1155
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,880
Unknown: President Donald Trump
sat in a Fulton County courtroom

1156
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:46,020
today and admitted to her role
in the breach of voting systems

1157
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:47,160
in Georgia. Are you

1158
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,350
pleading guilty today because
you agree that there is a

1159
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:51,780
sufficient factual basis that
there are enough facts that

1160
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:53,850
support this plea of guilty? And
then

1161
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:57,539
Powell was sentenced to six
years probation will pay 1000s

1162
01:09:57,539 --> 01:10:00,509
in fines and write an apology
letter to this citizens of

1163
01:10:00,509 --> 01:10:01,019
Georgia

1164
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:06,060
Adam Curry: love that. You have
to write on the blackboard 50

1165
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:09,510
times I will not commit this bad
conspiracy

1166
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:12,780
Unknown: along with Trump. She
was one of 19 defendants in the

1167
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,900
case brought by district
attorney Fadi Willis finally

1168
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:19,140
agreed to testify truthfully
against her co defendants at

1169
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,130
future trials.

1170
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:24,090
If I'm Donald Trump, or I'm
Donald Trump's lawyer, I would

1171
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:25,890
certainly not be happy.

1172
01:10:26,099 --> 01:10:29,159
Beyond Georgia Power was a
central figure in pushing

1173
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:31,079
Trump's false election denial
claim.

1174
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:34,920
President Trump won by a
landslide. In a now

1175
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:38,880
infamous December 2020 Oval
Office showdown, Powell pushed

1176
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,660
to cease voting machines to look
for fraud. And although Trump

1177
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:45,600
entertained her conspiracy
theories, some White House

1178
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,950
lawyers were appalled.

1179
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,540
What they were proposing,

1180
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:51,330
I thought was nuts, pounds
impact that's not

1181
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:54,270
Adam Curry: the same as being
appalled. He thought it was

1182
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:55,710
nuts. He wasn't appalled

1183
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:58,860
Unknown: by thought was nuts.
How's impact on Trump and others

1184
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,200
in the case could be
significant. You were

1185
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:05,520
ever in the room with Sidney
Powell. You are very, very

1186
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:06,210
nervous.

1187
01:11:06,299 --> 01:11:09,239
Adam Curry: Now what you notice
from the reporting and I had to

1188
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:13,199
go in I had to look for about 10
minutes to find out what she

1189
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:18,839
actually pled guilty to all of
this is they make it sound like

1190
01:11:19,079 --> 01:11:22,979
she committed some horrible
offense and they just, you know,

1191
01:11:23,009 --> 01:11:26,489
they don't actually tell you
what she pled guilty to. And

1192
01:11:26,489 --> 01:11:28,829
here's the final one from NBC
tonight.

1193
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:33,750
John C Dvorak: That last one was
ABC when I was CBS. Last one was

1194
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:39,120
CBS. CBS. I just want to mention
your comment about that was nuts

1195
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:43,320
and saying that was appalled. He
guy was appalled when he wasn't

1196
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:47,220
that's very different, I think
is a great example of slanted

1197
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:47,910
coverage.

1198
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:52,200
Unknown: NBC tonight once an
attorney then a co defendant now

1199
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:53,550
a cooperator. How do

1200
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:56,100
you plead to the six counts of
conspiracy to commit

1201
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,410
Adam Curry: once an attorney has
she been disbarred? I don't

1202
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:00,660
think she's been disbarred. Has
she been just I don't

1203
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:03,720
John C Dvorak: think so. What is
it in her day? Then? The bar

1204
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,830
dispersion not to a judge. You
know you're a criminal

1205
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:10,950
Unknown: Knight once an attorney
than a co defendant now a

1206
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:12,030
cooperator. How

1207
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:14,850
do you plead to the six counts
of conspiracy to commit

1208
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:17,880
intentional interferes with all
forms of election duties

1209
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:20,670
Adam Curry: guilty. So that was
interesting. NBC puts it right

1210
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:21,690
at the top of the report,

1211
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,960
Unknown: Sidney Powell, one of
19 charged alongside the former

1212
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,680
president in a sprawling
conspiracy to overturn the 2020

1213
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,890
election results in Georgia
pleading guilty to six reduced

1214
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:35,850
charges in court today, just as
jury selection for her trial was

1215
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:37,290
set to begin tomorrow.

1216
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:40,080
Do you agree that there is a
sufficient factual basis that

1217
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,720
there are enough facts that
support this plea of guilty and

1218
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,020
then

1219
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,270
Adam Curry: see what they're
doing? This is great.

1220
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,630
Unknown: Remarkable about face
for one of Mr. Trump's fiercest

1221
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:49,860
defenders. I'm going

1222
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:51,120
to release the Kraken

1223
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:52,860
pushing the basis.

1224
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:57,120
John C Dvorak: Oh, well done.
Not really crack and go. Kudos

1225
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,680
Adam Curry: kudos for NBC on the
crack.

1226
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:00,600
John C Dvorak: Very good edit
Gerawan gorilla

1227
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,660
Unknown: bout face for one of
Mr. Trump's fiercest defenders.

1228
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:07,290
I'm going to release the Kraken
often pushing baseless

1229
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:09,300
conspiracy theories the last
election,

1230
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:13,380
President Trump won by a
landslide, we are going to prove

1231
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:13,650
it.

1232
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:16,830
Instead, she's now admitted to
helping organize the breach of

1233
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:20,400
sensitive voting equipment in a
rural elections office agreeing

1234
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,130
as part of the new plea deal
with prosecutors to write an

1235
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:26,640
apology letter to the people of
Georgia handover documents to

1236
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:30,360
investigators and come clean
about all that she knows about

1237
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:33,750
her former client as Mr. Trump
continues to fight the charges

1238
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:34,410
against him

1239
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:38,550
Adam Curry: here to testify
truthfully, against any so this

1240
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:43,500
is interesting. So the the voice
over here says to come clean

1241
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:48,390
about all what everything she
knows and come clean. No. The

1242
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:51,360
only thing because right it's
followed by the truth. You will

1243
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,250
testify truthfully as part

1244
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:55,620
Unknown: of the new plea deal
with prosecutors to write an

1245
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:59,100
apology letter to the people of
Georgia hand over documents to

1246
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,820
investigators and come clean
about all that she knows about

1247
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:06,210
her former client as Mr. Trump
continues to fight the charges

1248
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:06,870
against him

1249
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:10,860
here to testify truthfully,
against any and all co

1250
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:13,560
defendants in this matter at any
upcoming proceedings.

1251
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:17,280
Pals testimony, likely an asset
for the Fulton County DA who has

1252
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,490
now managed to secure two guilty
pleas so far,

1253
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:22,830
Adam Curry: I mean to testify
truthfully doesn't mean that's

1254
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:25,740
an advantage to the prosecution.
No, it

1255
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:27,810
John C Dvorak: could be a
disadvantage, and she's probably

1256
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:30,450
Adam Curry: thought of yeah,
I'll testify truthfully. Yeah,

1257
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:30,810
sure.

1258
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:32,430
John C Dvorak: Why wouldn't you?
That's what you do. That's what

1259
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:35,490
you're supposed to do. That's
what happens when he pledged to

1260
01:14:35,490 --> 01:14:36,150
testify. And

1261
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:38,550
Adam Curry: once you have a plea
deal, that's it. They can't

1262
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:41,040
renege on that. I don't think
yeah, they can unless you're

1263
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:41,610
Hunter Biden.

1264
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:45,390
John C Dvorak: No, they can they
can Oh, there's a lot of

1265
01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:47,790
different ways you don't watch
enough criminals TV shows. I

1266
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:48,360
don't

1267
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:50,760
Adam Curry: don't Sorry. No
good.

1268
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:55,320
John C Dvorak: Yeah, they can
renege. But they won't. They

1269
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,660
don't have time for it because
it's costing them money too.

1270
01:14:57,690 --> 01:15:01,320
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they just You
know, make it sound like she's

1271
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:05,280
got some the goods, she has the
goods gonna come clean and turn

1272
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,190
and turn in trunk beds because
he was obviously wringing his

1273
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:11,520
hands going, here's what we're
going to do, ladies. I don't

1274
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,030
think so.

1275
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:19,560
Adam Curry: That was good. I
love that. Let's see, of course,

1276
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:23,160
we had on the last show day we
had President Biden doing his

1277
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:26,280
primetime message. What did you
think his jacked up factor was?

1278
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:29,370
John C Dvorak: I gave him a five
it was low. I

1279
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:31,950
Adam Curry: agree. I was
expecting more jaggedness. But

1280
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:35,070
around four minutes, he started
to stutter and he was coughing.

1281
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:38,310
John C Dvorak: Oh, they didn't
keep him on long. Was very don't

1282
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:42,060
get enough juice. They don't
leave money they have to if they

1283
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:47,820
give him a good hotshot just
below enough to kill him. He'll

1284
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:50,340
go even on our good hotshot.

1285
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:51,360
Yeah.

1286
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:54,120
Unknown: All right. Here's ABC
News reports night, for the

1287
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:58,620
first time the US has taken
military action in this war to

1288
01:15:58,620 --> 01:15:59,220
defend

1289
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:01,290
Adam Curry: I'm sorry, that's
not the right one. That's not

1290
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:05,070
the right one. Here is CBS.
That's what I'm

1291
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:07,290
Unknown: we're going to begin
with a very forceful message

1292
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:10,290
from President Biden last night.
Did you see it? He's urging the

1293
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:13,830
American people to rally around
Israel and Ukraine. The

1294
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:16,800
President made his case last
night in a rare primetime

1295
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,950
address from the Oval Office.
You're rare? No kidding. He

1296
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:23,880
argued that the US should not
should not let partisan politics

1297
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,550
get in the way of billions of
dollars of new aid to those

1298
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:29,160
countries. A clear message to
Congress

1299
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:32,250
the president speech comes as
the US faces criticism in the

1300
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:35,040
Arab world for supporting
Israel, and its controversial

1301
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:38,580
bombing campaign in Gaza, with
the possible ground invasion

1302
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:41,220
looming. For more on this
critical moment in global

1303
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:43,440
politics. Let's bring in ED
O'KEEFE who is at the White

1304
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,670
House, Edie? Good morning.

1305
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:47,190
Nate, good to see you for the
first time last night the

1306
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:49,800
President tied together the
conflict in Ukraine and the

1307
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,400
conflict in the Middle East.
Alright, stay us engagement,

1308
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:54,660
John C Dvorak: how many times
you're getting it could mean

1309
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,360
you're gonna pass off the story.

1310
01:16:58,290 --> 01:16:59,520
Adam Curry: What do you mean,
pass it off?

1311
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:02,130
John C Dvorak: That one guy
comes on and he passes off to

1312
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:04,620
number two and number two passes
off to number three? Do they

1313
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,720
ever tell us the story? Yes.

1314
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:09,570
Unknown: Let me share with you
why making sure Israel and

1315
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:12,990
Ukraine succeed is vital for
America's national security.

1316
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:15,900
President Biden in a rare Oval
Office primetime

1317
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:19,320
Adam Curry: address how many
times that's a rare, so rare, so

1318
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:22,590
rare, very rare. It's very rare,
very rare, very rare,

1319
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:25,170
Unknown: laid out the stakes for
Americans and he has some

1320
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:29,760
convincing to do rare steaks. As
new CBS polling finds more than

1321
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,180
half of Americans disapprove of
how the president's handling the

1322
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:37,410
Israel Hamas conflict. And
notably, a third of Democrats

1323
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:40,530
disapprove, which creates a
challenge as he prepares to ask

1324
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:43,440
to spend billions more to defend
Israel.

1325
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,330
Adam Curry: That's a third of
Democrats there. They're the

1326
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:48,810
mind controls. But that is your
30% of mind control people and

1327
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:49,350
Ukraine.

1328
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:52,590
Unknown: Hamas and Putin
represent different threats. But

1329
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:55,770
they share this in common. They
both want to completely

1330
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:57,660
annihilate in neighboring
democracy.

1331
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:02,010
And well, Russia's invasion of
Ukraine stretches into nearly

1332
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:05,580
its 20th month, the President
gave some of his most expansive

1333
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:09,060
comments yet justifying
continued US support.

1334
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:12,540
If we walk away and let Putin a
race for Ukraine's independence,

1335
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,840
would be aggressors around the
world be emboldened to try the

1336
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:16,380
same

1337
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:20,130
Mr. Biden is set to ask Congress
today for roughly $100 billion

1338
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,910
in emergency spending over the
next year. It includes $60

1339
01:18:23,910 --> 01:18:28,170
billion to support Ukraine,
around $14 billion for Israel

1340
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:32,100
and a $5 million VIG and the
rest would support Indo Pacific

1341
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:35,280
countries including Taiwan
against Chinese aggression, plus

1342
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,060
billions more US border security
and disaster relief

1343
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:41,880
is a smart investment that's
going to pay dividends for

1344
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,800
American security for
generations.

1345
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:47,040
To Smith comes as overall
Americans strongly support

1346
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:50,220
sending humanitarian aid to
Israelis and Palestinians, and

1347
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:53,160
then using diplomacy to try to
end the conflict.

1348
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:56,370
By caution the Government of
Israel not to be blinded by

1349
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:57,090
rage.

1350
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:03,330
Adam Curry: The President I love
the editing jobs here

1351
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:06,000
Unknown: at Tyrion aid to
Israelis and Palestinians and

1352
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,200
then using diplomacy to try to
end the conflict by COVID

1353
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:10,500
John C Dvorak: Government

1354
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,900
Unknown: of Israel not to be
blinded by rage.

1355
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:17,070
The President also denounced
attacks on innocent Palestinians

1356
01:19:17,070 --> 01:19:20,190
abroad and he went home
recalling the brutal murder this

1357
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:23,280
week of a six year old Muslim
boy from the Chicago there it is

1358
01:19:23,310 --> 01:19:26,190
efficiency a Palestinian
American was stabbed to death by

1359
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:29,010
his family's landlord and I hate
crime attack.

1360
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:32,550
And all you heard it because
you're you're hurting. I want

1361
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:36,720
you to know I see you. You
belong. And I want to say this

1362
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:40,320
to you. You're all America. He's
talking to the base

1363
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:44,370
and he reiterated dual global
conflicts are a direct threat,

1364
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:46,260
even worlds away.

1365
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,230
American leadership is what
holds the world together.

1366
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:52,680
American alliances are what keep
us America safe.

1367
01:19:52,710 --> 01:19:54,150
Adam Curry: Yeah, real safe.

1368
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:59,970
John C Dvorak: There's no I have
I have dead date shoptech Today

1369
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:06,150
Have a 13 second continuous
Biden from speech. And I brought

1370
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:08,730
here odd comment. And there's
something about the wind when

1371
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:11,850
you piece it together listening
to it this way, it's got an odd

1372
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:12,840
moment,

1373
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:15,240
Unknown: I'm going to send to
Congress, an urgent budget

1374
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,540
request to fund America's
national security needs to

1375
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:22,650
support our critical partners,
including Israel and Ukraine is

1376
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:25,200
a smart investment that's going
to pay dividends for American

1377
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,120
security for generations. It's
going to

1378
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,080
Adam Curry: pay dividends.

1379
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:30,150
John C Dvorak: How's it going to
pay dividends?

1380
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:32,280
Adam Curry: Well, it's going to
pay dividends perfectly.

1381
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:36,360
Everyone who invest in the
Ukraine rebuilding project is

1382
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:36,960
going to have it

1383
01:20:38,190 --> 01:20:39,720
John C Dvorak: doesn't mean that
we're going to get all that

1384
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:40,290
business.

1385
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:45,989
Adam Curry: What a president
lying. No, of course not. But we

1386
01:20:45,989 --> 01:20:49,889
know that the consultant said
you got to get in now get out on

1387
01:20:49,889 --> 01:20:52,949
the ground on the ground floor
because the money's coming. The

1388
01:20:52,949 --> 01:20:56,429
60 billion, this is what it's
for. And there's a 5 billion

1389
01:20:56,429 --> 01:20:59,819
vague in there somewhere that I
think goes to James Biden, this

1390
01:20:59,819 --> 01:21:05,549
is also corrupt. I thought that
Israel Hamas was the this was

1391
01:21:05,549 --> 01:21:07,829
the big one. This is the big
war. This is what we really used

1392
01:21:07,829 --> 01:21:14,819
to be afraid of. But no most of
the money goes to Ukraine. Don't

1393
01:21:14,849 --> 01:21:18,749
I don't get it anymore. Now now,
of course, the President's

1394
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:27,929
speech did not did not do the
right thing at all. And Bolton

1395
01:21:27,929 --> 01:21:30,539
came out. The mustache fart
sniffer.

1396
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:33,270
Unknown: The principal threat to
peace and security in the Middle

1397
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:37,590
East today and for some years
back has been Iran. In the

1398
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:41,040
current circumstance. They're
the ones who have armed and

1399
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,100
trained and equipped and
financed Hamas. They've done the

1400
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:47,190
same with Palestinian Islamic
Jihad. They've done the same

1401
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:50,490
with Hezbollah. They've done the
same with the Syrian military.

1402
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,460
And remember just yesterday,
demonstrating again, they've

1403
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:57,690
done it with the Houthi rebels
in Yemen. a US destroyer in the

1404
01:21:57,690 --> 01:22:01,200
Red Sea destroyed several cruise
missiles and I think some drones

1405
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:05,190
heading north in the Red Sea
probably toward Israel. So the

1406
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:08,130
hoodies wouldn't have any rocks
to rub together. If it weren't

1407
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:11,160
for the equipment. Iran has
given them Iran as the central

1408
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:14,700
factor here. and last night the
president's address which was

1409
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:18,390
fine as far as it went, did not
address that crucial point. How

1410
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:21,690
can you have a strategy if you
don't know what the main threat

1411
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:22,560
is? In fact,

1412
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,200
I would say bomb bomb bomb
again.

1413
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:28,410
Adam Curry: Yes, this is he's
talking about the Hootie, Hootie

1414
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:31,770
and the Blowfish. I don't know.
It's who fees you mustache jerk.

1415
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:31,890
The

1416
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:36,060
Unknown: real question is do you
want to deal with the threat

1417
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:39,240
from Iran? Or do you want to
pretend that it doesn't exist?

1418
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:43,290
The administration has gone out
of its way right. Pretend that

1419
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:47,010
it doesn't exist, including its
chief Iran negotiator, Rob

1420
01:22:47,010 --> 01:22:51,450
Malley being having his security
clearance suspended in April by

1421
01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:54,630
the State Department's
Diplomatic Security Bureau that

1422
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:57,990
the chief negotiator under
security investigation. It's

1423
01:22:57,990 --> 01:22:59,190
just unbelievable.

1424
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:02,250
Somebody's got to drop a new
tear. I don't know who it is,

1425
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:03,540
but I don't want to watch

1426
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:09,060
Adam Curry: Yes, this is how we
draw Iran into the conflict is

1427
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:12,840
with it's crazy. The hoodies
hoodies in the blowfish up

1428
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:15,810
there. They got drones. They got
cruise missiles. I mean, there's

1429
01:23:15,810 --> 01:23:17,010
got to be Iran right

1430
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,970
Unknown: tonight. For the first
time the US has taken military

1431
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:23,820
action in this war to defend
Israel.

1432
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:27,690
Adam Curry: Yeah,

1433
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:30,780
Unknown: with the hoody see us
has Kearney a guided missile

1434
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:34,530
destroyer in the northern Red
Sea shooting down three land

1435
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:37,920
attack cruise missiles and
several drones. They say were

1436
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:42,750
launched from Yemen, possibly
towards Israel by Iran passively

1437
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:43,470
forces

1438
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:46,170
Adam Curry: this is just this is
ABC, of course Martha Raddatz.

1439
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:51,180
These people are war mongers.
They are paid off and completely

1440
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:54,180
under control by the military
industrial complex.

1441
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:58,530
John C Dvorak: They have the
idea, by the way, that from

1442
01:23:58,530 --> 01:24:02,940
Yemen, where they're having the
time of their lives, you know,

1443
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:07,230
fighting against the Saudis.
They're going to waste a missile

1444
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:11,130
and shit and send it toward it
for some reason what with with

1445
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:14,610
our defenses right there.
They're going to send it to her

1446
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:18,180
toward Israel just randomly. It
doesn't make any sense.

1447
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:20,790
Unknown: We cannot say for
certain what these missiles and

1448
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:23,790
drones were targeting, but they
were launched from Yemen heading

1449
01:24:23,790 --> 01:24:26,880
north along the Red Sea,
potentially towards targets in

1450
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:27,360
Israel.

1451
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:31,290
John C Dvorak: I get potentially
we're not sure surely maybe we

1452
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:32,040
can be sure.

1453
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:36,150
Unknown: People believe and it's
likely true. The US is

1454
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:40,080
bolstering its firepower in the
region, a second carrier strike

1455
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:44,310
group joining us warships
already in the Mediterranean and

1456
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:48,480
additional fighter aircraft also
being sent all meant as a

1457
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,350
deterrent.

1458
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:54,000
We aim to send a strong message
intended to deter a wider

1459
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,840
conflict to bolster regional
stability and of course to make

1460
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,660
it clear that we will protect
and defend our national security

1461
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:01,320
interests

1462
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:06,000
and tonight real concern for US
forces in the region with

1463
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:11,220
attacks against US bases in Iraq
and Syria in the past 24 hours.

1464
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:16,230
And another today. One drone
shot down. No injuries reported.

1465
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:21,510
Tractor sheltering in place in
Iraq died of cardiac arrest.

1466
01:25:22,229 --> 01:25:26,879
John C Dvorak: Ah, some guided
heart attack. Yeah. Contractor.

1467
01:25:26,909 --> 01:25:29,579
Yep. Hey, buddy. If you don't
like it in the Middle East get

1468
01:25:29,579 --> 01:25:35,759
out do Yeah. Well, I got most of
my clips from Al Jazeera because

1469
01:25:35,759 --> 01:25:38,339
they seem to be trying to be
objective.

1470
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,910
Adam Curry: Okay, well, you know
what Ron? Ron DeSantis says, I

1471
01:25:44,910 --> 01:25:47,070
wouldn't trust anything from Al
Jazeera.

1472
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:51,870
John C Dvorak: Yeah, well, he. I
don't know where you can't get

1473
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:55,740
reasonable coverage from anybody
but Al Jazeera and I hate to say

1474
01:25:55,740 --> 01:26:01,800
that, but let's start with the
Gaza convoy, which has been a

1475
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:08,490
fiasco report. From Al Jazeera.
This is war Gaza convoy report

1476
01:26:08,549 --> 01:26:11,099
Unknown: as more convoy of 20
trucks carrying food and

1477
01:26:11,099 --> 01:26:14,039
medicine have entered Gaza
through the Rapha crossing from

1478
01:26:14,069 --> 01:26:17,669
Egypt and unloading their
desperately needed cargo. But

1479
01:26:17,669 --> 01:26:20,729
rights groups say the aid won't
even make a dent in terms of

1480
01:26:20,729 --> 01:26:24,509
relief for the 2.3 million
Palestinians. As Harry Fawcett

1481
01:26:24,509 --> 01:26:25,289
reports.

1482
01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:29,640
They'd been standing ready for
days and at last the first

1483
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:32,670
lorries carrying desperately
needed supplies or on the move

1484
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:36,690
from Egypt into Gaza, just 20 of
them what aid agencies are

1485
01:26:36,690 --> 01:26:40,620
calling a drop in the ocean,
when a sustained reliable supply

1486
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:43,110
is what causes people require a
well I

1487
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:46,230
can not have that amount and we
hope this is the beginning and

1488
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:49,200
that's efficient aid will arrive
sad and there would be global

1489
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,570
pressure to stop the aggression
on Gaza,

1490
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:55,650
food, water and medicine. We're
all unloaded that new fuel part

1491
01:26:55,650 --> 01:26:58,230
of Israeli conditions barring
anything it says could aid

1492
01:26:58,230 --> 01:27:03,540
Hamas. And the border was closed
again immediately. No way out

1493
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:05,910
for those with foreign
passports, who had been told to

1494
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:08,670
gather there, among them. The
mother in law of Scotland's

1495
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:10,440
First Minister Hamza Yusuf

1496
01:27:10,650 --> 01:27:14,160
people of Gaza want to live they
can in the know you even believe

1497
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:18,330
there's no air they suffered,
watch the children play in the

1498
01:27:18,330 --> 01:27:21,900
day and cry in the evening. My
heart is broken.

1499
01:27:23,790 --> 01:27:26,010
Adam Curry: But at least Algeria
is learning how to use that

1500
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:28,140
trauma based entertainment that
the meal

1501
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:31,620
John C Dvorak: what is what are
these weird people doing in

1502
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:36,030
Gaza? Like that woman that Irish
woman who's the mother or

1503
01:27:36,030 --> 01:27:41,580
daughter or sister of some Irish
you know, diplomat, I guess

1504
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:45,210
we've noticed this and they let
you know they let the two

1505
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,580
American hostages go you know,

1506
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:50,040
Adam Curry: you know do you have
any any clips on that because

1507
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,320
that whole thing smells very
fishy

1508
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:55,320
John C Dvorak: I only have a
couple of congressmen and I have

1509
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:59,220
a I was looking I there was a
clip I want to get I don't have

1510
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:03,570
it but there is that thing
stinks Yeah Right yeah. And in

1511
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:08,730
fact what that does these clips
here this to two more hostages

1512
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:13,800
tale is worth playing because
they've decided they're going to

1513
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,590
release a couple more and they
just really say we don't want

1514
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:20,910
them using this for propaganda
and so they so LG zero brings on

1515
01:28:20,910 --> 01:28:24,540
a complainer who's a Hamas guy
going out? Yeah, these guys.

1516
01:28:24,810 --> 01:28:27,630
They won't do anything. We try
to help them and we're, you

1517
01:28:27,630 --> 01:28:30,240
know, we're getting no, just
play this

1518
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:33,810
Unknown: in Gaza and the
military wing of Hamas says

1519
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:37,170
Israel has refused to accept its
offer to release to more

1520
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:40,260
captives. Ghassan brigades says
it wanted to release the

1521
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:43,920
captives on humanitarian grounds
and without conditions. The

1522
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,740
Israeli Prime Minister's Office
has responded saying that they

1523
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:50,610
will not address quote false
Hamas propaganda and will

1524
01:28:50,610 --> 01:28:54,000
continue to work to bring all
captives and those missing back

1525
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,420
home. Earlier my colleague
Felipe attivo, spoke to Hamas

1526
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:01,200
spokesman coloured Allah
Khademi. He says there were no

1527
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,440
clear reasons for Israel to
reject that proposal,

1528
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:10,500
or they were to captives with
the custom brigade and due to

1529
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:17,160
severe humanitarian position. We
decided to hand them over to the

1530
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:21,060
families through the brothers in
Qatar, and that's what we have

1531
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:22,950
informed them last night

1532
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:25,320
Adam Curry: were these hostages
in Qatar.

1533
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:28,920
John C Dvorak: No, I don't think
so. They're gonna get into

1534
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:33,000
Qatar. And this whole redist
report just emphasizes what's

1535
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,570
wrong with the first dose to
those first two, that girl and

1536
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:43,200
her mom who were praised as as
supporters of BLM and part of

1537
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:43,740
the movement.

1538
01:29:44,610 --> 01:29:48,660
Adam Curry: This reads like a
UFC script. The whole thing,

1539
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:50,340
doesn't it?

1540
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:54,240
John C Dvorak: Yeah, it does.
It's really, really lame. And

1541
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,220
when you listen to this guy
going on,

1542
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:57,930
Adam Curry: I want to roll it
back again. I want to hear

1543
01:29:57,930 --> 01:29:59,670
exactly what he said. What am I
want

1544
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:01,620
John C Dvorak: to mention Even
if you're going to religious

1545
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:04,110
release some you don't have to
what is this real got to do with

1546
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:05,430
it just let them go

1547
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:09,720
Unknown: and humanitarian
position. We decided to hand

1548
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:10,890
them over to the Who

1549
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:12,840
Adam Curry: is this guy who's
this guy talking?

1550
01:30:13,290 --> 01:30:17,490
John C Dvorak: This is the Hamas
spokesperson, okay. This is the

1551
01:30:17,490 --> 01:30:18,330
Baghdad,

1552
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:22,440
Adam Curry: backed Baghdad Bob.
I forgot about him.

1553
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:27,270
Unknown: And they were two
captives with the custom brigade

1554
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:34,230
and due to severe humanitarian
position, we decided to hand

1555
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:37,590
them over to their families,
through the brothers in Qatar,

1556
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:42,780
and that what we have informed
them last night without anything

1557
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:49,110
in return. But unfortunately,
the government of Israel, they

1558
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:54,960
refuse to take them. And that is
also proof our ideas that this

1559
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:59,790
this occupation, this Israeli
government is not serious and is

1560
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:08,010
not ready to stop this blood
sitting. Continuous situation.

1561
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:11,820
Did the Israelis tell the
catteries we're negotiating

1562
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:15,870
these releases? They tell them
why they refuse to take these

1563
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:16,680
two captives.

1564
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:20,580
We didn't receive anything on
that. Wait a minute.

1565
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:27,870
Adam Curry: So our best friend
in the region refuses to take

1566
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:30,000
hostages who are Americans?

1567
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,730
John C Dvorak: No, these are no
these weren't Americans are just

1568
01:31:32,730 --> 01:31:33,750
a call randos

1569
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:36,780
Adam Curry: Oh, randos. Okay,
it's just randos. Well, who

1570
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:38,070
cares about the randos?

1571
01:31:39,330 --> 01:31:41,280
John C Dvorak: Well, I don't
even believe any of this story.

1572
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:44,820
The whole thing seems fishy.
Yeah. And Israel thinks is

1573
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:47,580
bogus. And so they just don't
want to deal with it. Why don't

1574
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:49,860
you just give them to the Qatar
Qatar ease? I mean, there's

1575
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:52,860
other things you can do with
them. But okay, let's play part

1576
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:53,310
two.

1577
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:56,340
Unknown: Okay. You say they were
released, you wanted to release

1578
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:59,400
them because of severe
humanitarian conditions, what

1579
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,010
conditions besides you? Were
they injured were they

1580
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:07,740
nothing, there's nothing I can
share with friends over here.

1581
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:12,300
More than what has been come
with the statements of our VEDA

1582
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:18,930
that those two captives they
were in the custody of Alka sand

1583
01:32:18,930 --> 01:32:22,650
brigade. And due to their
position to the humanitarian

1584
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:31,830
position, we decided to hand
them over to refute the lies of

1585
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:36,660
the Israeli governments about
our fighters and their high

1586
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:40,650
morals and high values, that
they respect the prisoners and

1587
01:32:40,650 --> 01:32:45,840
the captives. And they deal them
as guests. They will live as our

1588
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:50,550
other people live in in Gaza.
But again, I mean, the Israeli

1589
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:53,340
government, they are not
serious. Previously, we have

1590
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:56,460
announced that we are having
four prisoners before this war.

1591
01:32:56,730 --> 01:33:00,390
And the Netanyahu government
refused to talk anything about

1592
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:04,200
the swab and they're exchanging
the prisoners and today, we are

1593
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:09,540
having hundreds of them still,
we are we have offered to hand

1594
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:14,610
over those captives who are in
severe humanitarian condition

1595
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:20,100
for a sole reason of
humanitarian reasons that we

1596
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:23,220
wanted to return them to their
families but the government's

1597
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:26,400
they are not serious on that
they want to continue killing

1598
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:30,000
our children. They want to
continue bombardment, the houses

1599
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,380
the the Safe Families in their
homes, and they live bombardment

1600
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:39,630
of mosques, hospitals, churches,
and they want to continue all

1601
01:33:39,630 --> 01:33:42,780
over like that. And
unfortunately, it looks that the

1602
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,110
the the American government is
supporting their position. And

1603
01:33:46,889 --> 01:33:49,319
if I can just interrupt you for
a second just to get a bit more

1604
01:33:50,039 --> 01:33:54,059
from you on this. You see, Hamas
al Qassam brigades were prepared

1605
01:33:54,059 --> 01:33:58,919
to release those captors, with
severe humanitarian conditions

1606
01:33:59,129 --> 01:34:02,609
and pass on brigades have said
they want to do this free of

1607
01:34:02,759 --> 01:34:04,949
charge with nothing in exchange.

1608
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:09,030
Adam Curry: This is weird. The
guy won't explain what the

1609
01:34:09,030 --> 01:34:12,690
extreme actions are as a
strategist.

1610
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:15,240
John C Dvorak: By the way, this
one's kind of like Al Jazeera

1611
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:18,180
during this reporting. They
actually have reporters in

1612
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:22,260
Israel all over the place and in
Gaza all over the place. And

1613
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:24,750
they're giving us material
that's kind of funny. Do they

1614
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:25,800
have this? Do they have

1615
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,590
Adam Curry: flak jackets on with
media? No.

1616
01:34:29,550 --> 01:34:32,220
John C Dvorak: This one says to
more second round and he brought

1617
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:38,400
somebody else in to talk more
BS. And this is continues this

1618
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:41,790
analysis or non analysis or
whatever you want to call it. I

1619
01:34:41,790 --> 01:34:43,260
just found it kind of
interesting.

1620
01:34:44,010 --> 01:34:46,710
Unknown: How is this playing out
on the ground with the public in

1621
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:47,280
Israel?

1622
01:34:47,610 --> 01:34:50,670
So Emily, this is interesting,
because we saw something

1623
01:34:50,670 --> 01:34:54,450
relatively new happening. We'll
compare it to what's been going

1624
01:34:54,450 --> 01:34:58,080
on the past few weeks. Saturday
evening, you had a protest

1625
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:01,710
hundreds of people in Tel Aviv
good Gathering in front of the

1626
01:35:01,710 --> 01:35:05,550
Ministry of Defense, many of
them were relatives of those who

1627
01:35:05,550 --> 01:35:09,600
are being held captive by Hamas
inside of Gaza. And there was a

1628
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,120
level of anger being
demonstrated to the government

1629
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:15,720
here that we've not yet really
seen, up until this point, many

1630
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:18,240
of these relatives essentially
saying that the Israeli

1631
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:21,420
government is not doing enough
to ensure the release of these

1632
01:35:21,510 --> 01:35:23,640
of these captives that they
would like to see the government

1633
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:25,980
do more that they would like the
government to implement a

1634
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:29,880
ceasefire until the captives are
released. And in fact, they were

1635
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:32,910
also calling on the
international community to step

1636
01:35:32,910 --> 01:35:36,690
in, and help more to ensure that
these captives can be freed.

1637
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:40,110
Now, beyond that, we're also
hearing more about public what

1638
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:41,640
with the international

1639
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:42,480
Adam Curry: community.

1640
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:46,290
John C Dvorak: They find that
peculiar this whole report now

1641
01:35:46,290 --> 01:35:48,930
this report, we don't have any
of this from Western media with

1642
01:35:48,930 --> 01:35:52,740
the protests in Tel Aviv. No,
well, then he brings in some

1643
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:54,900
polling that was done in there.

1644
01:35:56,010 --> 01:35:57,540
Adam Curry: We finished the
clip, I want to hear the rest of

1645
01:35:57,540 --> 01:36:00,330
the clip. I'm just I just stop
it just like, What's he talking

1646
01:36:00,330 --> 01:36:00,750
about? It's

1647
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:03,150
Unknown: our release. And in
fact, they were also calling on

1648
01:36:03,150 --> 01:36:06,810
the international community to
step in, and help more to ensure

1649
01:36:06,870 --> 01:36:10,140
that these captives can be
freed. Now, beyond that, it

1650
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:12,480
Adam Curry: sounds like a play.
This is some kind of, you know,

1651
01:36:12,510 --> 01:36:16,050
some play like, hey, you know,
look, it's they're trying to do

1652
01:36:16,050 --> 01:36:17,940
PR, but they're talking to the
wrong

1653
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:21,000
Unknown: media outfits are also
hearing more about public

1654
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,990
opinion, public opinion,
different aspects of the war

1655
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:30,660
right now, in Israel. So we've
heard from a polling institute

1656
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:34,200
called, we're polling the war
now, Gump. And they released a

1657
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:38,910
survey that found, among other
things, first, that around 57%

1658
01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:43,410
of Israelis support a plan to
exchange families held by Hamas,

1659
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:47,400
with Palestinian children held
in Israeli jails survey also

1660
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:47,730
weighed.

1661
01:36:49,650 --> 01:36:51,690
Adam Curry: These Israelis have
children in jails,

1662
01:36:53,310 --> 01:36:56,130
John C Dvorak: at seams, so if
you want to stop that clip, and

1663
01:36:56,130 --> 01:37:02,190
play this crazy screed of stats
that this American Palestinian

1664
01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:06,390
woman had on again off of Al
Jazeera, and I think, let me see

1665
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:10,440
if I can find that. It's too
many clips,

1666
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:13,530
Adam Curry: craziest read of
stats, this

1667
01:37:13,530 --> 01:37:15,870
John C Dvorak: is great. This
woman is being grilled one way

1668
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:19,890
that she's going back and forth
with this interview. And she

1669
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:26,370
just goes off on the, on the
interviewer on Al Jazeera. And

1670
01:37:26,370 --> 01:37:30,000
she has a screen of like, just
stat. I

1671
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,350
Adam Curry: got it here. I got
it here. Okay,

1672
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:32,460
John C Dvorak: play this

1673
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:36,810
Unknown: Israel right now, let's
not forget, there are 5500

1674
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:40,710
Palestinians in Israeli jails,
with 1300, of whom

1675
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:43,980
administrative detention held
without charges without evidence

1676
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:47,970
without trial. Since 1967,
Israel has imprisoned over a

1677
01:37:47,970 --> 01:37:52,410
million Palestinians. So when we
talk about numbers when we want

1678
01:37:52,410 --> 01:37:54,570
to talk about civilians being
captured when we talk about

1679
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:58,500
civilians being killed, okay,
there's over a million

1680
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,750
Palestinians who have been in
Israeli military prison since

1681
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:06,360
1967. And 80,000, Palestinians
killed since 19. Sorry, 67. So,

1682
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:11,280
I mean, yes, we can, we are
opposed to civilians being used

1683
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:15,090
in any way and being killed. But
let's keep things in perspective

1684
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:18,210
here. And let's look at the
larger picture and who is really

1685
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:22,770
putting the people, innocent
civilians captive for decades,

1686
01:38:22,770 --> 01:38:26,760
including now we're seeing it in
Gaza. But they've done this

1687
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:29,040
collective punishment against
Palestinian people in the West

1688
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:32,160
Bank and Gaza for decades,
including shutting off water and

1689
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:36,720
destroying water lines to
Palestinian cities, including

1690
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:41,340
building a apartheid wall,
including implementing ways, you

1691
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:44,340
know, cutting off cities from
one another, including

1692
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:48,150
imprisoning children in Israeli
military prisons, without their

1693
01:38:48,150 --> 01:38:51,570
parents or legal representation.
So I mean, context is extremely

1694
01:38:51,570 --> 01:38:54,750
important. Let's not forget who
the king of propaganda is in

1695
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:55,530
this situation.

1696
01:38:55,740 --> 01:38:58,890
Okay. We appreciate your passion
on these issues. Dana, worry,

1697
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:01,560
Hutchinson, a Palestinian
American rights activist, thanks

1698
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:02,070
for your time.

1699
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:05,190
Adam Curry: Thank you. Well,
well now.

1700
01:39:05,730 --> 01:39:08,340
John C Dvorak: So they had some
kid they have kids, I guess. But

1701
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:12,900
what did that mean? 17 year
olds, 16 year olds. Five, you're

1702
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:13,500
also could

1703
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:17,040
Adam Curry: have just meant, you
know, behind the wall in Gaza,

1704
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,600
you can say well, you know, lots
of people say

1705
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:21,540
John C Dvorak: like, same same
coming over that you want to

1706
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:23,190
finish this. I do want to

1707
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:26,040
Unknown: finish us with
Palestinian children held in

1708
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:30,240
Israeli jails survey also found
that around 57% of Israelis

1709
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:33,210
support a plan to create
humanitarian corridors for

1710
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:37,380
children in Gaza, managed by the
UN. And furthermore, it found

1711
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:41,220
that 54% of Israeli say
compliance with international

1712
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:44,970
humanitarian law isn't
necessary, including precautions

1713
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:48,870
to minimize harm to children
when at war with Hamas. Now if I

1714
01:39:48,870 --> 01:39:53,640
can just unpack that last D.
This is quite remarkable,

1715
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:57,330
because this is saying that
there's a majority of Israelis

1716
01:39:57,330 --> 01:40:01,680
54% According to this survey, so
They're saying that compliance

1717
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:06,210
with international humanitarian
law is not necessary, including

1718
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:10,770
when it pertains to minimizing
harm to children when it applies

1719
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,000
to war with Hamas.

1720
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:14,160
Adam Curry: I did get some
feedback from one of our

1721
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:19,710
producers about the term unpack
and its origin. And the thinking

1722
01:40:19,710 --> 01:40:26,760
is that it comes from Peggy
McIntosh, a 1989 essay about

1723
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:30,600
white privilege, titled white
privilege unpacking the

1724
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:36,360
invisible knapsack that could be
the origin of this

1725
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:40,680
John C Dvorak: funny bit in the
back unpack Well, I want to

1726
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:44,160
point out something in that
guy's going on and on with his

1727
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:49,170
numbers. He elegir Zero has been
doing a pro a bunch of

1728
01:40:49,170 --> 01:40:54,210
programming on the bloodthirsty
Nate that last little thing he

1729
01:40:54,210 --> 01:40:57,330
having just play a little bit of
d&d 50 fall I just say what it

1730
01:40:57,330 --> 01:41:04,890
is. 54% of Israelis polled don't
give a shit about war crimes. So

1731
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:07,140
Adam Curry: what is this
polling? It was at a call out?

1732
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:12,810
Did they have people on the
internet poll?

1733
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:15,000
John C Dvorak: No, there was
some company mentioned that you

1734
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:15,660
mentioned to her

1735
01:41:15,660 --> 01:41:18,690
Adam Curry: but I understand
there's a company they did go

1736
01:41:18,690 --> 01:41:20,550
John C Dvorak: details of
polling. People just say

1737
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:24,330
polling, it's sick. They're
polling the war. But the thing

1738
01:41:24,330 --> 01:41:28,860
is, is that Al Jazeera has been
promoting the idea of Israelis

1739
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:34,560
as bloodthirsty demons and I
will rise anti semitic and I

1740
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:38,790
have to go into well, it's Al
Jazeera. And I have to they did

1741
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:41,100
their special report I don't
have any clips from it, but it's

1742
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:44,880
fascinating. They clipped a
bunch of the what I would call

1743
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:48,600
Israeli Hicks people living in
the you know out in the middle

1744
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:51,930
of nowhere someplace in the
hills. You know, it's the same

1745
01:41:51,930 --> 01:41:54,780
kind of thing that we do in our
meeting where we try to get some

1746
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:58,290
guy talks like this he's got a
mission to some front and I'm

1747
01:41:58,290 --> 01:42:01,440
sorry I'm talking to foreign
correct cat dog. Oh, my dude

1748
01:42:01,470 --> 01:42:02,850
mitten. No, no, no,

1749
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,220
Adam Curry: no no this this is
the guy this is the guy

1750
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:13,050
John C Dvorak: these guys got so
they have these fans and the way

1751
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:16,440
they presented it was very good
and so far as propaganda is

1752
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:20,190
concerned they they have these
literally beautiful Israeli

1753
01:42:20,190 --> 01:42:27,660
girls who are Hicks. Oh, loud in
the the only good Arabs a dead

1754
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:31,050
Arab I don't care if we shoot
every Arab if they come to the

1755
01:42:31,050 --> 01:42:35,790
house, and we shoot them it's
okay. She goes on and on like

1756
01:42:35,790 --> 01:42:39,540
this. Then they bring on another
beautiful girl and she's just

1757
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:45,240
bloodthirsty and so so the Algis
are is kind of doing this kind

1758
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:48,150
of thing. And I'm watching this
going wow, this is really good

1759
01:42:48,150 --> 01:42:49,560
stuff. But let's

1760
01:42:51,090 --> 01:42:52,230
Adam Curry: kind of Google are
you

1761
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:56,100
John C Dvorak: deconstructing
your I think it's fascinating.

1762
01:42:57,030 --> 01:43:00,900
So here's this two more round
second round two

1763
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,660
Unknown: and this is really
reflective of the mood right now

1764
01:43:03,690 --> 01:43:07,500
in Israel because you have so
much anger and shock still at

1765
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:12,240
what happened on October 7 When
that Hamas attack occurred and

1766
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:17,130
there is so much anger driving
all of this you have poll after

1767
01:43:17,130 --> 01:43:20,400
poll in Israel in which people
are saying predominantly that

1768
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:24,870
they want the Israeli government
to go in and destroy Hamas Emily

1769
01:43:25,620 --> 01:43:30,240
Adam Curry: you know it's times
like this when the media has

1770
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:35,190
just lost lost their their
marbles and all they want and

1771
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:38,910
all media around the world they
just want blood they want

1772
01:43:38,910 --> 01:43:42,930
explosions, they want strife
they want disagreement the bank

1773
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:47,070
they want is money in the bank.
And I think the curry Devorah

1774
01:43:47,070 --> 01:43:54,240
Consulting Group can help people
while making bank ourselves by

1775
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:59,430
resurrecting our game show win
lose orj everybody has time to

1776
01:43:59,430 --> 01:44:03,930
play around win lose. Who's
gonna get it this time? Well the

1777
01:44:03,930 --> 01:44:07,320
hot Israeli lady kills him
Palestinian or the other way

1778
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:11,250
around. Find out tonight. Lose
orj

1779
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:20,130
John C Dvorak: just the thought
Yeah, the problem with our game

1780
01:44:20,130 --> 01:44:22,620
shows all it has is the opening
jingle I always

1781
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:23,460
Adam Curry: have a game show.

1782
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:24,900
John C Dvorak: We do have a real

1783
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:29,940
Adam Curry: game show we have a
stinger that's all we have. We

1784
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:33,690
don't we don't have a format or
a station to broadcast on. But

1785
01:44:33,690 --> 01:44:35,100
the idea is meant

1786
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:42,360
John C Dvorak: it is. There was
another guy that came out a guy

1787
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:46,920
named Daniel Levy. And I have a
clip from him he

1788
01:44:47,550 --> 01:44:50,880
Adam Curry: Oh yes. I played
this Daniel levy guy he was the

1789
01:44:51,180 --> 01:44:55,260
was the former negotiator or
Ambassador

1790
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:57,810
John C Dvorak: yeah he's one of
those guys is in and around in

1791
01:44:57,810 --> 01:44:58,440
and around

1792
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:01,440
Adam Curry: former yes former
Israeli You peace negotiator.

1793
01:45:01,590 --> 01:45:02,250
That's yeah. And

1794
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:05,640
John C Dvorak: he was on with
another one of these interview

1795
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:09,990
shows on AlJazeera called bottom
line and he came on and he was

1796
01:45:09,990 --> 01:45:14,460
on forever, yak, yak, yak yak in
a way. And he did. And he was

1797
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:17,880
saying is this is going to be
bad news for this person is bad

1798
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:20,790
news for Netanyahu had bad news
for this and bad news for that.

1799
01:45:20,970 --> 01:45:24,120
But he came up with a little
like, again, I'll use the word

1800
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:29,280
screed about this being bad news
for the United States because

1801
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:34,260
Biden is a fuckup. And this
whole situation is not good.

1802
01:45:34,530 --> 01:45:40,410
Unknown: America looks like an
outlier, not like a model to be

1803
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:45,420
emulated. But like a country
that is fundamentally getting

1804
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:48,330
his priorities wrong and doesn't
care when there is a boomerang

1805
01:45:48,330 --> 01:45:51,780
effect across much of the rest
of the world. We are seeing an

1806
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:55,830
America that looks like a war
mongering nation. And I worry

1807
01:45:55,860 --> 01:45:58,110
for that I worry for that
reputation.

1808
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:01,170
Adam Curry: What do you mean, we
didn't have that reputation

1809
01:46:01,170 --> 01:46:04,890
already? Isn't that isn't that
our reputation?

1810
01:46:04,950 --> 01:46:07,230
John C Dvorak: I thought that
was always our reputation. We're

1811
01:46:07,230 --> 01:46:09,060
a war mongering nation

1812
01:46:09,090 --> 01:46:11,730
Adam Curry: that I mean, that's
what most people in the rest of

1813
01:46:11,730 --> 01:46:13,290
the world look at us as that's
why

1814
01:46:13,290 --> 01:46:14,700
John C Dvorak: we got to keep
Trump out.

1815
01:46:15,990 --> 01:46:18,330
Adam Curry: Because he'll stop
all the wars. That's no good.

1816
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:22,590
Speaking of that, we got a note
from one of our Jewish

1817
01:46:22,590 --> 01:46:26,730
producers. And I say this
because I don't want to give her

1818
01:46:26,730 --> 01:46:29,010
name way because a little
personal note, but you know,

1819
01:46:29,010 --> 01:46:32,460
she's had some issues in temple
with vaccine stuff back in the

1820
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:37,320
day. And so she's written us
quite openly. And this is just a

1821
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:42,240
lighthearted note. She says, I
hope you're well want to share a

1822
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:45,090
story that happened this week,
when the Israel conflicts began,

1823
01:46:45,090 --> 01:46:48,630
I tuned into Ben Shapiro. Of
course, that's all the Jews

1824
01:46:48,630 --> 01:46:51,780
immediately go to Ben Shapiro,
American Jews, because I

1825
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:54,990
understand why I figured he
would have boots on the ground

1826
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:57,900
reports. I'm not a regular
listener of his anymore, but

1827
01:46:57,930 --> 01:47:00,870
this warranted some attention.
In the middle of one is one of

1828
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:03,600
his reports, he began talking
about President Trump. Now

1829
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:06,030
Shapiro has never been a Trump
supporter, but he admits he will

1830
01:47:06,030 --> 01:47:08,400
vote for him if he's a nominee
in the next election, but he

1831
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:12,420
began to criticize Trump for
Trump's alleged castigation of

1832
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:16,350
Netanyahu when the attacks
began, Shapiro was furious about

1833
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:20,310
how Trump could use the events
to boost his own ego and agenda.

1834
01:47:20,550 --> 01:47:24,270
I just listened. I didn't think
much of it until I heard John's

1835
01:47:24,270 --> 01:47:28,830
deconstruction of Brooks and
Dunn. on Episode 1599, Shapiro

1836
01:47:28,830 --> 01:47:33,330
had used the exact same
decontextualized clip of Trump

1837
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:37,710
that Brooks and K part had used.
I was so flabbergasted the next

1838
01:47:37,710 --> 01:47:41,160
day on the way to school, I
forced my husband and children

1839
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:44,070
to listen to the whole segment.
My kids listen, I knew anyway,

1840
01:47:44,070 --> 01:47:47,490
but the husband doesn't. At the
end of the deconstruction my

1841
01:47:47,490 --> 01:47:51,210
husband turned to me and said, I
think I'm ready to start

1842
01:47:51,210 --> 01:47:55,920
listening to your no agenda,
guys. Now. Another marriage save

1843
01:47:56,370 --> 01:48:03,210
another man. Yes, yes. Yes. So I
didn't

1844
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:05,940
John C Dvorak: know that
Shapiro, you said same misguided

1845
01:48:05,940 --> 01:48:10,230
clipped, chopped up clip.
That's, that's, that's, that's

1846
01:48:10,230 --> 01:48:14,580
bad. That's bad. That's really
bad. My last allergy zero thing

1847
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:19,050
I want to play is that they were
going on and on about, there was

1848
01:48:19,050 --> 01:48:22,500
this long, kind of a
presentation. And they had this

1849
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:25,620
little bit at the end where,
where Biden is out in the lawn

1850
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:28,170
or someplace and somebody says,
What are you going to do what's

1851
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:33,270
going on? Bla bla bla bla bla,
Biden says, I'm talking to

1852
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:38,220
Israel. Just talk to him. I just
talk to Israel. Well, they had

1853
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:43,560
an under boots run boots on the
ground guy, it AlJazeera who,

1854
01:48:44,010 --> 01:48:48,900
even though didn't call by now,
in person on the show, he calls,

1855
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:53,700
he calls by not as a liar for
talking to saying he's talking

1856
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:56,790
to Israel, and he's not. And I
just thought it was so funny to

1857
01:48:56,790 --> 01:49:00,240
listen to this guy go on and on
with all his details about how

1858
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:04,590
this is bullshit. And this is
Biden called out for BS.

1859
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:07,110
Unknown: Let's go to sushi,
hyper tansy, who's in Washington

1860
01:49:07,110 --> 01:49:10,560
DC for us, you have quite a
brief statement, what should we

1861
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:11,130
make of it?

1862
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:13,710
I think perhaps that he's loved
the lesson from Friday night

1863
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:16,140
when he was asked the question
as to whether Israel should

1864
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:19,890
pause the any ground invasion in
order to allow more captives to

1865
01:49:19,890 --> 01:49:23,520
be released? And he said, Yes.
And I think it was almost within

1866
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,610
the hour that the White House
put out an urgent statement

1867
01:49:26,610 --> 01:49:29,760
saying, Oh, no, President Biden
didn't hear the question. He

1868
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:32,520
just thought the journalist
asked whether he hoped that more

1869
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:36,270
hostages should be released. So
now this time, at least he

1870
01:49:36,270 --> 01:49:38,640
didn't make the same mistake. He
simply said he was talking to

1871
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:42,450
Israel. However, we've looked at
the full reports and the

1872
01:49:42,450 --> 01:49:45,360
readouts from Saturday, and he
hasn't talked to the Israelis.

1873
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:48,420
According to those on Saturday.
He did talk to the Prime

1874
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:51,660
Minister Netanyahu on Friday
where the issue of the captors

1875
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:55,050
was raised no conversations with
Israelis, as far as we can tell

1876
01:49:55,050 --> 01:49:57,000
yet as far as from any official
announcements in the White

1877
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:01,290
House. On Saturday, he did talk
to his national security team

1878
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:04,710
about the latest on the Gaza
war. Incidentally, we did just

1879
01:50:04,710 --> 01:50:08,250
also hear that Tony Blinken, the
US Secretary of State, talked to

1880
01:50:08,250 --> 01:50:10,680
the Qatari Prime Minister and
the foreign military Foreign

1881
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:13,680
Minister thanking them for their
mediation efforts with the

1882
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:17,550
release of the to us captives
but also discussing further

1883
01:50:17,550 --> 01:50:20,340
efforts to secure the release of
all the other captives.

1884
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:22,470
Okay, lots of moving parts
thanks for bringing us up to

1885
01:50:22,470 --> 01:50:27,030
speed she had pretends he in
Washington DC so go ahead

1886
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:29,160
John C Dvorak: I just think this
is a little bit you know a

1887
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:33,900
little kind of in the weeds a
bit but at the same time at

1888
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:37,680
least he called Biden out for
his BS or mean he doesn't do

1889
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:39,450
okay whatever you say

1890
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:48,420
Adam Curry: there's gambling
going on. Yes. Our media is is

1891
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:53,220
it's compromised. I don't really
understand do people white

1892
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:55,230
people even watching this
because of the addiction we

1893
01:50:55,230 --> 01:50:59,070
talked about the top of the show
they just people need outrage

1894
01:50:59,070 --> 01:51:03,360
they need they need I need to be
triggered I need to you know

1895
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:09,210
actually this was a this was an
interesting report. Hate say but

1896
01:51:09,210 --> 01:51:13,290
it was MSNBC and they have their
own reasons behind it which I

1897
01:51:13,290 --> 01:51:17,280
think I can deconstruct it comes
into the the loneliness factor

1898
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:19,470
that we were talking about the
other day, all of a sudden,

1899
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:24,120
loneliness is on the on the
menu, loneliness, loneliness,

1900
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:30,930
what's going on with loneliness.
This, this is about well, this

1901
01:51:30,930 --> 01:51:33,660
is a doctor and she's got a book
we'll just set it will set her

1902
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:37,200
up here MSNBC now for the last
two weeks or so painful and

1903
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:40,590
shocking images of war have been
hard to avoid images showing

1904
01:51:40,590 --> 01:51:44,040
pain, destruction and horror. On
television, you can flip the

1905
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:47,460
channel or turn it off
altogether. But on this on your

1906
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:51,780
phone, the endless scrolling can
really have an impact on your

1907
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:54,570
mind and your psychology. If you
are like me, you have felt it.

1908
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:57,990
Let's bring in Dr. Su Verma, she
is a board certified

1909
01:51:57,990 --> 01:52:00,300
psychiatrist and she's author of
fourth of the forthcoming

1910
01:52:00,330 --> 01:52:03,390
practical optimism the art
science and practice of

1911
01:52:03,390 --> 01:52:07,800
exceptional well being. Yeah. So
this is for you parents. I know

1912
01:52:07,860 --> 01:52:10,440
the parents out there and you
know your kids see you your kids

1913
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:12,630
are not stupid, they see you
scrolling you give them

1914
01:52:12,630 --> 01:52:15,240
scrollers they're probably the
kids are probably more

1915
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:17,490
proficient at looking at your
browser history than you are.

1916
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:20,490
Dr. Berman. These are dartle
times we're wondering what you

1917
01:52:20,490 --> 01:52:25,110
think the the biggest impact is
of seeing these images over and

1918
01:52:25,110 --> 01:52:26,640
over again on all our minds.

1919
01:52:27,150 --> 01:52:30,870
Unknown: Yes, so you know,
repeated exposure to graphic

1920
01:52:30,870 --> 01:52:36,030
stressful violent images can
produce anxiety, depression, and

1921
01:52:36,060 --> 01:52:40,560
a feeling of helplessness. Not
to mention anger, frustration,

1922
01:52:41,010 --> 01:52:44,700
and just feeling like we're very
conflicted and and passive as a

1923
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:47,160
result. And I feel like when I
talk to my patients that

1924
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:50,160
helplessness feels so profound,
and for different people,

1925
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:53,100
helplessness can manifest in
different ways. Some people may

1926
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:56,430
tend to turn to substances that
people are doomed scrolling, so

1927
01:52:56,430 --> 01:53:00,780
they continue to look for
violent images. Some people turn

1928
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:03,600
to cyber bullying, because they
feel so angry, and they need to

1929
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:07,050
lash out on somebody, they don't
know where to take it out. So

1930
01:53:07,050 --> 01:53:09,720
it's these are very challenging
times. Indeed, for a lot of

1931
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:11,250
people, even if we're so far
away.

1932
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:14,100
Adam Curry: Yes, I think this is
exactly the behavior I see

1933
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:18,210
exhibited on no agenda social,
that people just get mad at

1934
01:53:18,210 --> 01:53:20,880
anything is I need to get mad. I
need to get mad because I'm mad

1935
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:23,130
about something I can't do what
is going on or something. I just

1936
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:25,860
feel I feel anxious. I'm mad,
I'm mad. I'm mad. How does this

1937
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:29,850
work for children is also just
so casual at the moment, I was

1938
01:53:29,850 --> 01:53:32,730
speaking earlier with a
technology company that tracks

1939
01:53:32,730 --> 01:53:36,570
the behavior of young people
online and did one they all do

1940
01:53:36,570 --> 01:53:41,160
that dude, they were showing me
how quickly a child can go from

1941
01:53:41,430 --> 01:53:45,090
one innocent YouTube search for
something entertaining to maybe

1942
01:53:45,090 --> 01:53:48,630
something educational about
Israel to something absolutely

1943
01:53:48,990 --> 01:53:52,860
unwatchable within a span of a
few minutes and then go back to

1944
01:53:52,860 --> 01:53:54,660
business. As usual. I'm
wondering what do you think the

1945
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:59,400
impact is of this sort of casual
exposure, especially on the

1946
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:03,180
developing brain? Oh, it gets
very fine citizens, upstanding

1947
01:54:03,390 --> 01:54:04,680
members of society.

1948
01:54:04,770 --> 01:54:07,110
Unknown: Yeah. So you know, the
casual exposure can be

1949
01:54:07,110 --> 01:54:10,590
dangerous, because if a young
child doesn't have the context

1950
01:54:10,620 --> 01:54:13,590
around it, and they, they don't
necessarily even have the

1951
01:54:13,590 --> 01:54:16,230
language to be able to express
what they're going through. And

1952
01:54:16,230 --> 01:54:18,510
at the same time, they're
watching these images, and

1953
01:54:18,510 --> 01:54:21,030
they're thinking that this could
be happening to me, like they

1954
01:54:21,030 --> 01:54:24,420
don't have the context of okay,
this is not exactly in my

1955
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:28,710
neighborhood, but it feels so
real. And this sort of 24 hour

1956
01:54:28,740 --> 01:54:31,740
24/7 exposure. It's not like we
have to go out to get it. It's

1957
01:54:31,770 --> 01:54:35,430
coming to us, as you said. And
the other thing is like casual

1958
01:54:35,430 --> 01:54:40,320
exposure also causes numbness
and desensitization. It's a form

1959
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:43,770
of what we call cyber overload
or digital overload when the

1960
01:54:43,770 --> 01:54:46,800
brain is hit with so much
information, even if the

1961
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:50,850
information isn't violent, but
just constant news coming to us.

1962
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:54,300
Our brain wants to shut down and
it shuts down by saying, You

1963
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:56,370
know what, I don't really care.
There's nothing I can do about

1964
01:54:56,370 --> 01:54:59,010
it. And that's the last thing
that we want. We want to be able

1965
01:54:59,010 --> 01:55:02,550
to have some sort of healthy
balance between what I say my

1966
01:55:02,550 --> 01:55:05,580
patients often say, Do I want to
be happy? Or do I want to be

1967
01:55:05,580 --> 01:55:08,610
informed? Because it seems like
we can't be happy and informed

1968
01:55:08,610 --> 01:55:10,020
at the same time, unfortunately.

1969
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:14,460
Adam Curry: I mean, this is
obviously taking place on MSNBC

1970
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:19,200
who themselves are huge
violators of what you're showing

1971
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:24,480
on television. I mean, it was
only a few years ago when Janet

1972
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:30,330
Jackson's nipple was the most
shocking thing we saw. And now,

1973
01:55:30,690 --> 01:55:36,120
thanks, everybody, thanks for
the telegram videos. mean this

1974
01:55:36,150 --> 01:55:38,820
it is not good. It is you can

1975
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:41,490
John C Dvorak: sear the why wait
a minute, you're the one who

1976
01:55:41,490 --> 01:55:45,390
wants to put on television
executions.

1977
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:49,560
Adam Curry: Okay, hold on a
second, we'll get to my purse.

1978
01:55:50,730 --> 01:55:53,580
This is dead. That's a different
story. That's a television

1979
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:57,540
format. And we don't even have a
jingle for it like when loser

1980
01:55:57,540 --> 01:56:05,280
drone. I'm saying that with
social media. And it doesn't

1981
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:10,260
matter if it's x or Facebook or
Mastodon or telegram. Telegram,

1982
01:56:10,290 --> 01:56:15,240
I think is actually the worst.
It Real telegram is really,

1983
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:17,820
really, really toxic. And

1984
01:56:17,850 --> 01:56:20,520
John C Dvorak: it's not it's not
that thank tic TOCs pretty bad

1985
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:20,880
keeping

1986
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:26,730
Adam Curry: telegram is it's all
bad. And we're professionals.

1987
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:31,050
We're older. We've grown up with
this. We understand why, for

1988
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:33,990
some reason, were able to look
at it with some distance. It

1989
01:56:33,990 --> 01:56:37,560
doesn't affect me. But I see I
see my brothers and sisters have

1990
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:42,000
no agenda nation affected, and
they used to not be so affected

1991
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:42,720
by this stuff.

1992
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:45,240
John C Dvorak: And I see your
sisters literally.

1993
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:50,910
Adam Curry: My sisters. Yes.
Yeah. All right. You got me

1994
01:56:50,910 --> 01:56:53,700
confused with Andrew Horowitz.
Okay, last quick. I feel like

1995
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:54,840
John C Dvorak: this is the best

1996
01:56:54,929 --> 01:56:57,629
Adam Curry: important thing to
contrast also between, you know,

1997
01:56:57,629 --> 01:57:00,509
happiness and informed when it
comes to it really being

1998
01:57:00,509 --> 01:57:05,699
important to inform people with
the most jarring images, right?

1999
01:57:05,699 --> 01:57:08,399
I mean, back when we first saw
images of war during Vietnam,

2000
01:57:08,399 --> 01:57:11,639
for instance, right, it shaped
our perception of that conflict,

2001
01:57:11,639 --> 01:57:15,059
it was utterly shocking to see
those images. But now, with

2002
01:57:15,059 --> 01:57:16,979
social media and with
smartphones, it seems like

2003
01:57:16,979 --> 01:57:19,319
something has changed. I wonder
what you think, you know,

2004
01:57:19,319 --> 01:57:21,119
obviously, there's this
individual effect. But what is

2005
01:57:21,119 --> 01:57:24,509
the sort of social effect you
think of becoming desensitized

2006
01:57:24,509 --> 01:57:25,559
as it seems we're being

2007
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:29,250
Unknown: lack of empathy is
what's happening is that when we

2008
01:57:29,250 --> 01:57:34,170
feel so passive, helpless, angry
about things that, you know,

2009
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:38,160
whether they're close to home or
far from home, we end up

2010
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:40,320
becoming more passive, right.
And so sometimes we think that

2011
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:43,260
like putting comments online,
while they are very helpful, and

2012
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:46,140
can be educating some people, a
lot of the comments,

2013
01:57:46,140 --> 01:57:49,560
unfortunately, are negative or
angry and hostile and create

2014
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:52,920
more and more divide. So there
is a very delicate balance. And

2015
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:55,530
I feel like empathy is so
important and being able to talk

2016
01:57:55,530 --> 01:57:58,200
to people from very different
points of views. I'm seeing so

2017
01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:01,500
much clash and divide between
within families within friends

2018
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:05,610
circles, and it's very hard time
right now to be able to get

2019
01:58:05,610 --> 01:58:08,280
yourself informed because you're
only hearing things from a

2020
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:09,270
certain perspective.

2021
01:58:09,330 --> 01:58:12,750
John C Dvorak: So what you heard
there was an anti Trump screed

2022
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:18,270
Of course there is anti empathy
is a yes, buzzword codeword for

2023
01:58:18,270 --> 01:58:20,580
Adam Curry: Trump. So here's
what I'd like to suggest for no

2024
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:26,730
agenda nation, I call for a JCD
Monday. Be like, I

2025
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:27,840
Unknown: mean, be like

2026
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:32,100
Adam Curry: JCD, put your phone
in a drawer, a drawer, leave it

2027
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:36,450
there and leave it there for all
of Monday. And I command

2028
01:58:36,450 --> 01:58:40,020
everyone to go to a no agenda
meet up. You can talk about

2029
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:44,220
whatever you want. But you need
to be in social contact with

2030
01:58:44,220 --> 01:58:48,420
real people. I'm saying we need
to love each other. If only in

2031
01:58:48,420 --> 01:58:52,560
our own community. This I can
see we're breaking people are

2032
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:55,770
people. I don't care about
anybody else. I don't care about

2033
01:58:55,770 --> 01:58:58,950
anyone else's listeners. We have
producers and they're breaking.

2034
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:04,170
Be like JCD be like spike be be
like my campaign be like John be

2035
01:59:04,170 --> 01:59:09,360
like JCD put your phone in the
drawer on Monday. And go to a

2036
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:14,070
meet up find a meet up this week
or next weekend. It's it's good

2037
01:59:14,070 --> 01:59:15,840
for you. So I went to

2038
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:19,200
John C Dvorak: the meetup. Yes.
Tell us how was it? It was

2039
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:23,160
great. We had about 35 people
the guy who's organized it is

2040
01:59:23,190 --> 01:59:28,260
Elizabeth Warren Rohnert Park,
and he's a new organizer and he

2041
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:31,530
wants to do these meetups more
often he's a nice guy and the

2042
01:59:31,860 --> 01:59:37,470
group was great, good looking
group. And there was a there was

2043
01:59:37,470 --> 01:59:42,630
a Scott Adams look like it was a
socialist kid who came up says

2044
01:59:42,630 --> 01:59:45,630
hey, I'm a socialist. No way you
guys ragging on socialist I

2045
01:59:45,630 --> 01:59:47,580
agree with most of what you're
saying but yeah, hate

2046
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:50,370
socialists. And what did you
submit? I tried to explain but

2047
01:59:50,370 --> 01:59:55,650
he didn't listen. And but he
donated so that's good, but but

2048
01:59:55,650 --> 01:59:59,100
there you go, but this is the
point of socialist donation. No,

2049
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:00,660
you got something going Right

2050
02:00:00,690 --> 02:00:03,330
Adam Curry: yeah but this is
good so I'm glad that he came

2051
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:06,210
good on him yeah I'm cool he's a
good guy nice guy because he

2052
02:00:06,210 --> 02:00:09,540
felt safe that's why he felt
safe in that environment this is

2053
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:10,110
very good.

2054
02:00:10,410 --> 02:00:13,290
John C Dvorak: Oh yeah it was
the bars nice has been redone

2055
02:00:13,290 --> 02:00:15,480
since I was there less than I
don't know how long many years

nurse

2060
02:00:28,530 --> 02:00:31,290
Unknown: and any hotties Yak?
Yeah.

2061
02:00:31,349 --> 02:00:34,589
John C Dvorak: So he's a hottie
or two or three any spooks?

2062
02:00:36,389 --> 02:00:38,129
Maybe, maybe

2063
02:00:38,610 --> 02:00:40,590
Adam Curry: you're not it's not
a complete meet up until you've

2064
02:00:40,590 --> 02:00:41,730
spotted the fella there

2065
02:00:41,730 --> 02:00:44,310
John C Dvorak: may be I mean,
it's possible that one guy was

2066
02:00:44,310 --> 02:00:47,550
because he had everything going
on, you know, the kind of

2067
02:00:48,570 --> 02:00:53,520
sketchy background they kind of
look as possible. That was a

2068
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:54,060
spook.

2069
02:00:55,980 --> 02:00:58,830
Adam Curry: Got a breaking news,
breaking news, breaking news

2070
02:00:59,700 --> 02:01:04,440
from our lawyer who has been
following the Missouri versus

2071
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:09,360
Biden trial. Oh, yes. And there
is and he's been. I love this

2072
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:12,990
guy. He's a pro bono. Of course,
he's a producer. And he's just

2073
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:16,020
sending me updates. He goes
through all the documentation,

2074
02:01:16,050 --> 02:01:19,560
all the briefs that are being
filed. It's reams of paperwork.

2075
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:24,270
He loves doing it. And I want to
read his report. Justice Alito

2076
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:28,860
referred the government's motion
for a stay to the full court.

2077
02:01:29,130 --> 02:01:33,150
Now, just to remind you, this is
the state of Missouri suing the

2078
02:01:33,150 --> 02:01:35,670
Biden administration. I think
it's the Biden ministration, not

2079
02:01:35,670 --> 02:01:39,600
just Biden, personally, for
threatening social media

2080
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:44,760
companies to take down content,
threatening them with Hey, you

2081
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:48,450
know, we got section 230, you're
killing people with this video

2082
02:01:48,450 --> 02:01:52,050
with you're missing
disinformation. And as we've

2083
02:01:52,050 --> 02:01:54,870
learned that the courts are even
saying this is the most

2084
02:01:54,900 --> 02:01:58,500
egregious violation of the First
Amendment rights ever in

2085
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:01,860
American history. And the media
really doesn't report on it

2086
02:02:01,860 --> 02:02:04,920
much, because why would they?
They're in Biden's pocket and

2087
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:09,270
they hate social media
companies. So Alito has referred

2088
02:02:09,270 --> 02:02:11,850
the government's motion to full
stay with the full court. This

2089
02:02:11,850 --> 02:02:15,000
is not unheard of, but
definitely not the norm. To make

2090
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:18,060
things even more unusual. The
Supreme Court treated the motion

2091
02:02:18,060 --> 02:02:22,410
for stay as a cert petition.
This cuts out an entire step

2092
02:02:22,410 --> 02:02:25,350
from the Supreme Court review
process. So the bottom line,

2093
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:29,520
Supreme Court has accepted the
case for review. Remember, now

2094
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:32,880
this went from the from the
Missouri court, which I don't

2095
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:36,060
remember but circuit that is it
went to the Supreme Court,

2096
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:39,060
instead of kicking it back. Now
it goes to the Supreme Court for

2097
02:02:39,060 --> 02:02:42,000
review, it will determine
whether the district court and

2098
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,420
by extension, the Fifth Circuit
Daigo got it right. In

2099
02:02:45,420 --> 02:02:49,590
condemning the Feds laundering
of censorship. The media has no

2100
02:02:49,590 --> 02:02:52,350
choice now, but to report on
this. Hopefully, you are well

2101
02:02:52,350 --> 02:02:54,060
equipped to get a jump on
things.

2102
02:02:55,290 --> 02:02:57,600
John C Dvorak: Okay, well, we'll
see.

2103
02:02:57,900 --> 02:03:02,670
Adam Curry: Yes. And he says,
And he attached for my reading

2104
02:03:02,670 --> 02:03:05,400
pleasure, the supreme court's
order, which includes a dissent

2105
02:03:05,790 --> 02:03:10,200
from justices Alito, Thomas and
Gorsuch, who wanted to deny the

2106
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:13,470
state altogether. It's a very
short five pages take a look and

2107
02:03:13,470 --> 02:03:17,520
see the point in a nutshell,
Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch are

2108
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:21,030
worried what will happen in the
next election. And that's really

2109
02:03:21,030 --> 02:03:25,410
what this is about, is what can
be done from the White House

2110
02:03:25,410 --> 02:03:30,150
during the next election. Can
they you know, hey, Trump's a

2111
02:03:30,150 --> 02:03:30,810
criminal.

2112
02:03:31,830 --> 02:03:34,830
John C Dvorak: Take it off, or
something like that. Those are

2113
02:03:34,830 --> 02:03:36,210
conservative judges.

2114
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:38,910
Adam Curry: I know. But I'm not
sure exactly what to

2115
02:03:39,030 --> 02:03:41,640
John C Dvorak: I want a
clarification on this. Okay.

2116
02:03:41,700 --> 02:03:44,910
Adam Curry: Both point of order.
Point of order.

2117
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:50,580
John C Dvorak: So I got some
China News, China clips kind of

2118
02:03:50,610 --> 02:03:54,300
kind of China, kind of China. We
haven't talked about much, but I

2119
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:55,140
think we should.

2120
02:03:55,680 --> 02:03:59,100
Adam Curry: Yeah, they're not in
play right now. But okay. I

2121
02:03:59,100 --> 02:04:01,050
mean, we have ramped up dad's

2122
02:04:01,260 --> 02:04:03,780
John C Dvorak: time to start to
look at it. Okay, good point.

2123
02:04:03,810 --> 02:04:07,590
Good point. Let's start with
wielding a sword we I got two

2124
02:04:07,590 --> 02:04:12,330
series of clips. One is on
illegal Bio Lab in California.

2125
02:04:12,900 --> 02:04:15,660
Adam Curry: This story has been
around you know, but of course,

2126
02:04:15,690 --> 02:04:19,380
of course this happened months
ago. But now it's it's getting

2127
02:04:19,380 --> 02:04:20,130
some attention

2128
02:04:20,160 --> 02:04:22,800
John C Dvorak: and the rest of
it the guy's disappeared to

2129
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:26,400
Unknown: go and arrest over the
illegal Chinese Bio Lab in

2130
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:30,330
California. It contained
bacterial viruses such as SARS,

2131
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:35,400
COVID and HIV. Now authorities
say they've arrested a man NTDs

2132
02:04:35,430 --> 02:04:38,760
David Lam speaks with an epic
Times reporter who spent several

2133
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:41,850
weeks uncovering the web of
connections tied to the Reedley

2134
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:43,050
California lab.

2135
02:04:43,110 --> 02:04:45,480
Steve is first with the epic
times. Thank you for joining me

2136
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:48,930
today. What's the significance
of this arrest? Do we realize

2137
02:04:48,930 --> 02:04:54,120
that the people behind this
company they have a very

2138
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:57,840
complicated and complex
background and very troubling

2139
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:01,350
background. They have been
involved With several companies

2140
02:05:01,410 --> 02:05:04,860
in at least 10 countries that we
have looked at, and they've all

2141
02:05:04,860 --> 02:05:08,130
been in trouble with the law,
the mastermind of his operation

2142
02:05:08,430 --> 02:05:12,120
is someone by the name of Jesse
Zhu. He's the one that controls

2143
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:16,230
all of these companies. So Jesse
do this as a 62 year old man

2144
02:05:16,230 --> 02:05:21,210
that is a Chinese citizen, and
formerly lived in Clovis. So

2145
02:05:21,570 --> 02:05:24,720
what are some of the charges
that he's facing? He's actually

2146
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:28,710
a Canadian citizen as well. So
the charges for what which was

2147
02:05:28,710 --> 02:05:33,330
arrested yesterday are
manufacturing and distributing

2148
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:38,040
unbranded medical devices that
are not registered with the FDA.

2149
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:42,690
And also for making false
statements to the FDA, including

2150
02:05:42,690 --> 02:05:46,380
his name, he, he, he uses a fake
identity, these are just still

2151
02:05:46,380 --> 02:05:50,100
charges. If convicted, he could
be in jail for x up to eight

2152
02:05:50,100 --> 02:05:53,940
years. How did this illegal
operation was running for so

2153
02:05:53,940 --> 02:05:56,970
long before it came into the
public's eye, or the code

2154
02:05:56,970 --> 02:06:00,870
enforcement officer? What see
what they do is they they move

2155
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:05,310
from city to city, they change
company names. And as I realized

2156
02:06:05,310 --> 02:06:09,600
yesterday, they even change
identity names of the people. So

2157
02:06:09,630 --> 02:06:12,900
universal Meditec, which was the
main company that was involved

2158
02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:19,200
with the Bio Lab, has been going
through Fresno, Tulare, Reedley

2159
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:22,380
back to Fresno back to Tulare,
back to really

2160
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:25,590
Adam Curry: now is, is my
understanding that the illegal

2161
02:06:25,590 --> 02:06:30,090
medical devices were in fact
tests like COVID tests.

2162
02:06:32,670 --> 02:06:34,830
John C Dvorak: Yeah, they never
mentioned this specific share,

2163
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:37,380
they just kept going on. What I
thought was interesting about

2164
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:40,140
this is the description of the
guy changing names and

2165
02:06:40,140 --> 02:06:44,730
locations. About 10 years ago,
we had a Chinese producer, maybe

2166
02:06:44,820 --> 02:06:49,680
12 years ago, we had a Chinese
producer who had corresponded

2167
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:52,410
with quite a bit and he told me
that this is the way you do

2168
02:06:52,410 --> 02:06:55,740
business in China, if you're, if
you're a criminal. And these

2169
02:06:55,740 --> 02:06:58,680
criminal groups get together and
they create companies that did,

2170
02:06:58,830 --> 02:07:02,910
these are the guys who produce
aircraft parts

2171
02:07:02,910 --> 02:07:05,070
Adam Curry: funny, this is how
the Biden's operate to.

2172
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:09,990
John C Dvorak: Yeah, this is
very funny. You produce aircraft

2173
02:07:09,990 --> 02:07:13,800
part your illegal aircraft parts
with phony certificates, and you

2174
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:16,770
do business as long as you can.
And as soon as they they get

2175
02:07:16,770 --> 02:07:20,130
wind of what you're up to you
close shop, move, change your

2176
02:07:20,130 --> 02:07:22,950
name moved to a different city
and start doing the same thing.

2177
02:07:22,950 --> 02:07:25,230
And you do this over and over
and over again, you could do it

2178
02:07:25,230 --> 02:07:29,610
free. According to him. This guy
says you could do this forever.

2179
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,730
In China as long as he because
it's just it's just the way it

2180
02:07:32,730 --> 02:07:35,550
is as long as it goes on here
now

2181
02:07:35,580 --> 02:07:41,580
Adam Curry: Oh, no doubt what we
have no moral authority over any

2182
02:07:41,580 --> 02:07:42,510
other country

2183
02:07:44,190 --> 02:07:47,910
John C Dvorak: versus the
purchase, carry character.

2184
02:07:48,390 --> 02:07:50,970
Unknown: All of these people
controlling these companies are

2185
02:07:50,970 --> 02:07:55,200
also very closely related to
companies in China that are

2186
02:07:55,200 --> 02:08:00,240
related also to this Jesse do
person. But all of this was not

2187
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:04,230
regulated was not approved by
the FDA. Going back to the

2188
02:08:04,230 --> 02:08:08,250
background of the Canadian
companies. Jesse Zhu and his

2189
02:08:08,250 --> 02:08:13,320
companies have been sued by by
the Canadian entities. They've

2190
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:18,660
been sued several times up to
$330 million dollars for damages

2191
02:08:18,690 --> 02:08:22,140
done to those companies. Now he
didn't pay a penny of that he

2192
02:08:22,140 --> 02:08:25,710
found ways around it and legal
loopholes, Steve Espers with the

2193
02:08:25,710 --> 02:08:28,410
epic times. Thank you so much
for joining me. Thank you for

2194
02:08:28,410 --> 02:08:31,290
having me. Yeah.

2195
02:08:32,070 --> 02:08:34,440
John C Dvorak: Which brings us
to the second series of clips,

2196
02:08:34,470 --> 02:08:38,640
which is this is not reported in
this country. As far as I can

2197
02:08:38,640 --> 02:08:41,040
tell. I don't know anything
about this. I heard it on the

2198
02:08:41,070 --> 02:08:45,420
New Tang Dynasty. This is the
graphite story you know about

2199
02:08:45,420 --> 02:08:46,410
the graphite story.

2200
02:08:47,910 --> 02:08:50,070
Adam Curry: This is not
graphene, but graphite.

2201
02:08:50,130 --> 02:08:53,130
Graphite. Graphite is graphite.

2202
02:08:53,550 --> 02:08:56,940
John C Dvorak: Graphite is a is
a form of carbon one of the many

2203
02:08:56,940 --> 02:09:01,440
forms of carbon diamonds one of
them okay, and it's used a lot

2204
02:09:01,470 --> 02:09:06,180
in it turns out who new battery
in the same in the semiconductor

2205
02:09:06,180 --> 02:09:08,730
business and in batteries in
particular.

2206
02:09:10,260 --> 02:09:12,360
Adam Curry: Okay, no wonder it's
a China story.

2207
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:15,630
Unknown: China is planning to
restrict exports of a crucial

2208
02:09:15,630 --> 02:09:18,720
mineral used to make Evie
batteries. officials announced

2209
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:21,930
today that permits will be
required for certain graphite

2210
02:09:21,930 --> 02:09:25,770
products. He spoke to entity
business host Don MA for more.

2211
02:09:27,210 --> 02:09:29,100
Don Ma, thank you so much for
joining us.

2212
02:09:29,190 --> 02:09:30,510
Yeah, thanks for having me
today.

2213
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:34,380
Before we get to the China part,
give us a little bit of the

2214
02:09:34,380 --> 02:09:35,430
background here.

2215
02:09:35,670 --> 02:09:39,300
Sure. First of all, China is the
world's top producer of

2216
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:43,350
graphite. And according to the
US Geological Survey, China

2217
02:09:43,350 --> 02:09:48,420
accounts for two thirds of the
growth global supply. China also

2218
02:09:48,420 --> 02:09:51,780
refines more than 90% of the
world's graphite into material

2219
02:09:51,780 --> 02:09:56,310
used virtually in all Evie
batteries. So you know China is

2220
02:09:56,310 --> 02:09:59,970
an important player here in this
front. And the reason why

2221
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,200
graphite is important as because
graphite is the largest Evie

2222
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:08,610
battery component by weight, and
almost double the amount of

2223
02:10:08,610 --> 02:10:13,350
lithium in an Eevee battery. But
besides EVs graphite is also

2224
02:10:13,350 --> 02:10:16,080
commonly used in the
semiconductor aerospace,

2225
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:20,700
chemical and steel industries.
And top buyers of graphite are

2226
02:10:21,030 --> 02:10:25,770
Japan, the US and a couple of
other countries. What doesn't

2227
02:10:25,770 --> 02:10:27,300
Adam Curry: China have that we
need?

2228
02:10:27,390 --> 02:10:31,890
John C Dvorak: Get it? How does
China out has outmaneuvered us?

2229
02:10:32,700 --> 02:10:38,340
In everything we're just sit
around flat footed are scions of

2230
02:10:38,340 --> 02:10:43,050
industry who make 2030 $40
million a year as CEOs don't do

2231
02:10:43,050 --> 02:10:46,320
crap about it because they're
incompetent. And here we go

2232
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:50,400
again. And this is all because
we cut because Biden cut the

2233
02:10:50,610 --> 02:10:55,740
supply of AI chips, mostly from
Nvidia to China. So now now you

2234
02:10:55,740 --> 02:10:59,040
got you got to you get these
chips. Is that going to be good

2235
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:02,340
for us? So you can't have the
chips. And so China just says

2236
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:04,680
okay, you can't have the
graphite as part two.

2237
02:11:04,950 --> 02:11:08,520
Unknown: And now why is China
limiting exports of this crucial

2238
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:09,060
mineral.

2239
02:11:09,420 --> 02:11:12,870
So according to the official
statement, as for national

2240
02:11:12,870 --> 02:11:16,260
security reasons, China's
commerce ministry said the move

2241
02:11:16,260 --> 02:11:19,260
was to ensure stability of the
global supply chain and

2242
02:11:19,260 --> 02:11:22,620
industrial chain, and to better
safeguard national security and

2243
02:11:22,620 --> 02:11:26,460
interests. It added that it was
not targeting any specific

2244
02:11:26,460 --> 02:11:31,200
country. But that's the official
reason. But some analysts are

2245
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:35,010
questioning whether you know,
this is a tit for tat measure

2246
02:11:35,010 --> 02:11:38,940
against the US, because
Washington on Tuesdays said it

2247
02:11:38,940 --> 02:11:42,360
plans to halt shipments of more
advanced artificial intelligence

2248
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:46,410
chips to China. And three days
later, here we are at Beijing

2249
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:50,580
officials announcing these
graphite curves. So the timing

2250
02:11:50,580 --> 02:11:53,250
may be curious to some of the
Dutch

2251
02:11:53,250 --> 02:11:55,440
Adam Curry: press was just
reading yesterday, they're

2252
02:11:55,440 --> 02:12:00,000
complaining about how ASML who
do the lithography for chips,

2253
02:12:00,270 --> 02:12:05,640
they the Dutch government now
has no say over what goes to

2254
02:12:05,640 --> 02:12:09,270
China. It's all Washington.
Yeah, they've completely

2255
02:12:09,270 --> 02:12:13,080
capitulated. And they didn't. So
that's all part of this tit for

2256
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:16,740
tat was. So what does this mean?
Ultimately, no one gets chips

2257
02:12:16,740 --> 02:12:18,600
and you keep your laptop.

2258
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:21,990
John C Dvorak: I mean, it's
gonna, likely the machines are

2259
02:12:21,990 --> 02:12:29,340
built to last. I think there's a
last. I think there's a third

2260
02:12:29,340 --> 02:12:30,270
clip here, there is

2261
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:33,300
Unknown: an on that last part,
what will be the impact of these

2262
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:33,900
curves,

2263
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:37,320
right. So under these new
restrictions, which will take

2264
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:41,070
effect in December, China is
going to require exporters to

2265
02:12:41,070 --> 02:12:45,300
apply for permits to ship
certain types of graphite. And

2266
02:12:45,300 --> 02:12:49,110
the curves are actually similar
to those placed on chip making

2267
02:12:49,110 --> 02:12:53,070
metals gallium and germanium
from a few months ago. And from

2268
02:12:53,100 --> 02:12:56,940
what we've seen with that, those
restrictions, they have

2269
02:12:56,940 --> 02:13:00,660
effectively choked off exports
of those metals and pushed up

2270
02:13:00,660 --> 02:13:04,200
prices outside of the country.
So that's a reference. But what

2271
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:07,740
analysts are also saying is that
the impact could be that the

2272
02:13:07,740 --> 02:13:11,850
average price of graphite will
continue to rise in the future.

2273
02:13:12,090 --> 02:13:16,050
But this control is not a
complete ban, and there has been

2274
02:13:16,050 --> 02:13:20,160
no significant impact on any
industry during the previous

2275
02:13:20,160 --> 02:13:24,360
temporary controls. And this
also raises the question,

2276
02:13:24,360 --> 02:13:28,830
though, of how dependent on
China does the US want to be in

2277
02:13:28,830 --> 02:13:33,180
the context of the
electrification of vehicles and

2278
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:37,200
potentially highlights the need
for the West to perhaps have

2279
02:13:37,290 --> 02:13:40,770
independent supply chains and
self sufficiency in both raw

2280
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:43,590
materials and downstream
components?

2281
02:13:43,620 --> 02:13:46,230
Adam Curry: Forget the chips for
a minute the jobs forget the

2282
02:13:46,230 --> 02:13:51,660
jobs won't this time it this
should tank the already stupid

2283
02:13:51,660 --> 02:13:55,110
Evie market can we just already
Can we just say that this is

2284
02:13:55,110 --> 02:13:58,650
dumb that this was a bad idea
and everybody who bought into

2285
02:13:58,650 --> 02:14:02,040
the electric vehicle is going to
get screwed? Your battery's a

2286
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:05,970
third the cost of the vehicle.
No one wants to buy your car

2287
02:14:05,970 --> 02:14:09,570
secondhand. You might as well
lease it so you're leasing the

2288
02:14:09,570 --> 02:14:13,410
battery? I mean, isn't this all
just a dumb idea what won't we

2289
02:14:13,410 --> 02:14:16,920
just go back to explosive
engines combustion engines

2290
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:19,320
John C Dvorak: Well I hope so
but you know they've they've

2291
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:23,280
promoted this very well and you
get a superstar promoters like

2292
02:14:23,310 --> 02:14:27,900
Elon Musk doesn't help things
doesn't help. You know what

2293
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:29,100
should be I mean,

2294
02:14:29,100 --> 02:14:33,300
Adam Curry: I know I see. Like I
see nothing but EVs on the lots

2295
02:14:33,300 --> 02:14:39,090
everywhere. Hundreds of EVs
unsold that people don't want

2296
02:14:39,090 --> 02:14:39,810
them anymore.

2297
02:14:40,020 --> 02:14:42,360
John C Dvorak: Well, actually,
even in China. There's these

2298
02:14:42,360 --> 02:14:45,210
photos that these people have
taken with drones have these

2299
02:14:45,210 --> 02:14:50,970
huge piles of unsold EVs that
are backing up now from these

2300
02:14:50,970 --> 02:14:52,920
Evie companies, because China's
making

2301
02:14:53,130 --> 02:14:54,840
Adam Curry: two or three and
these boundaries, they keep

2302
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:57,870
exploding everywhere. It's
annoying. You can't

2303
02:14:57,870 --> 02:15:01,950
John C Dvorak: put them in your
garage. You to blow up the

2304
02:15:01,950 --> 02:15:04,860
garage and warehouse, you're
going to charge you got to put a

2305
02:15:04,860 --> 02:15:08,460
wire out to the car out and
sitting in the driveway. Does

2306
02:15:08,460 --> 02:15:12,510
that make sense? When kids would
come by you know, and you know,

2307
02:15:12,510 --> 02:15:14,910
throw it in a bucket or
something. I mean, you just

2308
02:15:14,910 --> 02:15:18,060
didn't know when to do we
haven't seen the vandalism yet.

2309
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:22,800
Adam Curry: Before we take a
break a follow up on a clip that

2310
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:28,800
we played in March from two of
my favorite radio guys. weenie

2311
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:32,490
in the bud from Russia. I forget
their actual vo Vanya, those

2312
02:15:32,490 --> 02:15:37,290
guys. Oh, Vaughn and Alexis
Vaughn Lexus in the morning. And

2313
02:15:37,290 --> 02:15:42,390
they hoax Fifi Lagarde, the
director of the Euro European

2314
02:15:42,390 --> 02:15:48,360
Central Bank into admitting that
a digital Euro a central bank

2315
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:51,750
digital currency was on the way
a reminder. Well, I have a

2316
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:54,990
question about it, and they
pretended to be Zelinsky. And

2317
02:15:54,990 --> 02:15:58,980
she was all like Linsky and she
was primping her hair before the

2318
02:15:58,980 --> 02:16:01,800
call. Like who I came, I'm gonna
be talking to Lindsay, this is

2319
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:03,420
when he was still hot news.

2320
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:09,210
Unknown: I'm also a good user of
electronic money. So my

2321
02:16:09,210 --> 02:16:14,460
question, you're introducing the
electronic era as I know, so,

2322
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:18,570
how can I be up? How can
switching to an electronic

2323
02:16:18,570 --> 02:16:19,500
currency help?

2324
02:16:20,670 --> 02:16:25,380
But two things Number one, it
will be decided in October. So

2325
02:16:26,220 --> 02:16:30,930
we are preparing the ground, we
want to be ready. We want to be

2326
02:16:30,930 --> 02:16:36,180
trained, but it will not be
decided until October 23. The

2327
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:43,020
reason I'm personally convinced
that we have to move ahead is a

2328
02:16:43,020 --> 02:16:48,360
situation like the one we are in
now. We are dependent on a

2329
02:16:48,360 --> 02:16:55,140
supply of gas by a very
unfriendly country. I don't want

2330
02:16:55,170 --> 02:17:01,230
Europe to be dependent on an
unfriendly country's currency,

2331
02:17:01,260 --> 02:17:05,010
for instance, I don't know, you
know, the Chinese currency, the

2332
02:17:05,010 --> 02:17:10,620
Russian currency, the whatever,
or dependent on a friendly

2333
02:17:10,620 --> 02:17:16,350
currency but which is activated
by a private corporate entity,

2334
02:17:16,440 --> 02:17:22,080
like, you know, Facebook or like
Google or anybody like

2335
02:17:22,410 --> 02:17:26,670
Adam Curry: I'm user of Bitcoin
to Okay. Okay. Then he goes in

2336
02:17:26,670 --> 02:17:30,480
all that. So she said, October
23, we're laying the groundwork

2337
02:17:30,480 --> 02:17:34,080
and then she went into such so
like, oh, you know, it'll be

2338
02:17:34,740 --> 02:17:38,160
like, there'll be limited people
can you know, if we won't track

2339
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:42,000
you unless you spend over 300
euros, then them all sudden the

2340
02:17:42,180 --> 02:17:44,790
the machines wake up and will
track you and don't worry, you

2341
02:17:44,790 --> 02:17:49,230
won't sell your information.
What I like about Fifi is she

2342
02:17:49,230 --> 02:17:53,190
doesn't mess around. They made
the decision five days early on

2343
02:17:53,190 --> 02:17:55,200
October 18. The digital

2344
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:59,640
Unknown: euro is on the move.
Yesterday, the Governing Council

2345
02:17:59,670 --> 02:18:05,880
of the ECB approved the opening
of the preparation phase, it

2346
02:18:05,880 --> 02:18:09,750
will be a journey, and we will
walk the journey together with

2347
02:18:09,750 --> 02:18:15,000
the legislator. All European
institutions will be involved to

2348
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:19,110
make sure that Europe is
equipped with the currency of

2349
02:18:19,110 --> 02:18:25,980
the future. Cash is here to
stay. You will have all options,

2350
02:18:26,400 --> 02:18:31,110
cash, and digital cash digital
cash. So what does it mean for

2351
02:18:31,110 --> 02:18:37,860
you? For consumers? It will be
free and easy to use everywhere

2352
02:18:37,980 --> 02:18:42,210
in the euro area. All of that,
of course is subject to the

2353
02:18:42,210 --> 02:18:47,880
legislative process. Cash or
digital. The choice will be

2354
02:18:47,880 --> 02:18:52,050
euros. You Euro your choice.
Yeah,

2355
02:18:52,050 --> 02:18:55,110
Adam Curry: your Euro your
choice. Yeah, but we want to

2356
02:18:55,110 --> 02:18:58,920
make sure you choose the digital
option and we are already going

2357
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:01,800
out and doing some weak ass
advertising.

2358
02:19:02,580 --> 02:19:06,300
Unknown: Imagine a digital
single payment solution that can

2359
02:19:06,300 --> 02:19:11,250
be used for any kind of payment
throughout the euro area. Guess

2360
02:19:11,250 --> 02:19:18,180
what? It could become a reality.
The digital Euro. Easy, safe,

2361
02:19:18,600 --> 02:19:23,700
fast, reliable digital money
from the European Central Bank

2362
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:29,850
at your fingertips whenever you
need it. How would it work?

2363
02:19:30,780 --> 02:19:33,840
You've gone for a meal with a
friend and you want to split the

2364
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:38,490
bill. Simple. Open the digital
Euro wallet on your smartphone.

2365
02:19:38,580 --> 02:19:41,730
Check your balance. Enter the
amount of pay your friend

2366
02:19:42,060 --> 02:19:45,690
confirm your transfer. Your
friend will receive the money

2367
02:19:45,720 --> 02:19:49,470
instantly free of charge. It
doesn't matter which country

2368
02:19:49,470 --> 02:19:53,160
you're in or who your payments
provider is payments are still

2369
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:57,000
made instantly even offline.
It's also easy to use the

2370
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:00,810
digital Euro at your favorite
local shops. Gotta unlock your

2371
02:20:00,810 --> 02:20:05,250
device, place it on the terminal
authenticate, make the payments

2372
02:20:05,370 --> 02:20:09,840
online or offline. If you want,
you can also use a physical

2373
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:14,910
card. What about e commerce? The
digital euro is also available

2374
02:20:14,910 --> 02:20:18,960
when you're buying something
online via digital or physical,

2375
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:22,770
the euro will always be a euro
and have the same value

2376
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:28,350
irrespective of format. Let's
embrace the digital era. Digital

2377
02:20:28,350 --> 02:20:28,830
Euro.

2378
02:20:29,699 --> 02:20:32,789
Adam Curry: That's right. And
every digital Euro comes with a

2379
02:20:32,789 --> 02:20:33,779
digital ID.

2380
02:20:35,220 --> 02:20:39,330
John C Dvorak: Let me get this
straight here. So I'm at a

2381
02:20:39,330 --> 02:20:43,260
restaurant. Now in the olden
days, I want to split the bill

2382
02:20:43,260 --> 02:20:47,010
with somebody we throw our cards
down both of us. Yeah. And the

2383
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:50,010
restaurant takes care of it.
Give us a couple separate bills.

2384
02:20:51,690 --> 02:20:53,730
Simple ups, it couldn't be
easier.

2385
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:56,910
Adam Curry: That's not true. You
always made me pay with a

2386
02:20:56,910 --> 02:20:57,780
company card.

2387
02:20:59,880 --> 02:21:01,170
John C Dvorak: Generally
speaking,

2388
02:21:02,220 --> 02:21:04,980
Adam Curry: he won't admit it.
You're always made me pay.

2389
02:21:05,670 --> 02:21:09,120
John C Dvorak: Yeah, cuz you had
the you had the MVNO company

2390
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:12,840
card. Yeah, that was dynamite.
luceplan What's the point we're

2391
02:21:12,840 --> 02:21:17,610
going to bvo times good times,
those days are over. So but the

2392
02:21:17,610 --> 02:21:20,790
point is you normally go out
with somebody wants to throw the

2393
02:21:20,790 --> 02:21:24,510
cards down, it's all day. Now.
Instead, I gotta give a phone on

2394
02:21:24,510 --> 02:21:29,460
me. I gotta open the phone. I
got to scroll through my apps

2395
02:21:29,460 --> 02:21:32,580
and get this app up, and I gotta
find it. And then I gotta log

2396
02:21:32,580 --> 02:21:35,160
in. And then I gotta click on
something. I gotta find the

2397
02:21:35,160 --> 02:21:38,580
other guy's name. And I gotta
send him some money. And then he

2398
02:21:38,580 --> 02:21:41,940
pays the bill. This is like
ridiculously complicated

2399
02:21:41,940 --> 02:21:45,210
compared to throwing the card
down and letting the restaurant

2400
02:21:45,210 --> 02:21:47,610
take care of the the complexity

2401
02:21:47,640 --> 02:21:50,910
Adam Curry: this will never work
because you left your phone in

2402
02:21:50,910 --> 02:21:54,390
the drawer. And that's how you
get out of paying the bill it's

2403
02:21:54,390 --> 02:21:55,170
a bonus for

2404
02:21:55,170 --> 02:21:58,770
John C Dvorak: you duel for me
yeah nuts arguing about that

2405
02:21:58,770 --> 02:22:03,600
part but of course this heart
that we're not gonna work well I

2406
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:05,160
Adam Curry: liked it David
promote anything it'll do

2407
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:08,250
offline. How does that work? How
does it do offline payments with

2408
02:22:08,250 --> 02:22:11,850
does it connect to the internet
later? I mean, I'd have to

2409
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,160
obviously that seems kind of
odd.

2410
02:22:14,400 --> 02:22:16,770
John C Dvorak: No, the whole
thing it has to have a it has to

2411
02:22:16,770 --> 02:22:22,410
have some thing in the car. It
has to be a chip card chip smart

2412
02:22:22,410 --> 02:22:26,130
card that has information in the
chip that kind of alludes to the

2413
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:28,110
fact that you have a bunch of
money in your account.

2414
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:31,050
Adam Curry: Well the two things
to look out for are one the

2415
02:22:31,050 --> 02:22:35,220
digital ID that will come with
this that's just a given and to

2416
02:22:35,820 --> 02:22:40,560
the possibility to European
Central Bank's into is a bank

2417
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:46,560
digital money from the central
bank is classified as a cbdc and

2418
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:51,330
they will be able to inflate or
deflate the money supply at will

2419
02:22:51,330 --> 02:22:54,390
take it take your money away.
Yeah, they could cut you off.

2420
02:22:54,390 --> 02:22:57,960
It's a beautiful thing. Yay
Europe you're good to go. You're

2421
02:22:57,990 --> 02:23:02,340
it's your Euro your choice. And
with that, I'd like to thank you

2422
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:04,500
very much for your currency in
the morning to you the man who

2423
02:23:04,500 --> 02:23:08,790

02:23:08,790 --> 02:23:10,260

2425
02:23:16,260 --> 02:23:18,420
John C Dvorak: C Bucha graph in

2426
02:23:18,420 --> 02:23:18,960
nights out there

2427
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:21,090
Adam Curry: in the morning to
the control room. Hello.

2428
02:23:27,870 --> 02:23:34,590
We got 2077 on the troll counts
20770. I'm noting these and

2429
02:23:34,590 --> 02:23:36,930
we're 223 into it.

2430
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:38,490
John C Dvorak: Yes, hello.

2431
02:23:40,470 --> 02:23:42,120
Adam Curry: Everything with us
just low.

2432
02:23:42,449 --> 02:23:46,019
John C Dvorak: Less low is very
low. Average on Sundays 24.

2433
02:23:46,050 --> 02:23:51,510
Adam Curry: Low t we got low T
low trolls low T. But anyway, we

2434
02:23:51,510 --> 02:23:55,320
love our trolls. Because they're
here. This is the only place

2435
02:23:55,320 --> 02:23:59,490
where it's healthy for you to
binge. And to get all your

2436
02:23:59,490 --> 02:24:03,240
triggering immediately. Just do
it. Do it. Do it only for three

2437
02:24:03,240 --> 02:24:06,840
hours, twice a week. That's what
we recommend and just stay off

2438
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:10,170
of everything else. Put your
phone in the drawer be like JCD

2439
02:24:11,550 --> 02:24:15,750
you can join the trolls at the
troll room troll room.io or use

2440
02:24:15,750 --> 02:24:19,380
a modern podcast app. You'll
want one eventually. You can you

2441
02:24:19,380 --> 02:24:22,740
can trust me on that. Do you
know that John Stewart got

2442
02:24:22,740 --> 02:24:25,470
cancelled by Apple? His podcast?

2443
02:24:25,529 --> 02:24:27,749
John C Dvorak: He quit. Okay,

2444
02:24:28,439 --> 02:24:32,459
Adam Curry: there were creative
differences over China and ai

2445
02:24:34,290 --> 02:24:35,970
John C Dvorak: do we talked
about this in the last show?

2446
02:24:36,030 --> 02:24:38,940
Adam Curry: No. No, we didn't
talk about maybe maybe you

2447
02:24:38,940 --> 02:24:42,690
talked about it on DHL
unplugged. I haven't heard DHL

2448
02:24:42,690 --> 02:24:43,380
blog this week.

2449
02:24:44,550 --> 02:24:46,680
John C Dvorak: Anyway, you gotta
cancel these out. Yeah, get

2450
02:24:46,680 --> 02:24:50,850
Adam Curry: them on podcast that
podcast apps.com pod verse now

2451
02:24:50,850 --> 02:24:54,480
does Android Auto and I think
they're going to do Car Play or

2452
02:24:54,480 --> 02:24:57,390
something like that. So these
things are getting pretty good.

2453
02:24:57,510 --> 02:24:59,790
Getting pretty modern doing
things. Well. I

2454
02:24:59,790 --> 02:25:01,470
John C Dvorak: did. came up with
dinner that's what it was

2455
02:25:01,470 --> 02:25:07,290
because another Gao quit this
guy he did. The team left is a

2456
02:25:07,290 --> 02:25:12,750
new startup that's that's headed
creatively by John Lasseter out

2457
02:25:12,750 --> 02:25:16,620
of Disney he was the guy was who
was cancelled from Disney for

2458
02:25:16,710 --> 02:25:21,540
being too much of a hugger in
Calif in Southern California. Oh

2459
02:25:21,570 --> 02:25:28,080
my god. Oh no, he's hugging
these women constantly go and he

2460
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:31,980
did a start up but this guy's
Apple hired him on and they they

2461
02:25:31,980 --> 02:25:36,480
all walked off in a huff and
went to Netflix for more money.

2462
02:25:36,540 --> 02:25:40,500
No to Apples can't keep it
together. They're gonna eat at

2463
02:25:40,500 --> 02:25:43,800
the by Disney. I mean they their
creativity.

2464
02:25:44,640 --> 02:25:47,040
Adam Curry: Can they even make a
joke? Can I even make chips

2465
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:48,090
without the graphite?

2466
02:25:50,100 --> 02:25:52,320
John C Dvorak: So they're not
making the chips or designing

2467
02:25:52,320 --> 02:25:57,420
the chips. Oh, okay. So to the
foundries to get the graphite. I

2468
02:25:57,420 --> 02:25:57,630
think

2469
02:25:57,630 --> 02:25:59,790
Adam Curry: Apple's heyday may
be over. What do you think?

2470
02:26:00,330 --> 02:26:03,420
John C Dvorak: Well, the thing
is a couple of things. Since

2471
02:26:03,420 --> 02:26:07,890
we're talking about it, one JC
has the latest version three

2472
02:26:07,890 --> 02:26:12,870
that about the newest of the new
folding Samsung phones. The

2473
02:26:13,110 --> 02:26:16,080
phone? Yeah, it's a killer.

2474
02:26:16,830 --> 02:26:19,200
Adam Curry: What is the benefit
of a folding phone?

2475
02:26:19,470 --> 02:26:23,100
John C Dvorak: Oh, it's just a
vis smaller when you fold it up,

2476
02:26:23,100 --> 02:26:27,630
it hangs up on your folded down
you get to slam it down. It's

2477
02:26:28,020 --> 02:26:32,550
works like a champ. It's got a
terrific screen. It's a it's

2478
02:26:32,550 --> 02:26:36,000
just a marvelous product. I
would say that the second day

2479
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:39,270
when it's taken share away from
Apple. The second thing is the

2480
02:26:39,270 --> 02:26:44,670
Huawei phone in China is killing
apple. Hmm. They're getting beat

2481
02:26:44,670 --> 02:26:48,360
up badly on their phone and then
they're not in fact, we talked

2482
02:26:48,360 --> 02:26:50,550
about this at the dinner table
when we talked about Jon

2483
02:26:50,550 --> 02:26:54,510
Stewart, which was why didn't
apple and if Steve Jobs was

2484
02:26:54,510 --> 02:26:57,930
running the place still that
folding phone that Samsung has

2485
02:26:58,050 --> 02:26:59,460
would have been an Apple phone.

2486
02:27:01,470 --> 02:27:03,570
Adam Curry: Yeah, I don't know.
I mean, I liked the

2487
02:27:03,570 --> 02:27:06,150
John C Dvorak: idea of having
got a touchscreen laptop for

2488
02:27:06,150 --> 02:27:07,950
God's sake. I liked

2489
02:27:07,950 --> 02:27:10,080
Adam Curry: the idea of rage
quitting your phone like the old

2490
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:13,440
flip phone days like scroll.
Yeah, like slap it closed. I

2491
02:27:13,440 --> 02:27:14,070
kind of like that.

2492
02:27:14,310 --> 02:27:16,020
John C Dvorak: That's you can do
that with his phone.

2493
02:27:16,050 --> 02:27:18,750
Adam Curry: I stopped still
using my light phone mainly.

2494
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:19,710
Yeah, that's

2495
02:27:19,710 --> 02:27:22,350
John C Dvorak: fine. I'm trying
to get any phone so I'm just

2496
02:27:22,350 --> 02:27:25,320
telling you what I'm observing
from other you know what's going

2497
02:27:25,320 --> 02:27:30,420
on. I like the Samsung folding
phone I don't have one. I don't

2498
02:27:30,420 --> 02:27:33,960
intend to get one I'm probably
too expensive and

2499
02:27:34,199 --> 02:27:36,509
Adam Curry: twit is really
missing out on you they need you

2500
02:27:36,539 --> 02:27:38,909
these are time because they're
going to be all googoo gaga over

2501
02:27:38,909 --> 02:27:43,049
that thing. And they need us
they need you to go I don't want

2502
02:27:43,049 --> 02:27:48,149
that phone and to change the
language to Korean Russians even

2503
02:27:48,149 --> 02:27:51,239
better i favorite trick my
favorite Jhansi divorce a great

2504
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:53,460
John C Dvorak: trick for people
that don't know that trick I'll

2505
02:27:53,460 --> 02:27:56,970
tell you because anyone can do
this to anybody asked to borrow

2506
02:27:56,970 --> 02:28:01,140
someone's phone quickly go to
the settings go to the languages

2507
02:28:01,140 --> 02:28:04,950
and turn the language to Chinese
and then give them to us from

2508
02:28:04,950 --> 02:28:08,340
back and back to the homescreen
and back to the home screen and

2509
02:28:08,340 --> 02:28:09,300
then you're good to go

2510
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:13,440
Adam Curry: and then your
friends for life you did that to

2511
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:18,030
me once and I was I was a bit
disturbed by it I don't remember

2512
02:28:18,030 --> 02:28:20,370
what phone that was but I
remember you doing this and I

2513
02:28:20,370 --> 02:28:20,670
was like

2514
02:28:20,699 --> 02:28:23,849
John C Dvorak: yeah, that's a
good guy. It's funny. Yeah it

2515
02:28:23,849 --> 02:28:27,569
made you very popular with the
kids it makes you know it unless

2516
02:28:27,569 --> 02:28:30,299
you know how to get back to the
settings and sometimes they have

2517
02:28:30,299 --> 02:28:35,129
the icons will help you and it
but if but with some phones

2518
02:28:35,129 --> 02:28:39,659
especially earlier like 10 years
ago these phones were such that

2519
02:28:39,839 --> 02:28:42,689
you didn't have you couldn't
figure out how to get the

2520
02:28:42,689 --> 02:28:46,319
language back and you had to go
basically to your computer go

2521
02:28:46,319 --> 02:28:52,139
online and you know look it up
and it was very annoying I was

2522
02:28:52,139 --> 02:28:53,489
surprised I didn't get punched

2523
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:58,590
Adam Curry: Have you never been
punched for just being you know

2524
02:28:58,590 --> 02:29:00,180
amazing amazing.

2525
02:29:00,630 --> 02:29:03,510
John C Dvorak: I haven't I have
a it's my attitude

2526
02:29:03,570 --> 02:29:05,790
Adam Curry: has no one I've just
come a sucker punch you just for

2527
02:29:05,790 --> 02:29:06,570
being you know,

2528
02:29:06,570 --> 02:29:09,720
John C Dvorak: you'd think yeah,
I don't want to put it in

2529
02:29:09,720 --> 02:29:13,320
anyone's mind. I'm on my guard
for sucker punches

2530
02:29:15,360 --> 02:29:20,520
Adam Curry: we so tomorrow you
can you can follow us but there

2531
02:29:20,520 --> 02:29:23,970
will be nothing happening. Um no
agenda social because everyone

2532
02:29:23,970 --> 02:29:28,410
will be doing it taking a JCD be
like JCD day. Put your phone in

2533
02:29:28,410 --> 02:29:32,040
the drawer tomorrow but on
Tuesday you can follow John C

2534
02:29:32,040 --> 02:29:37,650
Dvorak at no agenda social.com
Adam at no agenda social.com And

2535
02:29:38,610 --> 02:29:44,730
yes then not interact with us um
um, I'm going to try and I

2536
02:29:44,730 --> 02:29:45,210
interact

2537
02:29:45,210 --> 02:29:47,070
John C Dvorak: you with two
people I blocked both of you I

2538
02:29:47,070 --> 02:29:47,550
saw

2539
02:29:48,810 --> 02:29:51,180
Adam Curry: John's like I'm
always on no agenda social. I

2540
02:29:51,180 --> 02:29:55,200
see your no agenda social. What
are you talking about black. I

2541
02:29:55,530 --> 02:29:56,520
know what you were mad.

2542
02:29:56,580 --> 02:29:59,550
John C Dvorak: They were going
after you and the show the

2543
02:29:59,550 --> 02:30:05,010
studio From people, and they're
gonna lie down and one of them

2544
02:30:05,010 --> 02:30:09,570
who's I thought was a friend of
the show and some female and she

2545
02:30:09,570 --> 02:30:10,920
said, I can't remember who she
is.

2546
02:30:12,719 --> 02:30:16,199
Adam Curry: This is the one who
said, but I just stopped

2547
02:30:16,199 --> 02:30:17,849
donating. That's my face

2548
02:30:17,850 --> 02:30:20,220
John C Dvorak: that Yes, that
one. She says, Well, I still

2549
02:30:20,220 --> 02:30:23,700
listen to the show. But I
stopped donating because she was

2550
02:30:23,700 --> 02:30:26,460
very arrogant about it, because
this other guy was going on this

2551
02:30:26,460 --> 02:30:30,810
show stinks. And I said, What
are you even on no agenda social

2552
02:30:30,810 --> 02:30:33,900
for to tell us at the show
sting? I think I blocked that

2553
02:30:33,900 --> 02:30:35,400
guy. And I blocked her,

2554
02:30:35,579 --> 02:30:39,569
Adam Curry: I think is that she
said, I just get back at him by

2555
02:30:39,599 --> 02:30:42,809
by not donating to the show. And
I said, I used the Jhansi

2556
02:30:42,809 --> 02:30:46,859
Dvorak, I said, noted. And I
thought that would be the end of

2557
02:30:46,859 --> 02:30:50,309
it. And then she got really mad.
I'm like, I gave all my money to

2558
02:30:50,309 --> 02:30:51,899
you. I know rather what

2559
02:30:51,900 --> 02:30:53,880
John C Dvorak: she'd already
said she stopped doing that,

2560
02:30:53,880 --> 02:30:56,880
too. She's that she's overboard.
For all practical purposes, you

2561
02:30:56,880 --> 02:30:57,630
should have blocked her

2562
02:30:59,430 --> 02:31:02,280
Adam Curry: block. I only
blocked that one guy because he

2563
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:06,810
just filled up my timeline just
annoying. Yeah, it doesn't

2564
02:31:06,810 --> 02:31:08,850
matter. I'm just lurking now

2565
02:31:09,060 --> 02:31:11,190
John C Dvorak: rubbed me the
wrong way you get blocked.

2566
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:15,930
Adam Curry: Value for value is
the proposition. If you find no

2567
02:31:15,930 --> 02:31:20,310
value, then don't support the
show. If you do find value, then

2568
02:31:20,310 --> 02:31:21,150
support the show.

2569
02:31:21,570 --> 02:31:23,670
John C Dvorak: You don't quit
grousing, if you don't support

2570
02:31:23,670 --> 02:31:27,060
you know, just don't support the
show. Yeah. Is that setting

2571
02:31:27,060 --> 02:31:31,110
grousing and trying to get other
people not to support to show

2572
02:31:32,340 --> 02:31:35,400
that's what I don't like that's
what I blocked her for. She was

2573
02:31:35,400 --> 02:31:40,440
going on. She was firstly trying
to keep donations away from the

2574
02:31:40,440 --> 02:31:40,710
show.

2575
02:31:40,710 --> 02:31:43,080
Adam Curry: And that stopped her
you think about you blocking her

2576
02:31:43,140 --> 02:31:43,500
know

2577
02:31:43,740 --> 02:31:46,080
John C Dvorak: that they have to
listen to okay.

2578
02:31:47,550 --> 02:31:50,130
Adam Curry: Just even tomorrow
don't even Oh, she

2579
02:31:50,130 --> 02:31:52,920
John C Dvorak: wrote get to see
any of the fabulous memes that I

2580
02:31:52,920 --> 02:31:53,430
post.

2581
02:31:54,450 --> 02:31:57,480
Adam Curry: Oh, god, you're you
have not posted any memes. I

2582
02:31:57,480 --> 02:32:00,780
haven't seen any memes from you.
Yeah, I posted it because oh,

2583
02:32:00,780 --> 02:32:06,120
there's only one guy I like who
posted it? And it's weird. But I

2584
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:11,520
like the guy. No. Baray I think
it is p post classic muscle cars

2585
02:32:12,660 --> 02:32:14,040
like that. I like those. That's

2586
02:32:14,070 --> 02:32:17,310
John C Dvorak: like Food Wars
memes. He does a lot of them. He

2587
02:32:17,340 --> 02:32:21,690
gets newsletter material from
him. Well, good

2588
02:32:21,690 --> 02:32:26,190
Adam Curry: for you. Yeah. So
throughout the years, people

2589
02:32:26,190 --> 02:32:29,550
have supported the show in many
ways, time and talent is a big

2590
02:32:29,550 --> 02:32:32,580
one. You can organize a meetup.
And then you really I mean,

2591
02:32:32,580 --> 02:32:35,460
you're doing it for no agenda,
nation no matter what. But when

2592
02:32:35,460 --> 02:32:37,620
you organize a meetup, you're
doing it for your brothers and

2593
02:32:37,620 --> 02:32:41,640
sisters. So you really need to
if you can organize a meetup,

2594
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:44,220
that's a great way to help.
There's so many different ways

2595
02:32:44,220 --> 02:32:46,770
you can help getting other
people to listen. But not

2596
02:32:46,770 --> 02:32:50,400
helping is telling people not to
donate. And that's not time.

2597
02:32:50,430 --> 02:32:53,520
That's not a help helpful value
for value. No, it's negative.

2598
02:32:53,550 --> 02:32:58,650
It's negative value is envy,
envy for V. Now artwork we love

2599
02:32:58,680 --> 02:33:02,280
because it first of all, it's an
act of love, because artists are

2600
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:06,060
putting their their creativity
out there, ready to be

2601
02:33:06,060 --> 02:33:10,350
criticized, which is our way of
loving you back. It is true,

2602
02:33:10,530 --> 02:33:13,320
because you normally do stuff on
spec, you don't hear anything

2603
02:33:13,320 --> 02:33:16,440
from anybody. They just ignore
you don't even get a phone call

2604
02:33:16,440 --> 02:33:20,490
back. And when we'd love to
having a new piece of art for

2605
02:33:20,490 --> 02:33:23,910
every single episode is great.
It gets people's attention. It

2606
02:33:23,910 --> 02:33:27,360
looks good when you post it, it
looks great in the podcast apps.

2607
02:33:28,050 --> 02:33:31,080
And we do have, you know, rules
and stuff that we need to adhere

2608
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:34,110
to like, Yes, I go to read it
and we'd like stuff that pops

2609
02:33:34,110 --> 02:33:37,050
but that we break those from
time to time. And of course,

2610
02:33:37,050 --> 02:33:39,240
whenever there's a special
episode like the last one,

2611
02:33:39,240 --> 02:33:42,870
episode 1600 That's when you can
be pretty sure that we're going

2612
02:33:42,870 --> 02:33:46,680
to go for something that boasts
about the fact that it's 1600

2613
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:51,300
episodes and Sir Suge, aka faux
Diddley, he did that and then

2614
02:33:51,300 --> 02:33:57,360
some and brought us the Infinity
artwork of 16 years. 1600

2615
02:33:57,360 --> 02:34:00,720
episodes. You liked it right off
the bat, you went straight for

2616
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:02,400
it and said, I like this one.

2617
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:06,240
John C Dvorak: Yeah, I like it
because I liked the use of

2618
02:34:06,540 --> 02:34:10,890
infinite perspective. And
vanishing point. I'm sorry.

2619
02:34:10,890 --> 02:34:14,250
Here's what I meant. Vanishing
Point. I think he used it well,

2620
02:34:14,670 --> 02:34:16,740
and we were talking about you
know, the vanishing point has

2621
02:34:16,740 --> 02:34:19,650
something to do with some of the
issues in the show is great.

2622
02:34:19,650 --> 02:34:20,010
Great.

2623
02:34:20,970 --> 02:34:23,580
Adam Curry: We looked at a
couple other pieces. I did keep

2624
02:34:23,580 --> 02:34:28,770
coming back to Parker Polly's
tramp stamp, but I don't know

2625
02:34:28,770 --> 02:34:35,610
why. I thought it was well
executed. The sweet 16 And what

2626
02:34:35,610 --> 02:34:37,620
else by the way, you can follow
this and no agenda art

2627
02:34:37,620 --> 02:34:40,500
generator.com You can also
upload anyone can participate in

2628
02:34:40,500 --> 02:34:44,100
this. You're more than welcome.
Also, a lot of these show up in

2629
02:34:44,100 --> 02:34:48,660
our chapters and those modern
podcast apps. I liked to have

2630
02:34:48,660 --> 02:34:51,360
something that I liked. I can't
remember what it was.

2631
02:34:51,420 --> 02:34:52,740
John C Dvorak: He really liked
much.

2632
02:34:53,490 --> 02:34:57,450
Adam Curry: No, I did. Did. I
can't remember. I don't know um,

2633
02:34:57,450 --> 02:34:57,570
look.

2634
02:34:57,570 --> 02:35:01,890
John C Dvorak: It was a lot of
art but it was was to do a

2635
02:35:01,890 --> 02:35:05,670
complaining about certain. I
don't remember who Oh, he first

2636
02:35:05,670 --> 02:35:07,230
of all decided we're going to
use 16.

2637
02:35:07,950 --> 02:35:10,680
Adam Curry: Yeah, I know what it
was it was capitalist agenda,

2638
02:35:11,160 --> 02:35:17,970
whose art was really if you blow
it up the 60s down at the bottom

2639
02:35:17,970 --> 02:35:22,920
of the page. The 1600 is kind of
peeling off this cube. It's

2640
02:35:22,920 --> 02:35:25,860
flowing over. I really liked
that piece. Yeah, that's a piece

2641
02:35:25,860 --> 02:35:27,810
I'd like to have on my wall. I
mean, I

2642
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:29,550
John C Dvorak: I'd frame that
that was the light to

2643
02:35:29,550 --> 02:35:30,930
dimensionality. Yeah,

2644
02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:34,890
Adam Curry: thank you. But it's
somehow it doesn't work. I'm not

2645
02:35:34,890 --> 02:35:38,760
sure why it is something just
doesn't work in a small format.

2646
02:35:38,760 --> 02:35:43,980
I guess. They had to he did two
of them. You know, something,

2647
02:35:44,040 --> 02:35:45,720
John C Dvorak: it has his moment
and

2648
02:35:45,720 --> 02:35:49,320
Adam Curry: has had his moment.
However, we do want to thank Bo

2649
02:35:49,320 --> 02:35:52,530
Diddley for bringing us the
artwork for episode number 1600.

2650
02:35:52,830 --> 02:35:55,950
And the title of that one was
unpackage. We just heard one

2651
02:35:55,950 --> 02:35:58,710
theory where that came from. We
appreciate that very much. And

2652
02:35:58,710 --> 02:36:02,820
thank you to all the artists for
what you do. It is highly

2653
02:36:02,850 --> 02:36:08,040
appreciated. Now there's Phoebe,
ABC something or somebody. Tina

2654
02:36:08,040 --> 02:36:10,260
is still out. She's still in
Utah. That's

2655
02:36:10,260 --> 02:36:12,570
John C Dvorak: where you go to
overloaded the show with Eclipse

2656
02:36:12,570 --> 02:36:13,050
today,

2657
02:36:13,080 --> 02:36:15,270
Adam Curry: but you're the one
with the Eclipse.

2658
02:36:16,590 --> 02:36:18,330
John C Dvorak: No, I know. But
I'm saying you had a

2659
02:36:18,360 --> 02:36:23,370
presentation. You had deep
dives. You had a follow up you

2660
02:36:23,370 --> 02:36:27,870
had you looked into this group
of screwballs. And you had the

2661
02:36:27,870 --> 02:36:30,690
information even this is what
happens. Are you complaining?

2662
02:36:30,990 --> 02:36:35,640
No, I was fine. I was just
relaxing. But it was very

2663
02:36:35,640 --> 02:36:38,670
entertaining. It was
educational. It's educational.

2664
02:36:38,670 --> 02:36:38,910
Have

2665
02:36:38,910 --> 02:36:40,680
Adam Curry: a new schedule. I
got up early this morning. I'm

2666
02:36:40,680 --> 02:36:45,150
getting up early again. Oh, good
for you. Yeah. So I had had more

2667
02:36:45,150 --> 02:36:47,430
work and I did some You're
right. I did do some of the work

2668
02:36:47,430 --> 02:36:49,320
yesterday, right? Yeah.

2669
02:36:49,650 --> 02:36:51,030
John C Dvorak: The show gets
better. We're sitting there

2670
02:36:51,030 --> 02:36:53,820
bored. I guess so.

2671
02:36:54,120 --> 02:36:56,070
Adam Curry: Let's Yeah, let's
thank the treasurer. We have a

2672
02:36:56,070 --> 02:36:59,220
lot of PhDs in coming today
which is good to see we kick it

2673
02:36:59,220 --> 02:37:06,870
off with Brandon Jansen. Just as
US does not have a state in his

2674
02:37:07,710 --> 02:37:09,060
so I don't know where he's from.

2675
02:37:09,540 --> 02:37:12,450
John C Dvorak: But he Jaden D I
don't know

2676
02:37:13,050 --> 02:37:14,190
Adam Curry: where he has a note.

John C Dvorak: Came into it
though check and he came with a

2678
02:37:18,120 --> 02:37:22,770
check for some amount and then

02:38:46,560 --> 02:38:52,050
Rogan donation appearance.
However, it was not ready for to

2698
02:38:52,080 --> 02:38:55,410
I was not ready to absorb the
information and analysis.

2699
02:38:56,460 --> 02:38:58,890
Adam Curry: Yes, you have to be
ready for this. Yes, true.

2700
02:38:59,820 --> 02:39:03,870
John C Dvorak: I agree. Fast
forward to the beginning of 2023

2701
02:39:04,230 --> 02:39:10,500
after six shots No, I didn't say
that. I was I was feeling lost

2702
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:16,290
with my previous worldview.
Having been shattered after all

2703
02:39:16,290 --> 02:39:20,850
the relentless psyops beating me
down you both still sounded

2704
02:39:20,850 --> 02:39:27,330
crazy, but but only because I I
was in fact I was the crazy one

2705
02:39:27,360 --> 02:39:33,360
Oh, ah he gave KK he woke up. I
went back to twitch January

2706
02:39:33,360 --> 02:39:38,010
2022, and proceeded to listen to
all the years episodes. In

2707
02:39:38,010 --> 02:39:42,570
addition to brought me up to
date with the current episodes.

2708
02:39:42,570 --> 02:39:46,410

basically Holy crap. These guys

2709
02:39:46,410 --> 02:39:51,420

says to himself, and he went on

2710

and on he goes on I don't want
to read the whole thing.

2711
02:39:53,520 --> 02:39:57,480
Ignorance is bliss, but luckily
I've come to be I've come to

2712
02:39:57,480 --> 02:40:02,220
realize that it is better to
know With the truth, tend to be

2713
02:40:02,220 --> 02:40:07,650
comforted with lies. The first
step is admittedly that I've

2714
02:40:07,650 --> 02:40:15,720
been duped. I've been duped
which is not easy but but

2715
02:40:16,260 --> 02:40:20,670

not be complete without a shout

give carnivorous plants some
ammonium nitrate? I don't know.

2874
02:50:25,200 --> 02:50:30,120
I don't know about it. They
probably won't like it. Nothing

2875
02:50:30,120 --> 02:50:33,450
guy was yet to feed it with a
spoon. That's the problem. I

2876
02:50:33,450 --> 02:50:37,350
want to give a shout out to my
favorite podcast app RSS radio

2877
02:50:37,350 --> 02:50:41,310
by durata software not part of
the podcasting 2.0 Echo system

2878
02:50:41,310 --> 02:50:44,160
but hoping it will be. It was
one of the first apps to offer

2879
02:50:44,220 --> 02:50:48,060
silence, skip and provide an
equalizer was really cool as you

2880
02:50:48,060 --> 02:50:50,910
can group your podcast into
different categories that you

2881
02:50:50,910 --> 02:50:54,690
create. That sounds familiar.
And if you like the episodes

2882
02:50:54,690 --> 02:50:57,570
artwork, the app shows you the
URL of the image for

2883
02:50:57,570 --> 02:51:01,260
downloading. The app can also
display chapters and live stream

2884
02:51:01,260 --> 02:51:04,830
if you have a link. I got my PMP
certification so I'm going to

2885
02:51:04,830 --> 02:51:08,010
get a job as calm I need one.
Thanks sincerely, sir rich

broken leg. But I should mention

2914
02:53:04,860 --> 02:53:10,620
he's also the guy. As far as I
know, who did a whole slew of no

02:53:10,620 --> 02:53:13,920
agenda stickers, which we gave
out to everybody that we could

2916
02:53:14,100 --> 02:53:17,130
and they are dynamite. They're
mostly little covers that are

2917
02:53:17,130 --> 02:53:21,270
about one inch by one Angelo's
show album art and some other

2918
02:53:21,270 --> 02:53:25,530

it is nice. They're not it was a

3173
03:10:28,830 --> 03:10:34,020

Lame. No, I made you one of them

3174
03:10:34,020 --> 03:10:37,950
just did that generic I would
say they're evergreen. Oh, okay.

3175
03:10:38,250 --> 03:10:41,250
Evergreens Yes. Now one of them
may not be good for the show.

3176
03:10:41,250 --> 03:10:44,040
Let's start with that one
despicable it's despicable

3177
03:10:44,040 --> 03:10:48,120
Adam Curry: and corrupt it's not
bad it's not

3178
03:10:48,120 --> 03:10:50,100
John C Dvorak: boring. And the
other one is the is the

3179
03:10:50,100 --> 03:10:52,680
Evergreen if you can't come up
with anything good this has to

3180
03:10:52,680 --> 03:10:54,990

3181
03:10:55,470 --> 03:10:57,870

3183
03:11:01,050 --> 03:11:04,590
joining us today. It's a little
out of balance. Sorry, what

03:11:04,620 --> 03:11:09,960

think this bowl, but I have I

3185
03:11:09,960 --> 03:11:13,050
have a couple to select from and
I think I have winners here.

3186
03:11:13,830 --> 03:11:16,170
Unknown: The algorithms are
running everything it turns out.

3187
03:11:17,400 --> 03:11:18,600
Adam Curry: Little long.

3188
03:11:19,830 --> 03:11:21,480
Unknown: But what do you know?

3189
03:11:23,970 --> 03:11:28,650
Adam Curry: Oh my god. That was
really stressful. Too long. This

3190
03:11:28,680 --> 03:11:33,030
I think this is the one podcast
canceled. I think that's that's

3191
03:11:33,030 --> 03:11:33,480
good. You'd

3192
03:11:33,480 --> 03:11:35,070
John C Dvorak: run this with
last time

3193
03:11:35,190 --> 03:11:39,150
Adam Curry: podcast canceled. I
didn't run that one. Okay, I

3194
03:11:39,150 --> 03:11:39,270
will

3195
03:11:39,270 --> 03:11:41,460
John C Dvorak: go with I like
it. I like actually like all

3196
03:11:41,460 --> 03:11:42,180
four years.

3197
03:11:42,240 --> 03:11:47,970
Adam Curry: Oh, do podcast
cancel. Okay, I have a I have an

3198
03:11:47,970 --> 03:11:51,150
Africa clip for the end of show
but I am overriding the after

3199
03:11:51,150 --> 03:11:54,570
the one Africa clip end of show
for

3200
03:11:55,050 --> 03:11:57,420
John C Dvorak: this week before
I do Africa in the show. I got

3201
03:11:57,420 --> 03:11:59,700
two clips about Biden in the
smoking gun.

3202
03:11:59,760 --> 03:12:01,890
Adam Curry: Oh, brother. Really?
You're going to bring the whole

3203
03:12:01,890 --> 03:12:02,790
show down?

3204
03:12:03,690 --> 03:12:05,580
Unknown: No, it's not that bad.
Okay.

3205
03:12:07,050 --> 03:12:08,460
John C Dvorak: Look for
something. Okay. I could do a

3206
03:12:08,460 --> 03:12:09,690
Ukrainian update.

3207
03:12:09,810 --> 03:12:13,350
Adam Curry: Now. What's this a
bummer. Look, it's it's three

3208
03:12:13,350 --> 03:12:19,350
hours and 12 minutes. You're
trying to elongate the show. I

3209
03:12:19,350 --> 03:12:22,080
can put this off. I think you
should put that off because I

3210
03:12:22,080 --> 03:12:23,340
have an entertainment clip.

3211
03:12:23,820 --> 03:12:26,490
John C Dvorak: Okay, we'll go
with you. And we'll do what you

3212
03:12:26,490 --> 03:12:28,740
what you say you have the
control. I

3213
03:12:28,740 --> 03:12:30,510
Adam Curry: have the con George
Clooney. Let's

3214
03:12:30,510 --> 03:12:32,730
Unknown: talk about George
Clooney. He wants to see actors

3215
03:12:32,880 --> 03:12:35,970
back at work. So he's putting
his money where his mouth is.

3216
03:12:36,150 --> 03:12:38,880
The Oscar winner and other top
Hollywood stars are offering a

3217
03:12:38,880 --> 03:12:43,410
proposal worth $150 million
dollars to encourage sag AFTRA

3218
03:12:43,410 --> 03:12:46,260
to end the strike that just
started in July now. Clooney

3219
03:12:46,260 --> 03:12:49,740
spokesperson confirms the offer
it would remove the cap undos

3220
03:12:49,740 --> 03:12:53,280
from the union's highest
earners, raising an extra 150

3221
03:12:53,280 --> 03:12:56,670
million over the next three
years for member benefits. Sag

3222
03:12:56,670 --> 03:12:59,610
AFTRA, President Fran Drescher
doe went on Instagram, she

3223
03:12:59,610 --> 03:13:02,460
thanked George Clooney for the
quote, extremely generous offer.

3224
03:13:02,460 --> 03:13:06,150
But she also elaborated it does
not impact the contract that the

3225
03:13:06,150 --> 03:13:09,060
actors actually want. She said
that under the law,

3226
03:13:09,330 --> 03:13:12,180
contributions for pension and
health funds of a federally

3227
03:13:12,210 --> 03:13:16,170
regulated Labor Union must come
from employers. It can't come

3228
03:13:16,170 --> 03:13:18,960
from the people who are the
members of that union. It has to

3229
03:13:18,960 --> 03:13:22,080
come from from the employers. So
talks between striking actors

3230
03:13:22,080 --> 03:13:24,630
and major studios. They broke
down last week the actor strike

3231
03:13:24,630 --> 03:13:29,730
will markets 100 day tomorrow.
So So French, of course, she

3232
03:13:29,730 --> 03:13:32,370
acknowledges that it's a
generous offer. But because

3233
03:13:32,370 --> 03:13:35,580
there are things that the actors
are looking for that have to do

3234
03:13:35,610 --> 03:13:39,870
with AI that have to do with
streaming and residuals, the 150

3235
03:13:39,870 --> 03:13:42,960
million that's just cash doesn't
address those

3236
03:13:44,100 --> 03:13:47,100
other facilities saying I'm just
trying to help. Yeah. And

3237
03:13:47,100 --> 03:13:48,210
I think that they welcome that.

3238
03:13:48,360 --> 03:13:52,260
It is tough, though, to hear I'm
coming up with $150 million. No,

3239
03:13:52,260 --> 03:13:53,490
thanks. But no, thanks

3240
03:13:53,490 --> 03:13:54,720
for Yeah, Thanks for Thanks. But

3241
03:13:54,720 --> 03:13:57,960
yeah, but But I understand the
point she's making as well, if I

3242
03:13:57,960 --> 03:13:59,850
have other issues that need to
be addressed, can't they do

3243
03:13:59,850 --> 03:14:00,090
both?

3244
03:14:00,120 --> 03:14:03,300
Right? Because it's like, okay.
We'll be happy to say yeah,

3245
03:14:04,230 --> 03:14:06,270
like, let's not talk about the
things that are really on the

3246
03:14:06,270 --> 03:14:07,230
table. And that

3247
03:14:08,460 --> 03:14:12,630
removes the studio from their
responsibility. Why can't you do

3248
03:14:12,630 --> 03:14:13,500
both?

3249
03:14:15,870 --> 03:14:17,130
We're looking forward to now

3250
03:14:17,130 --> 03:14:20,430
we'll just say thank you,
George. For your pocket.

3251
03:14:22,860 --> 03:14:24,870
Adam Curry: You know, he's back
on the say you get some

3252
03:14:27,510 --> 03:14:28,320
distraction.

3253
03:14:33,720 --> 03:14:38,100
He's coming back. He's coming
back. He's making a comeback.

3254
03:14:38,880 --> 03:14:40,680
What are you drinking at the end
of the show?

3255
03:14:41,160 --> 03:14:45,060
John C Dvorak: Well, I got this
from the meetup Lagunitas. Hoppy

3256
03:14:45,060 --> 03:14:49,260
refresher. I have to get up my
game now that somebody made a

3257
03:14:49,260 --> 03:14:53,370
mockery of my commentary. And
this is one of these is a beer

3258
03:14:53,370 --> 03:14:54,750
into show mixes.

3259
03:14:54,990 --> 03:14:57,150
Unknown: This is a beer. No,

Adam Curry: What's the hoppy

3263
03:15:05,790 --> 03:15:07,320
John C Dvorak: Happy refresher.

03:15:08,820 --> 03:15:12,060
Adam Curry: We have endless show

3297
03:17:20,670 --> 03:17:23,640
Adam Curry: doesn't know doesn't

03:17:29,400 --> 03:17:31,230
said I misread it. Okay, got

3300
03:17:31,230 --> 03:17:38,760
Unknown: it gathered in masse
it's a memo that describes how

3301
03:17:38,760 --> 03:17:43,650
we're going to take out seven
countries in five years. Which

3302
03:17:43,650 --> 03:17:44,220

3303
03:17:44,220 --> 03:17:47,250

3304
03:17:47,280 --> 03:17:49,410
John C Dvorak: when I first came
to office one of the first

3305
03:17:49,410 --> 03:17:53,850
meetings I had was at the
Pentagon with generals evil

3306
03:17:53,970 --> 03:17:56,010
minds that blood destruction

3307
03:17:58,080 --> 03:18:01,530
Unknown: Bolton has always said
let's go to war but he's not the

3308
03:18:01,530 --> 03:18:03,990
one who's gonna go on the
forefront. He's a coward

3309
03:18:06,060 --> 03:18:12,600
destined structure. The leaders
of Iran are racketeers behind

3310
03:18:12,630 --> 03:18:20,940
every problem is Iran what you
said 2016 and liked it when you

3311
03:18:20,940 --> 03:18:22,260

You got a roll president in the
White House surrounded by these

3313
03:18:27,600 --> 03:18:31,230
Uber hawks that thirst for
another war with Iran.

3314
03:18:33,150 --> 03:18:37,140
International Atomic Energy
Agency has never found Iran in

03:18:37,140 --> 03:18:39,540
contravention of stipulations in
the deal.

3316
03:18:41,520 --> 03:18:44,760
John C Dvorak: If Iran wants to
find that will be the official

3317
03:18:44,790 --> 03:18:49,350
end of Iran never threaten the
United States. Again, I'm not

3318
03:18:49,470 --> 03:18:52,680
Unknown: somebody that wants to
go into war in the United States
