1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,999
those boys are just gonna get
in the

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,999
trouble the way they think Adam
Curry

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:24,999
John C. Dvorak this is no
agenda and

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,999
from northern Silicon Valley
where I

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,999
have the exact right amount of
clips I

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,999
can explain why later I'm John
C Devorah

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,999
[Music] 

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,999
well I know the feeling when
you wake up

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,999
and everything's there and
you're like

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,999
oh my god have the exact right
amount of

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,999
claps yeah the last show and
now we

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,999
don't play everything but we
came to the

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,999
party with almost 70 clips yeah
we came

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,999
with too many that's quite a
lot of

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,999
quite a lot of clips yes do you
want to

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,999
expand on why it's just the
right amount

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,999
of will that come later yeah
what I've

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,999
did my newest process is I take
the

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,999
clips and I print them on a
sheet on the

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,999
left hand side landscape style

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,999
oh okay and so that leaves a
bunch of

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,999
room on the page usually have
to have

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,999
two sheet for taking notes
writing down

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,999
potential titles things like
this stuff

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,999
yeah yeah and when I folded the
paper in

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,999
half it usually has the clips
or there's

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,999
a lot of little white space
over there

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,999
there was a it's perfect it's
like when

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,999
you fold it in half to create a
you know

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,999
landscape Felipe's piece of
paper fold

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,999
in half the the length of
everything is

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,999
just perfect it fit on the sheet

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,999
perfectly well so this is the
exact

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,999
right amount of clips that is an

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,999
interesting observation I have
something

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,999
very similar I have a window
open and

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,999
it's the clip bin and I tossed
like so I

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,999
have your clips in the morning
that's in

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,999
a folder it's closed but then
when that

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,999
when that bin is filled to the
bottom

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,999
before it starts to scroll
that's my

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,999
sign that I have the ideal
amount of

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:12,999
clips 

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,999
there you go this is everybody
out there

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,999
is fascinating

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,999
inside the podcasters studio
everybody

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,999
without of Korean Jon sliver
egg so

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,999
we're almost well we're on our
road to

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,999
recovery here tomorrow make
Texas in

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,999

Louis about

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,999
time well this through
everybody fairly

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,999
everybody needs a haircut oh do
I ever

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,999
oh man I look scraggly Tina's

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,999
complaining about her about her
roots

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,999
well that's what women do but I

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,999
understand so I immediately
texted my my

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,999
hair gal she's like well
because this

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,999
was Friday yeah Friday so we've
been

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,999
totally blindsided by this we
don't know

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,999
what to do we're not ready they
were I

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,999
think that the the hair
industry was

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,999
kind of kicked back like the
month

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,999
whatever I'm flying goodbye
haircut so I

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,999
guess we should immediately
talk about

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,999
the haircut of the Chicago
mayor which

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,999
she did despite actually telling

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,999
everybody that you shouldn't go
to the

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,999
hair salon he or she is the
whole

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,999
thing's kind of explained in
this clip

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,999
you hadn't heard it yet Mayer
Lightfoot

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,999
facing criticism tonight after
getting

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,999
her hair done a photo surfaced
of the

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,999
mayor with a hairdresser but she

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,999
appeared to ignore social
distancing

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,999
efforts standing right next to
them for

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,999
the picture when asked about
that photo

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,999
today this is what the mayor
had to say

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,999
I'm the public face of this
city I'm on

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,999
national media and I'm out in
the public

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,999
eye and you know I map I'm I'm
a person

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,999
who I take my personal hygiene
very

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,999
seriously as I said I felt like
I needed

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,999
to have a haircut I'm not able
to do

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,999
that myself and so I got a
haircut

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,999
I'm going to talk more about
that part

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,999
of the criticism came from the
fact that

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,999
the mayor had called on people
not to go

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,999
out and get their hair done in
one of

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,999
her stay home save lives PSA so
that

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,999
pissed people off and I kind of
liked

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,999
how she takes her personal
hygiene very

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,999
seriously it's important to her
is it

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,999
personal hygiene really
involved with

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,999
washing your hair as opposed to
getting

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,999
a cut well maybe it was more
than that

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,999
for her did you use the word
hygiene

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,999
personal appearance different
yes what's

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,999
great though and all of this is
in the

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,999
show notes the videos in there
as well

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,999
and it's in a show notes calm
what's

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,999
great to watch is when she's
saying that

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,999
this the the woman who was
signing next

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,999
to her is making these horrible
faces

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,999
you know how they they really
do a lot

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,999
of the expression when they're
signing

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,999
and and they and they mimic
some of the

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,999
words and and she actually was
looking

109
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,999
at the mayor going like
grimacing her

110
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,999
face like I'm a portent it's
something

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,999
that has to be seen it's very
very funny

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,999
once you take your attention off

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,999
Lightfoot herself so in Texas
Governor

114
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,999
Abbott said okay me these the
the broad

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,999
announcements May 8th hair
salons

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,999
barbershops I think nail salons
as well

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,999
on the 18th

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,999
Jim's other types of athletic
places and

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,999
I think on the 18th and
restaurants can

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,999
go to 50% so that's moving
along but oh

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,999
no we can't have that with our
mayor

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,999
adlet here in Austin no no oh
no this is

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:48,999
wrong 

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,999
yeah you know it's a way too
early of

125
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,999
course how could we go back to
the

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,999
Abbott and Abbott specifically
said you

127
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,999
this supersedes everything but
everybody

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,999
here in Austin wants to have
masks on

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,999
outside it's 99 degrees I'm
barely

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,999
surviving let alone some
coronavirus in

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,999
the air it's not happening so
Adler well

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,999
since you can't find you he'll
guilt you

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,999
into wearing a mask clear this
up for me

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,999
are we still required to wear
the masks

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,999
in Austin or did the governor's
order

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,999
supersede that well

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,999
Gunnar's order said that we
weren't

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,999
allowed to have a penalty of a
civil or

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,999
criminal penalty associated
with not

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,999
wearing masks but yet he
recommended me

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,999
whereas the lieutenant governor

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,999
recommended we wear masks every
public

143
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,999
health official that I talked
to says

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,999
people should wear masks

145
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,999
so in Austin in the city I'm
going to

146
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,999
keep it mandatory now the
penalty for

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,999
not wearing a mask is that more
people

148
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,999
are going to be infected and
some people

149
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,999
are going to die so the penalty
is

150
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,999
justice now I'm hoping that
people will

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,999
take this particular penalty
very

152
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,999
seriously we should all still
be wearing

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,999
masks yeah you got me into two
clips I

154
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,999
got a play I wasn't meaning a
blame

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,999
right away about a play okay
both about

156
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,999
masks uh-huh let's start with
Trump in

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,999
Arizona no mask democracy now
big deal

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,999
it's a reopening of our country
who

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,999
would have ever thought we were
going to

160
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,999
be saying that a reopening
reopening

161
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,999
president Trump made the
remarks during

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,999
a trip to Arizona where he
toured a

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,999
Honeywell aerospace plant
that's now

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,999
producing a 95 facemasks Trump
wore

165
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,999
safety glasses but no masks
during the

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:35,999
tour 

167
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,999
ignoring a sign in the factory
ordering

168
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,999
everyone inside to wear facial
covering

169
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,999
as a Honeywell executive showed

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,999
president Trump n95 masks loud
speakers

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,999
blared a cover of the song Live
and Let

172
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,999
Die by the band Guns and Roses

173
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,999
Wow they stoop to this level
this is

174
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,999
this is like face bag level
reporting oh

175
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,999
my god

176
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,999
[Applause] 

177
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,999
Trump also wore no mask during a

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,999
roundtable discussion Tuesday
with

179
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,999
Native American leaders at the
meeting

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,999
Trump promised to send a half
billion

181
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,999
dollars to the Navajo Nation
which has

182
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,999
been devastated by kovat 19
more than a

183
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,999
month after Trump signed the
Kara's Act

184
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,999
into law tribes still haven't
received

185
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,999
some eight billion dollars and
promised

186
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,999
relief funds okay so that where
that

187
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,999
leads me to this wait can I
just make a

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,999
quick observation about this
sure that

189
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,999
is Trump's tape that's the one
he plays

190
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,999
at the rallies that's the one
with tiny

191
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,999
dancer that's the one with an
in fact

192
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,999
right after he was done at the
plant

193
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,999
they played that can't always
get what

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,999
you want and it's not Guns and
Roses

195
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,999
it's wings

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,999
shut up Amy Amy Amy

197
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,999
we got Amy there so this came
up and

198
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,999
this just caught my attention
and

199
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,999
brought me back to the clip we
just

200
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,999
played this is Kaley new
secretary yes

201
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,999
this is good

202
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,999
she's great by the way she is
now she's

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,999
real mean she's a mean girl I
had no I

204
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,999
had my doubts about Kaley
mackaninee I'm

205
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,999
like she's gonna get eaten
alive she

206
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,999
comes out with just tons of
makeup and

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,999
hair also I mean really
hammered on

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,999
thick because she's changes her
entire

209
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,999
appearance it really does she
looks

210
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,999
entirely different and then
yeah I

211
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,999
thought this was a great mic
drop me one

212
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,999
this is the one on masks oh oh
oh the

213
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,999
master one I haven't heard the
mask one

214
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,999
okay what do we got play this
is Kayla

215
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,999
and the politics of mass now
she doesn't

216
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,999
really answer this question but
it

217
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,999
brought up an interesting point
which

218
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,999
relates to the fact that
Austin's all

219
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,999
bent out of shape

220
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,999
Amy's all bent out of shape and
the

221
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,999
question is we do have to
discuss this

222
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,999
but you've I'm sure you've seen
the

223
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,999
number of holes there's a huge

224
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,999
difference between Democrats and

225
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,999
Republicans over whether or not
they

226
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,999
think it's necessary to wear
masks no

227
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,999
sense as to why that would be
that's the

228
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,999
choice to the American public
choice to

229
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,999
the individual as to whether to
wear a

230
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,999
mask or not but again I'd
praise the

231
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,999
extraordinary work of this

232
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,999
administration and distributing
those

233
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,999
masks and ensuring health care
providers

234
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,999
son get them okay so she
doesn't answer

235
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,999
the question but now this guy
did bring

236
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,999
up the point and this point is
reflected

237
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,999
in all the clips you're gonna
get the

238
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,999
Democrats all we gotta wear a
mask we

239
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,999
gotta wear our masks were told
to wear a

240
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,999
mask we have to wear a mask
we're gonna

241
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,999
kill each other they're all
gonna die if

242
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,999
we don't wear a mask yeah the

243
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,999
Republicans are hey I wear a
mask 'its

244
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,999
are somebody around and they
don't worry

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,999
I have to wear a mess I wear a
mask if I

246
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,999
have to wear a mask I'm not
gonna wear a

247
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,999
mask if I don't have to wear a
mask I'm

248
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,999
not gonna wear a mask when I'm
walking

249
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,999
down the street and it's a
political

250
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,999
thing so this whole thing's
become

251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,999
politicized and the mask is D
is the

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,999
kind of this symbol well it was
it was

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,999
ventilators before that now
it's gone

254
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,999
now it's gone to the next level

255
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,999
and I think I know why but I'm

256
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,999
interested to hear your further
thoughts

257
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,999
I don't really have any serious
thoughts

258
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,999
i but I do know that I have a
basic

259
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,999
thought mm-hmm I think the
Democrats are

260
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,999
the Liberals in Canada would be
a good

261
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,999
example they're more compliant
they

262
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,999
fought they're more route
they're

263
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,999
rule-followers they can't think
for

264
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,999
themselves oftentimes I think I
mean I

265
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,999
hate to say it but that just
seems to be

266
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,999
the case and they and their
virtue

267
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,999
signaling and the virtual
signal is a

268
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,999
big part of it all we've got a
mask on

269
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,999
look at me I got a mask on it's
it's the

270
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,999
blotter and people so you don't
have a

271
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,999
mask on you should have a mask
on they

272
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,999
like the lecture people yes
it's all

273
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,999
it's all so go ahead well I
don't have

274
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,999
anything deeper than that's
kind of a

275
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,999
shallow I know it's very
obvious besides

276
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,999
the virtue signal which in fact
shows

277
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,999
other people that you have the
same

278
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,999
irrational thinking at this
moment if

279
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,999
it's outside now if someone has
a

280
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,999
business and they want me to
wear a mask

281
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,999
in their business fine I really
don't

282
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,999
care if I want to get something
if not

283
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,999
if I don't want to do business
with them

284
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,999
I won't but outside no you're
not gonna

285
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,999
shame me in and into any of
this but the

286
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,999
reason for it is also

287
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,999
the symbolism of a muzzle shut
up slave

288
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,999
it's a muslin er yes I like it
and

289
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,999
that's why people who are mad
about the

290
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,999
whole thing really refused to
wear it I

291
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,999
think subconsciously we're like
no I'm

292
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,999
not going to be muzzled by this
that's a

293
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,999
good I like this a lot thank
you now I

294
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,999
will say that Mimi has a mess
that she

295
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,999
had made I think J made it for
which

296
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,999
goes over the nose and mouth
and this is

297
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,999
a break limits when the cloth
vest was

298
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,999
painted and I recommend people
try this

299
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,999
I mean we do have some matching
just buy

300
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,999
from the Zoe she's sniffing
she's

301
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,999
sniffing the paint is she
breathing that

302
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,999
rue this name is not just paint
it it's

303
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,999
got a big red nose and a
stupid-looking

304
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,999
clown smiling too big giant
teeth

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,999
hanging out of it mmm so just
it's the

306
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,999
stupidest looking thing you've
ever I

307
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,999
have to take a picture put it
in the

308
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,999
newsletter I'll wear it it's
it's she

309
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,999
won't wear she's embarrassed by
it but

310
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,999
I'd wear it and it's very funny
and it's

311
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,999
like makes it it really was just

312
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,999
ridicules the whole system since

313
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,999
graduation but just from you
know I

314
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,999
okay I'm biased now because I
think of

315
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,999
it as it's a really as a muzzle
as a I

316
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,999
mean there's so much that goes
along

317
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,999
with the mask yeah but I when
people

318
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,999
come in an opposite direction
for me but

319
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,999
also in Texas I smile you know
now all

320
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,999
you got to work with is your
eyes and I

321
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,999
got a really bad eye today so
people

322
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,999
would always see was a mask in
this

323
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,999
pussy right eye and they'd be
freaked

324
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,999
out but you can have some blood
painted

325
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,999
on your chin like on your neck
like it's

326
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,999
dripping I saw a commercial
yesterday

327
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,999
from dull no sense to clip it
because

328
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,999
it's only text on the screen

329
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,999
masks are worn by superheroes
and they

330
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,999
show of course first responders
and

331
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,999
nurses and doctors there is
there's

332
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,999
another part to it perhaps and
it's it's

333
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,999
purely about the response

334
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,999
an NBC of all of all they
published a

335
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,999
poll of which country scores
best with

336
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,999
their citizens as it pertains
to their

337
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,999
response to the corona virus
outbreak

338
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,999
and if you look at the list and
remember

339
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,999
NBC who do you think is the
number one

340
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,999
country with coronavirus
response

341
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,999
ranking according to well this
global

342
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,999
law survey NBC mate would
probably pick

343
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,999
China yup 86 Vietnam was 77
then we get

344
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,999
UAE India Malaysia New Zealand
Taiwan

345
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,999
Philippines Indonesia Singapore
South

346
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,999
America Australia Germany then
we get

347
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,999
the United States where Sweden
under

348
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,999
this Sweden is of course not on
the list

349
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,999
but that no well that's
interesting

350
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,999
isn't it that brings up
something else

351
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,999
and I do it oh do you want to
get back

352
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,999
to to the opening up stuff
remember

353
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,999
Apple released their data of
how many

354
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,999
times people requested
directions on the

355
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,999
Apple Maps app which a lot of
people

356
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,999
emailed me saying hey man just
because

357
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,999
they're you're publishing that
doesn't

358
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,999
mean that tracking is not your
personal

359
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,999
information it doesn't matter
the

360
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,999
promise was you share nothing
you're

361
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,999
sharing something you're
sharing me

362
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,999
touching my screen I don't like
that but

363
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,999
anyway they publish this data
so I go

364
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,999
and look and you can see it's
really

365
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,999
about mobility so that guests
they say

366
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,999
if you ask for directions you
were going

367
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,999
to travel they claimed they
didn't track

368
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,999
that part in these numbers and
you see

369
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,999
everybody has an L it's the
famous L

370
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,999
drops down goes boo boo
doubloon and

371
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,999
idea it starts to tail up a
little bit

372
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,999
and you can drill down by cunt
like in

373
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,999
the United States you can drill
down by

374
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,999
state go to Sweden there's an L
it's not

375
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,999
true that they didn't do
anything they

376
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,999
definitely had a significant -
fifty

377
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,999
percent in transit activity
they weren't

378
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,999
locked up at home though that's
what

379
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,999
makes it different and people
did it and

380
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,999
I know a lot of companies did
that so

381
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,999
you know I'm we're not out of
the woods

382
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,999
on 

383
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,999
this was a good idea or not
particularly

384
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,999
now that New York has seen 60%
of all

385
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,999
transmissions occurred where in
the home

386
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,999
people at home giving each other

387
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,999
coronavirus so it might not
have been

388
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,999
such a good idea anyway there's
a reason

389
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,999
why and it's gone full-on
political so

390
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,999
I'm not too worried about
coronavirus

391
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,999
anymore I mean yes people will
still die

392
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,999
there will be putt we're doing
a lot of

393
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,999
testing so you see lots of
positives we

394
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,999
have no idea if people are
being marked

395
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,999
up is truly dead from kovat 19
or not

396
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,999
doesn't matter it's B
everything's

397
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,999
politicized now so there's
clearly no

398
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,999
one else in Washington
certainly is

399
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,999
worried about it but we have
all this

400
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,999
this these things coming out
now all of

401
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,999
a sudden we have a report that
was MIT

402
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,999
that wasn't a report it was a
draft

403
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,999
created inside the habit here

404
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,999
it was the Harvard Public
Health Harvard

405
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,999
Bloomberg public school no I'm
saying it

406
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,999
wrong John Hopkins Hopkins
Bloomberg

407
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,999
School of Public Health the
same guys

408
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,999
who did event 201 somehow some
internal

409
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,999
document from one guy who's
himself says

410
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,999
in the Washington Post he has
no idea

411
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,999
how that draft model which was
not by

412
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,999
any means done or ready for
publication

413
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,999
or even the model wasn't
completed how

414
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,999
that got leaked to the
Washington Post

415
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,999
he doesn't understand this the
mutant

416
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,999
strain memo no no this is this
is the

417
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,999
model that Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg to

418
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,999
the Washington Post that says
the true

419
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,999
deaths will be 200,000 in the
United

420
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,999
States by the end of June so
everyone

421
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,999
started freaking out and it was
all

422
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,999
that's all it was Monday and
all that

423
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,999
everyone's going nuts they're
like oh we

424
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,999
can't open up and stop
protesting and

425
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,999
Jake Tapper does I mean leading
the

426
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,999
witness 

427
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,999
has Michigan Governor Whitmer
who of

428
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,999
course had huge protests she's
very

429
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,999
unpopular she's been doing all
kind of

430
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,999
crazy things telling people
they can't

431
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,999
buy certain things and stores
has to be

432
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,999
roped off but just it's nuts

433
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,999
so Jake Tapper wants her to
describe the

434
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,999
citizens who came to protest
outside of

435
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,999
I guess the state the state
capitol

436
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,999
ordered her man the governor's
mansion

437
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,999
but listen to how he frames the
question

438
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,999
is disgusting these protests
came after

439
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,999
President Trump tweeted liberate

440
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,999
Michigan he tweeted quote the
governor

441
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,999
of Michigan should give a
little put out

442
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,999
the fire he said that these are
very

443
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,999
good people about the
protesters that

444
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,999
were featured in the video to
which the

445
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,999
executive director of the Jewish

446
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,999
Democratic Council of America
Haley so

447
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,999
far who's from Lansing Michigan
she

448
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,999
compared those comments to
president

449
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,999
Trump referring to those
marching

450
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,999
alongside neo-nazis in
Charlottesville

451
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,999
as very fine people is that how
you see

452
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,999
these protesters in that vein
and that

453
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,999
extreme can you believe that
question

454
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,999
that guy is the debt is the
douchiest

455
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,999
question you could possibly ask
and

456
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,999
here's her answer and he knows
that the

457
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,999
debt very fine people thing
relating it

458
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,999
to Charlotte is just pathetic

459
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,999
that's exactly what he was
going for

460
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,999
phil has very fine people don't
tell me

461
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,999
is that isn't that come on come
on

462
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,999
Whitmer is that how you see
these people

463
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,999
don't you think in that extreme
well

464
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,999
some of the outrageousness of
what

465
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,999
happened at our Capitol this
week you

466
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,999
know depicted some of the worst
racism

467
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,999
and awful parts of our history
in this

468
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,999
country sure the Confederate
flags and

469
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,999
nooses the swastikas the you
know

470
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,999
behavior that you've seen in
all of the

471
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,999
clips is not representative of
who we

472
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,999
are no I didn't see any nooses
and

473
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,999
swastikas please show me
evidence of

474
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,999
this horrible it's just
horrible there's

475
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,999
any swastikas it would have
been a

476
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,999
reference to her exactly no
serious yes

477
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:45,999
I 

478
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,999
but this is exactly what the
Nazis did

479
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,999
they locked everybody up took
away their

480
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,999
livelihood bankrupted the small
the

481
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,999
small businesses now maybe
they're just

482
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,999
using a couple of tactics but
yeah so

483
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,999
anyway back to that to the
bogut of

484
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,999
report it was so bad that
secretary of

485
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,999
human health and services a
czar had to

486
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,999
come on fox and friends go into
the

487
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,999
friendly trenches to disclaim
it which i

488
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,999
think he did a really poor job
of yeah

489
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,999
mr. secretary the other question

490
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,999
obviously this morning and many

491
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,999
Americans are waking up and
wondering

492
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,999
about is are these various news
reports

493
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,999
suggesting there's at least a
draft

494
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,999
report from CDC FEMA officials
and

495
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,999
others predicting that you and
others in

496
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,999
the White House the
administration have

497
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,999
to prepare for the possibility
of up to

498
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,999
two hundred thousand deaths of
Americans

499
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,999
by June 1st that there's going
to be

500
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,999
3,000 deaths a day it's going
to be

501
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,999
rising is that true have you
seen such a

502
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,999
report and if it's not true
what are you

503
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,999
preparing for sir so I've not
seen that

504
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,999
report I've heard about it
obviously

505
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,999
this is there are hundreds of
models

506
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,999
that are it was in The
Washington Post I

507
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,999
find that to be an insufficient
answer I

508
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,999
haven't seen it yet dude it was
the

509
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,999
front page of The Washington
Post

510
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,999
bad answer so I think it was

511
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,999
refrigerated hasn't seen that
literally

512
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,999
have the reported as hands I
know but it

513
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,999
just like it comes across as
weak you

514
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,999
know it didn't didn't bother
you that

515
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,999
the way minute I didn't hear
anything

516
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,999
negative about that don't let
him finish

517
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,999
so I've not seen that report
I've heard

518
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,999
about it obviously this is
there are

519
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,999
hundreds of models that are
drafted up

520
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,999
to look at various
contingencies out in

521
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,999
the private public health world
as well

522
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,999
as within our agencies this
apparently

523
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,999
is a draft modeling report of
various

524
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,999
contingencies prepared by Johns
Hopkins

525
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,999
this was not reviewed by the
White House

526
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,999
or senior leadership or the
Task Force

527
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,999
the president's recommendations
on

528
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,999
reopening the American economy
are based

529
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,999
on the soundest scientific
evidence and

530
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,999
modeling and forecasting not
draft

531
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,999
initial projections that just
are

532
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,999
floating out there see what the
problem

533
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,999
I have with this is that

534
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,999
I don't understand how any
citizen this

535
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,999
is probably the same around the
world

536
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,999
with these experts and and the
and the

537
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,999
leaders of these different
departments

538
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,999
it's very difficult for me to
follow

539
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,999
what the numbers are and what
the model

540
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,999
is and it's okay if you change
it but

541
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,999
stick to one and say here's
them don't

542
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,999
tell me there's all kinds of
models

543
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,999
floating out there that we may
pick from

544
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,999
this one or that one I don't
want to

545
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,999
hear that what are the numbers

546
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,999
why does CDC have different
kovat 19

547
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,999
deaths versus the so-called
67,000 I

548
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,999
don't even know where to find
those

549
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,999
numbers anymore that chart has
just been

550
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,999
given away it's bullcrap you're
all full

551
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,999
of crap when it comes to these
models

552
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,999
no obviously to add insult to
add insult

553
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,999
to this Neil Ferguson the man
behind the

554
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,999
original we're all gonna die
two million

555
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,999
deaths in America model the man

556
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,999
responsible for millions of
cattle being

557
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,999
unnecessarily killed during
Hooven mouth

558
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,999
disease who was wrong every
single time

559
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,999
by a factor 10 on all of the
crises but

560
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,999
still we used his model Neil
Ferguson

561
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,999
resigned from the advisory
group because

562
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,999
he broke the lockdown rules in
the UK

563
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,999
because he knows his bullcrap
it's

564
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,999
unbelievable you know I broke
the

565
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,999
lockdown rules right yeah
because he had

566
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,999
a date with his his tinder
girlfriend I

567
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,999
know it makes it that's very
British of

568
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,999
course you know if it's a
scandal it's

569
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,999
always about his penis oh we're
good at

570
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,999
that here too but what's nicer
the work

571
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,999
that has been done
independently is a

572
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,999
code review of Ferguson's model
as you

573
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,999
recall this model the 2-million
model

574
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,999
later revised to 200,000 to
80,000 to

575
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,999
60,000 now apparently revised
back up

576
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,999
who knows what was created using

577
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,999
thirteen-year-old undocumented
code so

578
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,999
the lockdown skeptics which is
a group

579
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,999
you can find at I think it's
locked

580
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,999
locked locked down skeptics
calm just

581
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,999
check 

582
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,999
org they did a code review a

583
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,999
professional code review of
what they

584
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,999
could and this is such a piece
of crap

585
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,999
they can't even run it on a
multi-core

586
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,999
process you have to run it in
single

587
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,999
thread mode otherwise it
doesn't work

588
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,999
with the same inputs outputs
are not

589
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,999
repeatable or Purdue or
reproducible no

590
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,999
regression testing after
changes the

591
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,999
whole thing makes no sense

592
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,999
it's very poorly developed and
you can

593
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,999
read it for yourself I mean
anything I

594
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,999
say will go too deep for most
and I'll

595
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,999
just sound foolish but these
guys seem

596
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,999
like they're pretty Pro and
then the one

597
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,999
thing I can do is I can look up
a word

598
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,999
it says because they this group
went

599
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,999
back and forth with the
Imperial College

600
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,999
reviewing the software and they
said

601
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,999
well you know it's really
intended to

602
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,999
often provide as very
stochastic results

603
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,999
like what is stochastic do you
know have

604
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,999
you heard of the word

605
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,999
kostik yeah it's a very it's
used all

606
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,999
the time in computer science
randomly

607
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,999
determined so the results are
randomly

608
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,999
determined they say it right in
black

609
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,999
and white you have to remember
it Bill

610
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,999
Gates is behind this I'm not
sure what

611
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,999
it means but okay mr. coder
luckily dr.

612
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,999
Drew is is still on the scene
we know he

613
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,999
is on foul she sphere squad but
he still

614
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,999
has his own opinion and one of
our

615
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,999
producers handed over three
short clips

616
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,999
worth listening to the first
one regards

617
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,999
outdoor transmission of the
virus dr.

618
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:01,999
drew 

619
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,999
research has shown there's been
only one

620
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,999
documented case that was in
China of

621
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,999
outdoor transmission all other
cases

622
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,999
have been indoor transmission
which is

623
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,999
interesting there's also good
evidence

624
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,999
that the virus dies very
quickly out in

625
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,999
sunlight so outdoor looks like
a safe

626
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,999
place for us to be but we
shouldn't be

627
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,999
outdoors without masks and we
shouldn't

628
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,999
be outdoors
shoulder-to-shoulder so then

629
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,999
that seems stupid to be doing
that and

630
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,999
that seems silly to me

631
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,999
uh-huh thank you very much masks

632
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,999
outdoors everybody don't walk

633
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,999
shoulder-to-shoulder tell us
about

634
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,999
shutting down drew what kind of

635
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,999
experience do you have with
that what is

636
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,999
this all based on does it
really work is

637
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,999
it the way to go I mean it
seems like

638
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,999
everyone got infected at home
the idea

639
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,999
of shutting everybody down is a
new idea

640
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,999
that was developed in the 2006
Bush

641
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,999
administration provisional plan
on

642
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,999
pandemics based on a high-school

643
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,999
students science project so the
idea

644
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,999
that this is the way to go
shutting

645
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,999
everything down is is not true
it's not

646
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,999
scientifically true it may be
superior

647
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,999
but we don't know yet

648
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,999
so it may just be that when we
go back

649
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,999
to masks and social distancing
in the

650
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,999
world 

651
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,999
there will be no uptick in the
cases so

652
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,999
this idea of a second wave may
never

653
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,999
happen that we will have some
uptick

654
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,999
some little outbreaks but the
idea will

655
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,999
be to isolate and contain those

656
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,999
outbreaks 

657
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,999
okay there you go never been
proven

658
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,999
never been tested I'm kind of
interested

659
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,999
you know as we move into the
next phase

660
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,999
of tracking and tracing we're
supposed

661
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,999
to learn things from that and I
have not

662
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,999
seen one report about South
Korea if

663
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,999
they've learned anything I
would have

664
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,999
expected some kind of
information coming

665
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,999
back by now but we continue
with dr.

666
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,999
drew final clip here about
social

667
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,999
distancing that one's nervous
because

668
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,999
people are beginning to pile
out of

669
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,999
their their isolation but you
gotta

670
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,999
remember we don't know that
isolation is

671
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,999
superior to social distancing
we don't

672
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,999
know that now isolation
certainly

673
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,999
superior to nothing but they've
never

674
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,999
studied the difference between
social

675
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,999
distancing and masks done
properly and

676
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,999
quarantine never been done so
we will

677
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,999
find out soon enough

678
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,999
[Music] 

679
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,999
well I want to go back to what
you were

680
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,999
talking about with these models
okay

681
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,999
there seems to be a this is Chi
I don't

682
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,999
know when it changed or how it
changed

683
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,999
and I'd have a sense it has
something to

684
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,999
do with the way they're gonna
keep us on

685
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,999
the global warming tract yeah
that well

686
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,999
that's got to come but we have
to keep

687
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,999
all focused on impeaching Trump
with

688
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,999
more important to get impious
of course

689
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,999
but if you remember the last I
think

690
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,999
it's probably the last three or
maybe

691
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,999
even the last four or five
hurricanes

692
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,999
when they showed the the
predictions

693
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,999
nowadays they don't just show a

694
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,999
prediction they used to always
do that

695
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,999
the news guys would rather guy
here's

696
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,999
what's predicted to do know now
they

697
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,999
show about 30 tracks and they
show them

698
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,999
on the screen on the weather
screen they

699
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,999
sir that could do this it could
do that

700
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,999
it could yes mighty says it's
gonna do

701
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,999
that yeah the Western alliance
of

702
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,999
weather caster says he's gonna
do this

703
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,999
and they have all these
different

704
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,999
companies that's what that's
what the

705
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,999
one where Trump took one of the
things

706
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,999
that's gotta hit in Atlanta
right

707
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,999
remember that model that was
the Sharpie

708
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,999
model and so you have all these
models

709
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,999
now and they're scrolling
around all

710
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,999
over the map it's there's a
couple of

711
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,999
things that says to me one is
that this

712
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,999
has changed we've never seen
anything

713
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,999
like this before and they could
have

714
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,999
been doing this for a long time
but they

715
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,999
haven't they just started
recently it's

716
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,999
because and I think global
warming's got

717
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,999
something to do with it because
there's

718
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,999
a lot of models and and they
don't

719
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,999
nobody wants to talk about the
Russian

720
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,999
model which we've talked about
an

721
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,999
emphasize which seems seems to
be

722
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,999
tracking are very mild increase
in

723
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,999
temperatures and this is got
nothing to

724
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,999
do with much of anything but
they're

725
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,999
getting to the point where
they're gonna

726
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,999
do this because they can did
now there's

727
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,999
no responsibility right well
that was

728
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,999
one of the models yeah

729
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,999
well that was one of the most
well

730
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,999
that's not them yeah well there
was 30

731
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,999
models and gray this is the one
that

732
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,999
happened there's always the the
model

733
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,999
always works as the is the
least complex

734
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,999
when it's a simple one but they
it's

735
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,999
just solving themselves have any

736
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,999
responsibilities are the models
models

737
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,999
well along with social
distancing has

738
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,999
come something new which is also

739
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,999
excepted and that social
censorship and

740
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,999
I just coined that myself I
don't know

741
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,999
if anyone ever thought of it
but that's

742
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,999
really what we're witnessing
where there

743
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,999
is a social agreement

744
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,999
apparently that certain types of

745
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,999
information should be censored
because

746
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,999
it's very dangerous in in our
current

747
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,999
climate because we need to
listen to the

748
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,999
experts with their multiple
models this

749
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,999
is why David Icke has been
completely

750
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,999
removed over an interview in
where and

751
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,999
I've watched it I've watched
all of his

752
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,999
interviews and clips from it
well let's

753
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,999
go through that and I'll just
preface

754
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,999
this by saying what Google and
YouTube

755
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,999
and I think Spotify Spotify
removed the

756
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,999
David Icke podcast

757
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,999
Oh boohoo this thank God we
made that

758
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,999
shit open people you really
think you

759
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,999
can you can silence people by
kicking

760
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,999
them off Spotify and it looks
really

761
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,999
dumb Spotify but they're all
making the

762
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,999
AOL mistake America Online was
safe

763
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,999
you're safe with us well we'll
give you

764
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,999
this little window with a
crappy browser

765
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,999
to that scary Internet but you
really

766
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,999
don't want to go there stay
with us use

767
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,999
a keyword that's what they're
trying to

768
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,999
do is trying to keep people
safe and it

769
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,999
doesn't work people want to go
out they

770
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,999
want a bit they want to find
out crazy

771
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,999
stuff they need alternative
information

772
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,999
so they're going to leave these

773
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,999
platforms anyway social
censorship

774
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,999
that's in full play like yeah
like your

775
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,999
little theory there like that
may even

776
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,999
be a show title I'll flip over
this

777
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,999
perfectly folded sheet and
write it down

778
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,999
oh it's the shownotes side of
the page

779
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,999

780
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,999
let's go over some of this I
only have

781
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,999

interesting but

782
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,999
then I have another only have
two clips

783
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,999
so we're not gonna bore people
stuff

784
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,999
with David Icke but David Ickes
whole

785
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,999
thing he goes on and on for
about an

786
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,999
hour but it would everything we
talked

787
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,999
about on this show yeah pretty
much it's

788
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,999
not it's nothing new or even I
mean it's

789
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,999
interesting on the show but we
talked

790
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,999
about in the show months ago
and it's so

791
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,999
it's kind of like oh geez David

and then he does his little
crazy stuff

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,999
with this five Gina the five G
thing is

796
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,999
also misinterpreted he never
says to

797
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,999
everyone like because there was

798
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,999
something that went around

00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,999
g's gonna trigger the corona
it's out

800
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,999

G is is

802
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,999
going to make people sick and
Corona

803
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,999
coincidentally can be used as
the excuse

804
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,999
oh they're sick because of
Corona not

805
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,999
because of 5g but I'll play
this clip

806
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,999
this is david icke of comm
story 5g a

807
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,999
government sensor called Ofcom
Office of

808
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,999
Communications 

809
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,999
which is the regulator of
British

810
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,999
broadcasters they have said and
it's

811
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,999
it's run by a lady called
Melanie doors

812
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,999
and we need to note these names
down

813
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,999
ladies and gentlemen and when
we're

814
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,999
through this at some at some
level

815
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,999
through it these people have to
be

816
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,999
called to account we have a
situation

817
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,999
where this lady and her
organization

818
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,999
which is a government
department has

819
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,999
told British broadcasters and
of course

820
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,999
they've complied spineless ly
as usual

821
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,999
that they will face serious
sanctions if

822
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,999
they allow any discussion on
their

823
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,999
television stations and radio
stations

824
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,999
about any connection between 5g
and

825
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,999
so-called copied 19 the British

826
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,999
government through this other
idiot the

827
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,999
health secretary Matt Hancock
you know

828
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,999
people are sitting there all

829
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,999
house is 66 million people in
this

830
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,999
country oh shit near me else in
doing as

831
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,999
I'm told

832
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,999
because this this guy you you
wouldn't

833
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,999
let run a you know a Lego house
Hancock

834
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,999
he's saying that everyone must
do that I

835
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,999
mean what are we doing anyway

836
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,999
people like him are now saying
to the

837
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,999
the Giants of Silicon Valley
years aku

838
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,999
Berg's at Facebook your Bryn's
and pages

839
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,999
at Google and you know which
house keys

840
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,999
at Google owned YouTube etc
that they

841
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,999
should ban people who are
making a

842
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,999
connection between Phi

843
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,999
gee and this co bid nineteen
crisis so

844
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,999
that tells you one they
couldn't care

845
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,999
less about freedom and the
right to free

846
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,999
debate thus they have no right
to be in

847
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,999
government and no right to be
running a

848
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,999
broadcast regulator but he told
you

849
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,999
something else

850
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,999
number two it tells you there
is a link

851
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,999
between Phi G and this health
crisis

852
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,999
there's only one reason they
don't want

853
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,999
it discussed because there is a
link and

854
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,999
who's been promoting Phi G and
the

855
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,999
rollout of Phi G who runs the
licenses

856
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,999
for Phi G Ofcom same woman in a

857
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,999
different interview he went a
little bit

858
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,999
more in depth than ID and I
looked up

859
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,999
the studies and what he claims
and the

860
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,999
claim is correct I don't know
if it is

861
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,999
true for five G depending on the

862
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,999
frequencies power etc but
indeed effects

863
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,999
of electromagnetic field
exposure can

864
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,999
create oxidative stress and acts

865
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,999
antioxidant defense system
issues and I

866
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,999
he talked about it in this one
to go to

867
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:21,999
this one

868
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,999
and said it's completely valid
that and

869
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,999
and the thing with these
theories which

870
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,999
is always with Ike it's always
the case

871
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,999
if you listen to what doctors
are saying

872
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,999
people are turning blue it's
like

873
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,999
they're not getting enough
oxygen I

874
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,999
think we had a clip of that ER
doctor in

875
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,999
New York who said to me it
looked like

876
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,999
someone was at you know 20,000
feet

877
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,999
without oxygen and they were
just

878
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,999
literally dying because of a
lack of

879
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,999
oxygen in their lungs and in
their blood

880
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,999
and so that could be that
absolutely if

881
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,999
someone's immune system is
compromised

882
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,999
and there's a 5g tower next
door and

883
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,999
possibly I don't know but it's
certainly

884
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,999
he I don't think he ever said

885
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,999
coronavirus is caused by 5g but
it

886
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,999
doesn't matter no he never says
that it

887
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,999
doesn't matter its social
censorship if

888
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,999
it if it deviates at all it
must be

889
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,999
eliminated yes I'm I'm I'm gall
wood

890
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,999
this is why our show existed

891
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,999
of course let's play the let's
play the

892
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,999
other one which is DVID I get
left there

893
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,999
sorry this is this is an
interesting

894
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,999
clip because I hate gives me an
anecdote

895
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,999
I can I can talk about this
David Icke

896
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,999
towers going up while this
lockdown has

897
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,999
been going on I know from
communications

898
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,999
to to me and Gaz and Jamie at
some David

899
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,999
Wright comm I know from all the
postings

900
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,999
on the Internet not just in
Britain but

901
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,999
around the world in America but
while

902
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,999
this lockdown has been going on
5g masts

903
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,999
are being rolled out at a very
rapid

904
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,999
rate in the same period of this
lockdown

905
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,999
something like another 21 towns
and

906
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,999
cities have been opened in
Britain - 5 g

907
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,999
a5 G is being rolled out all
over the

908
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,999
world at a very great rate of
knots this

909
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,999
is a time where everything is
supposed

910
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,999
to be stopped yeah and they're
still

911
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,999
building towers overnight yes
because

912
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,999
that's considered yeah yeah we
okay so I

913
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,999
saw one row up here right like
five

914
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,999
minutes from our house I was
like what

915
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,999
that's new well Mimi drove down
from

916
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,999
Washington last I guess Monday
but no

917
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,999
but maybe you last Friday I'm
not read

918
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,999
one of these days before it's
been

919
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,999
around because traffic is just
there's

920
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,999
no traffic and go back before
it yeah so

921
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,999
she comes down this last time
and she

922
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,999
says holy crap all I saw coming
down

923
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,999
were people putting up 5g
towers yeah

924
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,999
all along a highway us
interstate 5 yeah

925
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,999
well and you know when you
think about

926
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,999
it and they are of course
essential

927
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,999
personnel this is
infrastructure it's a

928
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,999
great time from the do anything
what

929
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,999
they should be doing is fixing
the

930
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,999
potholes that's what I've been
waiting

931
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,999
for 

932
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,999
oh yeah no pothole fixing
whatsoever

933
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,999
see that that would have
endeared the

934
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,999
community but no but no but no
but no so

935
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,999
so Ike effectively really D
platformed

936
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,999
it just and you're right that's
that's

937
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,999
why our show is here and we're

938
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,999
completely independent and
thank God we

939
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,999
don't have to rely on a youtube
or

940
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,999
anything else like that and in
that and

941
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,999
I gotta say bitch shoot some of
these

942
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,999
you know be that all these
different

943
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,999
alternative video sites they're
that

944
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,999
they're winning with this
they're

945
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,999
gaining well we'll see what if
this is a

946
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,999
good strategy for them but I
think that

947
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,999
when you it's one thing to have
your

948
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,999
people you know to socially
censor

949
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,999
content on your platforms when
people

950
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,999
are running their regular lives
but when

951
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,999
they're at home all day you
know they

952
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,999
start to wander then they're not

953
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,999
entirely your slaves anymore
they're

954
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,999
thinking for themselves maybe a
little

955
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,999
bit so not one but the point is
you

956
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,999
can't start taking this stuff
down I

957
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,999
mean what's that they're just
you're

958
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,999
gonna hurt you two-bit long
term of

959
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,999
course you can't get
advertisers anyway

960
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,999
but if the Russian car cam
videos moved

961
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,999
to a separate platform boom and
once the

962
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,999
cats are gone after that the
cats

963
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,999
changed so that once the cats
leave then

964
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,999
you got no platform left cats
and car

965
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,999
crashes is that's the end funny
moment

966
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,999
in West Virginia although it's
kind of a

967
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,999
blue dress silver dress moment
the

968
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,999
governor of West Virginia
accused of an

969
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,999
expletive again I encourage all

970
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,999
businesses that are allowed to
open to

971
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,999
do so only if they fucking
follow the

972
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,999
guidelines to keep West
Virginians safe

973
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,999
now he claims he didn't use an
expletive

974
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,999
today at her news briefing
there was an

975
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,999
audio glitch and it sounded
like that I

976
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,999
had said a bad word a word that
I was I

977
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,999
would never say nor have I ever
said no

978
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,999
possibility in any way shape
form or

979
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,999
fashion okay yeah

980
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,999
bullcrap but I there is a
glitch and

981
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,999
that and you're allowed to say
that when

982
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,999
it comes to audio there is an
actual

983
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,999
glitch in that but it's after
the F word

984
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,999
and I can't make anything
outside of it

985
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,999
I don't know when then what was
he

986
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,999
saying if it wasn't

987
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,999
I'll listen to it one more time
again I

988
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,999
encourage all businesses that
are

989
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,999
allowed to open to do so only
if they

990
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,999
fucking follow the guidelines
to keep

991
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,999
West Virginia safe I don't know
at least

992
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,999
it gave us another five minutes
of

993
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,999
entertainment you know this
denial he

994
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,999
should just apologize for
saying it I

995
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,999
think so too I just looked up I
mean

996
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,999
this is the kind of thing I got
yeah

997
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:11,999
yeah let's move over to
pharmaceutical

998
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,999
stuff and the President did
eight it was

999
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,999
a virtual town hall of the
Lincoln

1000
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,999
Memorial this was a Fox
exclusive very

1001
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,999
interesting setting I'm not
quite like

1002
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,999
what are you trying to say here
hmm I

1003
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,999
wonder 

1004
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,999
Trump Lincoln and you trying to
connect

1005
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,999
something here in my brain and
he took

1006
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,999
questions and you also took
questions

1007
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,999
from Martha and from Brett and
the

1008
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,999
question came up about the

1009
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,999
pharmaceutical companies and
the need

1010
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,999
for them to be really you know
we need

1011
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,999
our medications our essential

1012
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,999
medications created in the
United States

1013
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,999
maybe not in China or other
countries

1014
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,999
and so it was kind of a
two-parter in

1015
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,999
the second part I think she
rattles the

1016
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,999
president a bit and here's his
part one

1017
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,999
there's a lot of people who say
why you

1018
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,999
talk about making it here in
America

1019
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,999
why are all of the antibiotics
made in

1020
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,999
China can you give me a date by
which we

1021
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,999
will be self-sufficient in
antibiotics

1022
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,999
in this country and what kind of

1023
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,999
incentive would you give
manufacturers

1024
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,999
of pharmaceuticals to make sure
that we

1025
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,999
are not dependent on China
anymore for

1026
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,999
this so the reason it took
place is

1027
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,999
because other people that sat
in this

1028
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,999
chair maybe not right here but
this is a

1029
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,999
beautiful place because they
were

1030
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,999
foolish you could even say
because they

1031
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,999
were stupid because they
allowed this to

1032
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,999
happen and it's not only China
you take

1033
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,999
a look at Ireland they make our
drugs

1034
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,999
everybody makes our drugs
except us and

1035
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,999
we've already done it what

1036
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,999
coming out with things numbers
you're

1037
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,999
seeing numbers of innovations
that we've

1038
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,999
made in the past and things are
being

1039
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,999
announced already but we're
bringing

1040
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,999
that whole supply chain back
nobody has

1041
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,999
to tell me to do it I've been
talking

1042
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,999
about that for years now the
one that

1043
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,999
you see you don't see you see
it with

1044
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,999
cars you see it with other
things people

1045
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,999
never looked at medicine but
it's always

1046
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,999
been about medicine because we
have at

1047
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,999
least 94 95 percent of our
medicines are

1048
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,999
made important to do the
vaccine watch

1049
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,999
an incredible thing there
American

1050
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,999
companies well I'd like to be
able to do

1051
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,999
it here I don't want to do it
in China

1052
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,999
don't want the vaccine in China
that's

1053
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,999
for sure but then Martha
follows up and

1054
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,999
I want you to give me your
impression

1055
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,999
after you listen to the clip
whether

1056
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,999
this was a setup whether he
knew it was

1057
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,999
coming if if he turned it
around and may

1058
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,999
turn it into something to his
advantage

1059
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,999
I think we need to talk through
it

1060
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,999
because she presses him and she
uses

1061
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,999
something and that's why I'm
suspicious

1062
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,999
of the question well when will
we get to

1063
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,999
that 95 percent everything made
here and

1064
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,999
he seemed rattled when we get
94 percent

1065
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,999
of antibiotics made in this
country do

1066
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:55,999
you have a target date for that
I think

1067
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,999
we will have it done within two
years

1068
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,999
you know it doesn't go that
quickly and

1069
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,999
frankly you put me in a very bad

1070
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,999
negotiating position by asking
me those

1071
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,999
questions you know we're
talking about

1072
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,999
this now I'm supposed to call
up my guys

1073
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,999
I mean you put me in a very bad

1074
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,999
negotiating position and I'm
not blaming

1075
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,999
you that's you that's your job
you know

1076
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,999
you're taking my cards away
because I

1077
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,999
don't want to be talking this
way I've

1078
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,999
done a lot but it gets exposed
when you

1079
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,999
answer I assume the show is a
big show

1080
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,999
right it's going to do very
well tonight

1081
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,999
but you do take away a lot of
my cards

1082
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,999
when you're answering asking me
a

1083
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,999
question like that you
understand that

1084
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,999
yes here's the bottom line I
met with a

1085
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,999
drug company six months ago I
said you

1086
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,999
got to stop making the drugs
here

1087
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,999
you're gonna start making them
here and

1088
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,999
they do it for two reasons

1089
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,999
a cost reason but it's no
longer so much

1090
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,999
cost because we can do things
here for

1091
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,999
the same price and in some
cases less

1092
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,999
and then you don't have the

1093
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,999
transportation problems we're
taking

1094
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,999
care of our look another reason
I got

1095
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,999
elected and some people don't
like the

1096
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,999
sound of it and other countries
don't

1097
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,999
like it but I said I'm sorry
it's called

1098
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,999
America first and we're all
about

1099
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,999
America first that's what we're
about

1100
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,999
it was protest protesting a bit
much I

1101
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,999
felt he's got a tell which is
he which

1102
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,999
is the term that we're always
ridiculing

1103
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,999
people for doing it he doesn't
normally

1104
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,999
do it but when he does it I
believe this

1105
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,999
is when he says look yeah yeah
exactly

1106
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,999
yeah so he said look I met with
the with

1107
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,999
the pharma guys six months ago
so I've

1108
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,999
been telling them you got to
bring it

1109
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,999
back and I'm sure that you know
similar

1110
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,999
to what has happened in the
past they're

1111
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,999
waiting for something to
sweeten the

1112
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,999
deal and that's why I think he
protests

1113
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,999
too much I think it this was
maybe the

1114
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,999
whole thing was part of his
negotiating

1115
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,999
it could be I haven't figured
it out

1116
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,999
what could be cuz he did you
know oh no

1117
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:06,999
you're gonna ruin I only have
one other

1118
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,999
question from this but it's a
good one

1119
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,999
and his answer was very
complete and

1120
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,999
this comes on the heels of at
least the

1121
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,999
knowledge being out there
according to

1122
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,999
The Spectator in Australia that
there is

1123
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,999
a five eyes intelligence report
so

1124
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,999
that's the UK the United States
Canada

1125
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,999
Australia and New Zealand that
Australia

1126
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,999
has and there's a 15-page is
floating

1127
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,999
out and about let's say you
know hey

1128
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,999
yeah the Chinese are really
responsible

1129
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,999
for this and we don't know
exactly how

1130
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,999
much is true or how deep it
goes but

1131
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,999
Trump has a very outspoken
opinion on

1132
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,999
this and he got a question
about it from

1133
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,999
some dude who called in it was
black guy

1134
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,999
and he he looked and he well he
sounds

1135
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,999
as stoned as he looked mr.
president I

1136
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,999
have a question for you is
there enough

1137
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,999
evidence that China made a
global

1138
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,999
community of by the scorn of our

1139
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,999
if it's so hot your global
community

1140
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,999
respond yeah well I don't lose
any

1141
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,999
question about it we wanted to
go in

1142
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,999
they didn't want us to go in
early very

1143
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,999
early you'll see that because
things are

1144
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,999
coming out that are pretty
compelling

1145
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,999
now so I don't think there's any

1146
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,999
question don't forget China
tried to

1147
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,999
blame it first on some of our
soldiers

1148
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,999
that turned out did not go too
far I'm

1149
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,999
sorry I do need to mention I
have edited

1150
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,999
this clip in two spots because
Trump

1151
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,999
I've learned speaks and what I
call

1152
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,999
hanging chads so he'll talk
he'll be

1153
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,999
he'll be talking about
something then

1154
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,999
all sudden he drops down into a

1155
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,999
repetitive sentence about how
he looks

1156
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,999
oh and I closed it up on time
and they

1157
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,999
told me not to and then they
closed it

1158
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,999
and then he comes back to the
stores

1159
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,999
like this is like one of his
rallies

1160
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,999
yeah so it's a hanging Chad
thing so I

1161
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,999
just snipped it off and I
really got

1162
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,999
very upset with that that was
not right

1163
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,999
China tried to blame Europe for
this no

1164
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,999
I know you saw evidence that
gave you a

1165
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,999
high confidence that the virus
came from

1166
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,999
the Wuhan lab we got that it
was created

1167
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:07,999
there perhaps but that it came
from

1168
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,999
there at the right day we can
illuminate

1169
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,999
any more about that yeah we're
gonna be

1170
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,999
giving a very strong report as
to

1171
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,999
exactly what we think happened
and I

1172
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,999
think it'll be very conclusive
is there

1173
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:19,999
any suggestion that it was
anything

1174
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,999
nefarious or that it was just a
mistake

1175
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,999
so I think they made personally
I think

1176
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,999
they made a horrible mistake
and they

1177
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,999
didn't want to admit it we
wanted to go

1178
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,999
in they didn't want us there
even world

1179
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,999
health wanted to go in they were

1180
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,999
admitted but much later you
know not

1181
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,999
immediately and my opinion is
they made

1182
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,999
a mistake they tried to cover
it they

1183
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,999
tried to put it out it's like a
fire you

1184
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,999
know it's really like trying to
put out

1185
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,999
a fire they couldn't put out
the fire

1186
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,999
what they really treated the
world badly

1187
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,999
on they stopped people going
into China

1188
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,999
but they didn't stop people
going into

1189
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,999
the USA and all over the world
so you

1190
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,999
could fly out of Wuhan where
the primary

1191
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,999
problem was all of the problem

1192
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,999
essentially also where the lab
is

1193
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,999
but you could fly out of war on
and you

1194
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,999
could go to different parts of
the world

1195
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,999
but you couldn't go to Beijing
and you

1196
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,999
couldn't go to any place in
China so

1197
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,999
what's that all about

1198
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,999
in other words they

1199
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,999
they had a problem I think they
were

1200
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,999
embarrassed by the problem very

1201
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,999
embarrassed and you know the
case could

1202
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,999
be made they said hey look this
is gonna

1203
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,999
have a huge impact on China but
here's

1204
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,999
the thing they allowed this to
go into

1205
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,999
our country they allowed it to
go into

1206
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,999
other countries they change how
you feel

1207
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,999
about president G does it
change your

1208
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,999
relationship with him I'm not
going to

1209
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,999
say anything I had a very good

1210
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,999
relationship he's a strong man
he's a

1211
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,999
tough man and a very good
relationship

1212
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,999
with him but this should never
have

1213
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:43,999
happened 

1214
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,999
this should never have happened
this

1215
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,999
virus should not have spread
all over

1216
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,999
the world they should have put
it out

1217
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,999
they should have let us and
other people

1218
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,999
in other countries go in and
put it out

1219
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,999
because people knew what was
happening

1220
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,999
so that is a pretty clear
opinion and a

1221
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,999
lot of people heard it and saw
it I

1222
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,999
think it was almost four
million people

1223
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,999
who viewed that Town Hall which
was huge

1224
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,999
for Fox News on cable I was
very big for

1225
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,999
them yeah why well Pompeo made
some

1226
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,999
comments about this which took
a very

1227
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,999
strange 

1228
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,999
turn because it sounds like he
was

1229
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,999
contradicting himself and so I
have this

1230
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,999
clip of him answering the wuhan
origin

1231
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,999
question 200 in a press
conference and

1232
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,999
mr said you seen anything that
gives you

1233
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,999
high confidence that it
originated in

1234
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,999
that Wuhan lab Martha there's
enormous

1235
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,999
evidence that that's where this
began

1236
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,999
we've said from the beginning
that this

1237
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,999
was a virus that originated in
Wuhan

1238
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,999
China we took a lot of grief
for that

1239
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,999
from the outset but I think the
whole

1240
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,999
world can see now remember
China has a

1241
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,999
history of infecting the world
and they

1242
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,999
have a history of running
substandard

1243
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,999
laboratories these are not the
first

1244
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,999
times that we've had a world
exposed to

1245
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,999
viruses as a result of failures
in the

1246
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,999
Chinese lab and so while the

1247
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,999
intelligence community
continues to do

1248
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,999
its work they should continue
to do that

1249
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,999
and verify so that we are
certain I can

1250
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:04,999
tell you that there is a
significant

1251
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,999
amount of evidence that this
came from

1252
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,999
that laboratory in one do you
believe it

1253
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,999
was man-made or genetically
modified

1254
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,999
that the best experts so far
seem to

1255
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,999
think it was man-made have no
reason to

1256
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,999
disbelieve that at this point
your

1257
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,999
office of the DNI says the
consensus the

1258
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,999
scientific consensus was not
man-made or

1259
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,999
genetically modified that's
right I I

1260
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:29,999
agree with that yeah

1261
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,999
obviously I've seen their
analysis I've

1262
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,999
seen the summary that you saw
that was

1263
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,999
released publicly I have no
reason to

1264
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,999
doubt that that is accurate
okay so just

1265
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,999
to be clear you do not think it
was

1266
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,999
man-made or genetically
modified I've

1267
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,999
seen what the intelligence
committee has

1268
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,999
said I have no reason to
believe that

1269
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,999
they've got it wrong you have
to put

1270
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,999
this in context here I think
that

1271
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,999
there's confusion in the
question and

1272
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,999
the answer and when he's saying
when

1273
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,999
she's asking about if it was
created so

1274
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,999
clearly wasn't synthetic but in
his mind

1275
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,999
I believe he's answering the
question if

1276
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,999
it's a bio weapon

1277
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,999
No No if you listen to this very

1278
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,999
carefully at the very end the
very end

1279
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,999
of that clip he says you got to
take

1280
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,999
this in context he says I
believe what

1281
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,999
the DNI said but you got to
take it in

1282
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,999
context that's what he said and
what he

1283
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,999
and I do i imaginated over this

1284
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,999
particular clip for a while
before I

1285
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,999
realized what context meant the
DNI

1286
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,999
report stated that the a bunch
of

1287
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,999
scientists and other people
agreed that

1288
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,999
it was all was a natural form
element

1289
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,999
and it was and in that that was
the

1290
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,999
reports about the agreement was
solid

1291
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,999
that it was naturally formed it
came out

1292
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,999
of no bad or whatever and in
context

1293
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,999
what he was saying why he could
agree

1294
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,999
with the DNI report is that
they were

1295
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,999
reporting on what the
scientists said

1296
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,999
reporting on the reality of it
okay okay

1297
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,999
right and that's what he meant
by you

1298
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,999
gotta take this in context well
the

1299
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,999
context was the DNI was not
discussing

1300
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,999
how this virus came about or
there's

1301
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,999
other probably other
intelligence

1302
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,999
reports that came out that
indicate

1303
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,999
because he's very strong that
this is

1304
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,999
man-made genetically engineered
or

1305
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,999
whatever from the lab that made
words

1306
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,999
escaped from which brings me
back to

1307
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,999
what I think that would the
French guy

1308
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,999
the guy who had discovered the
AIDS

1309
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:26,999
virus 

1310
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,999
said and I'm gonna subscribe
her to him

1311
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,999
even though it was says he's
nuts he's

1312
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,999
nuts What did he say so so I
listened

1313
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,999
this over and over again I
realized that

1314
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,999
you could yes you can't say
that it was

1315
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,999
man-made and you can agree with
the DNI

1316
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,999
report because the DNI report
is just

1317
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,999
stating that all these
scientists have

1318
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,999
said the following yes I agree
that the

1319
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,999
DNI reports got that right those

1320
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,999
scientists did say that well
that makes

1321
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,999
sense because the last thing he
wants to

1322
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,999
do is supersede because the
president

1323
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,999
also didn't say man-made he
said come

1324
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,999
from he didn't get into that so
they

1325
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:08,999
Pompeii yeah yeah well not it
not a

1326
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,999
great replicating into any have
any

1327
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,999
trouble agreeing with the DNI
report

1328
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,999
which 

1329
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,999
it wasn't it was I don't think
it was

1330
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,999
well done no but I think it'd
be but

1331
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,999
when he says in context that
was the key

1332
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,999
work I got yeah so anyways like
I think

1333
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:25,999
he's not lying

1334
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,999
no but it's confused the
reporters and

1335
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,999
he never really got it went out
of his

1336
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,999
way to explain it I'm not
helpful not

1337
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,999
help it's not helpful

1338
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,999
the Chinese hear it loud and
clear

1339
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,999
though especially when it comes
that

1340
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,999
five eyes report this is from
60 minutes

1341
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,999
in Australia how's this for
slap this

1342
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,999
week Australia was described as
chewing

1343
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,999
gum on the boot of China that
needed to

1344
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,999
be scraped off on a rock the
insult came

1345
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,999
from an influential Chinese
newspaper

1346
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,999
editor backed by the Communist
Party our

1347
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,999
crime we're troublemakers
because our

1348
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,999
government is calling for an
independent

1349
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,999
inquiry into the origins and
spread of

1350
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,999
coronavirus it's fair to say our

1351
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,999
relationship with Beijing is
currently

1352
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,999
fractured but understanding why
China is

1353
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,999
so defensive

1354
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,999
not to mention petulant is
difficult

1355
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,999
because the regime is so
suspicious of

1356
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,999
the Western media chewing gum
huh stuck

1357
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,999
to the shoe that's gotta stood
that is

1358
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,999
not that's not gonna play well
that's

1359
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,999
international words of war my
friend you

1360
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,999
can't just say that is great
especially

1361
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,999
in context of Eastern culture
and

1362
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,999
chewing gum like chewing gum is
really

1363
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,999
low low on the polls so there's
there

1364
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,999
isn't an attack on China
there's a

1365
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,999
there's polls everywhere saying

1366
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,999
overwhelming majority of
people's and

1367
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,999
here's the term here's the term
we

1368
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,999
should be on the lookout for D
couple we

1369
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,999
want to consciously decouple
from China

1370
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,999
think this is going to be the
term

1371
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,999
decoupling yeah that's been
that's not

1372
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,999
it that spin I'd say around for
a couple

1373
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,999
months it doesn't go yeah I'm
hearing it

1374
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,999
I'm hearing it it's a good term
it is

1375
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,999
maybe it's catching on here's
what you

1376
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,999
think yeah it could be catching
on

1377
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,999
uncoupled tuples Ted Cruz is on
his own

1378
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,999
little mission

1379
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,999
he's doing the rounds and he
wants to

1380
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,999
force Hollywood to stand up to
Chinese

1381
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,999
censorship and at first I was
kind of

1382
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,999
puzzled like why are you so
interested

1383
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,999
in this it gives a crap but
then I

1384
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,999
realized what he's really doing
he's

1385
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,999
saying we can't have these
movies which

1386
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,999
have a permanent desk at the
Pentagon

1387
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,999
using our military equipment ie
Top Gun

1388
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,999
if they're also going to if
these

1389
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,999
productions are also going to be

1390
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,999
involved in censorship and in
Top Gear's

1391
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,999
spit upon specific instance Tom
Cruise's

1392
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,999
flight jacket had a Taiwanese
flag it

1393
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,999
had to be removed

1394
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,999
so for some reason Ted Cruz is
spending

1395
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,999
a lot of time on that and I
think that

1396
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,999
it may it's it's meant to
cripple China

1397
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,999
in in multiple ways but I think
they do

1398
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,999
have such huge investments in
in movies

1399
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,999
and Hollywood that he's trying
to hurt

1400
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,999
them there but it's just an odd
thing to

1401
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,999
do it's like even more to it
than that

1402
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,999
what you got

1403
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,999
he knows the connection I don't
know I'm

1404
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,999
not a mind reader I don't know
what Ted

1405
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,999
Cruz is thinking he may have
nefarious

1406
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,999
scheme under foot under way
mm-hmm maybe

1407
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,999
under foot he said something
offensive

1408
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,999
too right now we're trying to
get Taiwan

1409
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:53,999
to get involved into

1410
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,999
whu-oh and some other things
would we're

1411
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,999
moving to get Taiwan's
independence

1412
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,999
recognized I mean there's a
million

1413
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:01,999
things that we've been trying
to do at

1414
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,999
Taiwan for ever since the 1940s
right

1415
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,999
when they you know ran off and
you know

1416
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,999
the government really Republic
of China

1417
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,999
ran off and to become the
Republic of

1418
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,999
China on Taiwan they run off to
off the

1419
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,999
mainland by Mao and so there's
there's

1420
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,999
that element and so this any
pushback by

1421
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,999
the Chinese on stuff like that
little

1422
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,999
flag is going to be rejected but

1423
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,999
especially when yeah the
Chinese invest

1424
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,999
a lot of money how much money
do you

1425
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:31,999
think the State Department or
the

1426
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,999
Defense Department spends on
one of

1427
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,999
these war movies in terms of

1428
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,999
just fuel for the Jets and I
think oh

1429
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,999
yeah that's a lot of money it's
Millions

1430
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,999
yeah and so why are we you know
taking a

1431
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,999
backseat to the Chinese
investment when

1432
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,999
we're making these investments
and these

1433
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,999
movies actually can't be done
without an

1434
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,999
investment I agree I'm just
kind of

1435
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,999
confused as to why Ted Cruz is
in this

1436
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,999
but maybe it maybe he's trying
to create

1437
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,999
a squeeze and and he's really
going

1438
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,999
after Hollywood and not China

1439
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,999
I think it's possible he's
going after

1440
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,999
Hollywood yeah that's what that
that

1441
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,999
would make more sense I would
make more

1442
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:17,999
sense so meanwhile we have on
the

1443
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,999
medical front we have multiple
trials

1444
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,999
going we know REM dis aveer is
is now in

1445
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,999
trial which have all these all
these

1446
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,999
great stats it's all in the
show notes

1447
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,999
you know the cost of REM dis
severe it's

1448
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,999
like it's like $400 a day versus

1449
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,999
hydroxychloroquine at the
pennies a day

1450
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,999
it's really quite an incredible
and it

1451
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,999
just seems like anything that
is not

1452
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,999
approved by doctor dr. death
himself

1453
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,999
doctor foul Qi that it has to
be pushed

1454
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,999
back in them and quiet and be
suppressed

1455
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,999
let's not talk about it and
then all of

1456
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,999
a sudden we get this over the
over the

1457
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,999
past few days out of Pittsburgh
Ross

1458
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,999
Township police believe two men
found

1459
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,999
shot to death over the weekend
was a

1460
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,999
murder-suicide 

1461
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,999
the body of 37 year old being
Lou was

1462
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,999
found Saturday at his home at
the muse

1463
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,999
of town north

1464
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,999
police believe loose killer
left the

1465
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,999
town home went back to his car
and

1466
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,999
killed himself that man has not
been

1467
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:19,999
identified but police say they
believe

1468
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,999
that Lou and the man did know
each other

1469
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,999
well so this research have been
research

1470
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,999
have been working on a cure a
treatment

1471
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,999
for kovat 19 any and he goes
out in a

1472
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,999
murder-suicide what are the
chances but

1473
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,999
that brings us to the planned
Demick

1474
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,999
quote-unquote documentary that
has been

1475
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,999
socially censored they're still

1476
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,999
available on multiple platforms
have you

1477
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,999
seen this John's about 20
seconds woman

1478
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,999
has lots of videos that have
come and

1479
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:56,999
gone they all get censored I
always

1480
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,999
download them mm-hmm very
copies very

1481
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,999
good cuz I figure you know this
things

1482
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,999
aren't gonna last and this
latest one

1483
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,999
though I have to say the one
with the

1484
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,999
ominous opening and the guy
interviewing

1485
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,999
uh yeah I think it's the best
produce

1486
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,999
and the and the most impactful
cuz this

1487
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,999
the one mimi's all you got to
watch this

1488
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,999
yes yes and I said well you
know I'm

1489
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:17,999
very familiar with this woman
and she's

1490
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,999
been bitching and moaning about
one

1491
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,999
thing or another for a long
time long

1492
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,999
time long time well we we
actually

1493
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,999
discussed her probably about
ten by

1494
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,999
decade a decade ago but we just
started

1495
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,999
the show now I'll just want to
say this

1496
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,999
about the documentary I did not
pull any

1497
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,999
clips from that because it's
great as a

1498
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,999
piece and I think it's
fantastic to make

1499
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,999
people aware of of this story
and of end

1500
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,999
of this doctor story in
particular but

1501
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:50,999
you know you get all the scary
music

1502
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,999
it's very dressed and there's a
lot of

1503
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,999
manipulation going on so I
found an

1504
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,999
interview that she did with it
was just

1505
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,999
her a Skype call but the the
quality is

1506
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,999
good and the questions she
speaks in in

1507
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,999
answer blocks she's fantastic
for media

1508
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,999
but we knew about her when we
first

1509
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,999
started talking about vaccines
on this

1510
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,999
show 10 11 years ago I'll just
be

1511
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,999
somewhat repetitive that we had
found

1512
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,999
documentation from a big
Goldman Sachs

1513
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,999
and JP Morgan Chase I think
medical

1514
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,999
conference that all the
pharmaceutical

1515
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,999
companies were all jacked up
because

1516
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,999
vaccines was the future it's a
you know

1517
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,999
in some cases they're mandatory
so it's

1518
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,999
a guaranteed paycheck and
they're

1519
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:32,999
identified they're indemnified
they

1520
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,999
don't have to go to the same
test ii

1521
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,999
because it's called the
biologic and

1522
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,999
there's so many great reasons
for this

1523
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,999
and we got a lot of contact
which i

1524
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,999
don't think I quite understood
at the

1525
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,999
time about dr. Mike Ovitz as it
pertains

1526
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,999
to chronic fatigue syndrome and
people

1527
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,999
were trying to communicate
something to

1528
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:53,999
us and we dice or

1529
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,999
was just not my headspace was
not there

1530
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:57,999
we just kind of started
deconstructing

1531
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,999
stuff and I was a little naive
to some

1532
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:02,999
things that were going on so it
comes to

1533
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,999
the medical community but in
this first

1534
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,999
clip she addresses that and
what she had

1535
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,999
figured out back in the day is
that

1536
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,999
there were what are called XM
RVs which

1537
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,999
is Mouse raira viral viral
retrovirals

1538
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,999
excuse me extra cross were
showing up in

1539
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,999
in different people and for
reasons that

1540
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,999
were very unclear but what this
was

1541
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,999
creating was a chronic fatigue
syndrome

1542
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,999
not dissimilar to HIV actually
in many

1543
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,999
ways in fact the and we'll get
to that

1544
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,999
later testing for HIV showed
people with

1545
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,999
these xmrv zyi this chronic
fatigue

1546
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,999
syndrome show tested positive
for HIV

1547
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,999
even though I didn't have HIV
so it's a

1548
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,999
mess and she was a part of it
she's been

1549
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,999
part of fout she's system for
many years

1550
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,999
and she has her own story about
how she

1551
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,999
was kicked out and and jailed
and

1552
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,999
accused of fraud and and that
certainly

1553
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:13,999
stuff you can look into I'm more

1554
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,999
interested in what she's saying
she

1555
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,999
sounds credible she certainly
has the

1556
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,999
curriculum to back her up and
let's take

1557
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,999
go back to that initial issue
when we

1558
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,999
were first introduced to her
but this is

1559
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:25,999
a current interview

1560
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,999
this is dr. Judy Michael it's
Mike Ovitz

1561
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,999
we we isolated a new family of

1562
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,999
retroviruses called XMRV that
means Zeno

1563
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,999
trophic Mouse related
retrovirus so it

1564
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,999
was very clear that you know
the human

1565
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,999
by room doesn't have Mouse
retroviruses

1566
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,999
therefore we thought perhaps as
in the

1567
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,999
days of HIV that this virus
could have

1568
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,999
been spread through biological
therapies

1569
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,999
because we use a lot of mice in
therapy

1570
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,999
in our lab we also remembered
back to

1571
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:07,999
the days of HIV

1572
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,999
when when HIV spread through the

1573
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,999
population from a contaminated
blood

1574
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,999
supply when it became clear by
the way

1575
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,999
that very bit there Alex Jones
has been

1576
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,999
yelling about that for for
maybe 20

1577
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,999
years vaccines being
transporting

1578
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,999
contaminated blood and that's
where he

1579
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,999
got it from spread through the

1580
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,999
population from a contaminated
blood

1581
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,999
supply when it became clear in
2010 and

1582
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,999
11 that in fact the blood
supply was

1583
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,999
heavily contaminated and in
fact the

1584
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,999
most likely way that these
mouse viruses

1585
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,999
of many strains not just one
got into

1586
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,999
humans it was almost certainly
from

1587
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,999
biological therapies and the
most likely

1588
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,999
the most prominent one was
vaccine that

1589
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,999
that in fact that we were
injecting in

1590
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:04,999
mouse tissue

1591
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,999
you know hisses pieces into
into immune

1592
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,999
incompetent little babies
people and and

1593
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,999
we had actually literally
caused a

1594
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,999
number of diseases including
this is a

1595
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,999
this is a family of mouse
cancer-causing

1596
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,999
viruses so cancers and neuro
immune

1597
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,999
diseases including chronic
fatigue

1598
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,999
syndrome autism anomaly Lou
Gehrig's

1599
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,999
disease others are associated
with with

1600
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,999
retroviruses and it was very
clear in

1601
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,999
2011 in the summer of 2011 this
wasn't

1602
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,999
just one but many and and the
most

1603
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,999
likely way they got into humans
was a

1604
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:49,999
contaminated blood supply and

1605
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,999
contaminated vaccines so
contaminated

1606
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,999
vaccines as some so any stories
you've

1607
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,999
heard in the past likely stem
from her

1608
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,999
because that's where I remember
it from

1609
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,999
and that's where that chronic
fatigue

1610
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,999
syndrome came from but there we
did have

1611
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,999
lots of clips if you recall
during the

1612
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:14,999
swine flu bullcrap mm-hmm there
was a

1613
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,999
contaminant there was a

1614
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,999
huge set of vaccines that went
out that

1615
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,999
had live swine flu in him and
would have

1616
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,999
contained would have given
people swine

1617
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,999
flu you know to push the
numbers up I

1618
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,999
don't know I mean it seems like
you know

1619
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,999
the carelessness was weird and
there was

1620
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,999
some cross-contamination of
other

1621
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:38,999
vaccines that nothing to do
with swine

1622
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,999
flu but the swine flu was in
there and

1623
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,999
these were caught at the border
kind of

1624
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,999
azor being shipped out but dude
you

1625
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,999
don't know it because there's
this or

1626
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,999
not there indemnified from any
damages

1627
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,999
no matter what's in the shot
they give

1628
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,999
you anything could be in there
that's

1629
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,999
why I think a lot of people are
I I for

1630
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,999
example do give I got a vaccine
for I

1631
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,999
got the Prevnar 13 back so you
know a

1632
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,999
couple months back yeah before
a kovat

1633
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:06,999
broke out because I figure well
you know

1634
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,999
let's get I because my doctor
said I

1635
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,999
should get it and everybody
said you

1636
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:11,999
should get this if you're
getting older

1637
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,999
you want to get this and this
is the flu

1638
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:14,999
vaccine 

1639
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,999
notice the Prevnar 13 it stops
13

1640
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,999
different kinds of pneumonia
hmm and but

1641
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,999
but at the same time I'm very
dubious

1642
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,999
about any of these things
because

1643
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:28,999
there's now something going
right

1644
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,999
because there was a new of
experimental

1645
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,999
pneumonia vaccine that floated
around I

1646
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:34,999
got a bunch of people sick even
though

1647
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,999
this is well established so I
wasn't too

1648
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,999
worried about it was very
expensive so I

1649
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:40,999
wasn't you know I said well
they're not

1650
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,999
they've got me how many people
are gonna

1651
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,999
be spending this much money for
this

1652
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,999
vaccine and but I'm always
skeptical I'm

1653
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,999
very nd if you look at the
stuff that

1654
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,999
Robert Kennedy jr. said about
the Gates

1655
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,999
Foundation bills experiments on
babies

1656
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:56,999
and they're all in Africa and
India I

1657
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,999
mean most of his vaccine
experiments

1658
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,999
have gone south you're not
gonna like

1659
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,999
this a couple weeks ago we
discussed the

1660
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,999
study that was a published
account the

1661
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:13,999
Medical Journal published
account it's

1662
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,999
in the show notes once again
that a

1663
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,999
number of

1664
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,999
military personnel who the
2017-2018 flu

1665
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,999
vaccination was tested on from
that test

1666
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,999
group that turned out that you
those who

1667
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,999
had been administered the
2017-2018

1668
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,999
season seasonal flu vaccine had
a 36%

1669
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,999
chance 

1670
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,999
higher chance of contracting a

1671
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,999
respiratory disease from some
other

1672
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,999
virus specifically corona virus
do you

1673
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,999
remember that that report they
do

1674
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,999
remember that okay and it's
called it's

1675
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,999
called whether there's a term
for it

1676
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,999
it's like interference I think
it's a

1677
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,999
vaccination interference it's
mentioned

1678
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,999
in this clip because this is
where it

1679
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,999
gets pretty messed up

1680
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,999
as this is the crux of what dr.
Mike

1681
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,999
Ovitz is really saying is going
on with

1682
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,999
kovat 19 what dr. pouchy has
been saying

1683
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,999
is get the influenza vaccines
the live

1684
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,999
attenuated influenza vaccines
and and

1685
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,999
there have been several
publications but

1686
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,999
one in 2017 at 18 among the
military

1687
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,999
which actually said the flu
vaccine

1688
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,999
promotes the spread that is
your 36

1689
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,999
percent more likely to get Koba
19 or an

1690
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,999
infection with SARS code two if
you get

1691
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,999
the influenza vaccine so it is
advice to

1692
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,999
the country you know is totally
against

1693
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,999
published literature that says
it's

1694
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,999
dangerous that yet that you
don't you

1695
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,999
know that you're driving the
disease

1696
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,999
with the influenza vaccine and
that

1697
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,999
would spread it easier to them
across

1698
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,999
nations because those know that
you shed

1699
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,999
those viruses that is you
express those

1700
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,999
viruses and you'll actually you
know can

1701
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,999
get an influenza the same kind
of

1702
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,999
symptoms the same kind of upper

1703
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,999
respiratory infection and now
you're

1704
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:31,999
more like

1705
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,999
li to to spread from human to
human

1706
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,999
the coronaviruses and in fact
other

1707
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,999
microbial agents other viruses

1708
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,999
respiratory syncytial virus
rhinoviruses

1709
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,999
that that cause upper
respiratory

1710
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,999
diseases including influenza
and what

1711
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,999
she's saying here is if you had
the flu

1712
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,999
shot in 2017-18 and possibly
with any

1713
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,999
flu shot or with any
vaccination which

1714
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,999
may have some contamination in
it that

1715
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,999
seems to be prevalent but in
what

1716
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,999
there's evidence that the
actual flu

1717
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,999
shot could make you very
susceptible to

1718
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,999
this and she explains how this
works

1719
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,999
because it sounds very familiar
and even

1720
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,999
worse the vaccines for

1721
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,999
covin 19 the vaccine that would
target

1722
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,999
directly SARS Cove 2 has been
studied

1723
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,999
some since the original SARS
outbreak in

1724
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,999
the original MERS which is
Middle East

1725
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,999
respiratory syndrome outbreak
since that

1726
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,999
time the vaccine development
has gone on

1727
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,999
and in every case and in every
study

1728
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,999
there the vaccine actually
drives the

1729
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,999
death by by literally turning
on the

1730
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,999
fire they you know exploding
the fire of

1731
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,999
the immune the overreaction of
the

1732
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:49,999
immune system

1733
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,999
that is what we call the
signature of

1734
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,999
disease it's that inflammatory
cytokine

1735
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,999
storm and and the vaccine
itself can

1736
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,999
drive that storm such that it
if you are

1737
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:07,999
reexpose it can lead to rapid
death yeah

1738
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,999
by the way as I'd listened to
that clip

1739
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,999
I'm reminding us I didn't
record it but

1740
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,999
they're talking about actually
I do have

1741
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,999
a clip they see if I can find
it it's

1742
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,999
the clip that says because I was

1743
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,999
watching this clip as they were
doing it

1744
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,999
this is the not the source of
mutants I

1745
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,999
wanted to get unto that but
mystery cord

1746
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,999
allowance can't find it
instantly but

1747
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,999
it's they show that they're
working on a

1748
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,999
dr. Britax dr. bright ignored
maybe no

1749
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,999
no they're working it no that's
an all

1750
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,999
right they're working on a
vaccine

1751
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,999
and they did their showing they
say

1752
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,999
human testing has begun I don't
wish I

1753
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:51,999
had this on here

1754
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,999
human testing has begun and
they show

1755
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,999
some poor poor schlub shot of
something

1756
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,999
human just go goodnight damn
thinking

1757
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,999
what maniac is signing up for
this have

1758
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,999
you ever even listening
alternative

1759
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,999
media I'm serious I'm like
screaming at

1760
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,999
this guy screaming at the
television so

1761
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,999
that kills the kill shot from
from dr.

1762
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,999
Mike Ovitz and then you know at
least

1763
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,999
you know what's going on but I
think she

1764
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,999
puts a lot of reputation on the
line

1765
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,999
here for whatever she has left
he's

1766
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,999
written several books about
this about

1767
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,999
this topic and how she was and
it has a

1768
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,999
lot to do with money and
patents and and

1769
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,999
this this cabal of foul Chi and
Burkes

1770
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,999
lieutenant commander Colonel
Burks

1771
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,999
ambassador and Redfield from
the CDC

1772
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,999
these and and bright all these
guys have

1773
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,999
been are been around with Gates

1774
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,999
Foundation I mean it's great to
see

1775
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,999
pictures of pouchy and Burks
without and

1776
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,999
John at the AIDS gala I mean
they they

1777
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,999
these are celebreties they are
very big

1778
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,999
in their world but along the
way we've

1779
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,999
seen or as the doctor will
Chronicle

1780
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:02,999
there's been a lot of cover-ups
and

1781
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,999
lying to push agendas and get
things

1782
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,999
that don't work to work so
people can

1783
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,999
make money there's a published
study

1784
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,999
from 2005 about the effectivity

1785
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,999
the efficacy of
hydroxychloroquine that

1786
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,999
a foul she is a he he's aware
of these

1787
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,999
studies it's his own its own
group of

1788
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:22,999
the government that's done
these yet

1789
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,999
when it comes to this
particular illness

1790
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,999
no no no it's now it's just
anecdotal

1791
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,999
evidence I believe they did
some fudging

1792
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,999
on the numbers or change some
the the

1793
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,999
test goals to push the remedy
severe

1794
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,999
through and of course
ultimately it's

1795
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,999
all to really have nothing that
works

1796
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,999
well in the people's mind then
the

1797
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,999
vaccine which is inevitable the
push is

1798
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,999
real but she feels that doctor
foul she

1799
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,999
should go to jail do you think
that

1800
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,999
doctor thought she played a
part in

1801
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,999
kovat 19 then you

1802
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,999
think that he should be held
accountable

1803
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,999
or responsible or criminally
responsible

1804
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,999
for the corruption with covet
19 or even

1805
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,999
tracing back as far as 30-plus
years oh

1806
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,999
absolutely 

1807
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,999
he should be held criminally
responsible

1808
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,999
all the way back to the spread
of

1809
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,999
hiv/aids through the country at
the same

1810
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,999
time he did the same thing he's
doing

1811
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,999
now in koban 19 that is prevent
the use

1812
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,999
of therapies like
hydroxychloroquine or

1813
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,999
type 1 low dose type 1
interferon alpha

1814
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,999
or any number of natural things
prevent

1815
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,999
people you know from doing the

1816
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,999
appropriate testing the FDA
didn't do

1817
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,999
the appropriate serology
testing that

1818
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,999
that would have shown that in
fact we

1819
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,999
know the virus had been through
this

1820
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,999
country earlier than thought
and we may

1821
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,999
have actually had in many
places a

1822
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,999
natural herd immunity that
isn't it

1823
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,999
occurring with the lockdown and
that

1824
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,999
people aren't being who are
being

1825
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,999
prevented from you know even if
they

1826
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,999
were exposed from from getting
the

1827
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,999
disease with prophylactic
measures

1828
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,999
that's preventative measures
like

1829
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,999
hydroxychloroquine and and all
the same

1830
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,999
time promoting drug use in
research in

1831
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,999
clinical trials which he's also
doing a

1832
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,999
similar thing to what he did on
what he

1833
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,999
directed to be done in the case
of the

1834
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,999
XM rvs that's that's fraudulent
studies

1835
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,999
that that show you know that
that a drug

1836
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,999
works when it really doesn't
work and

1837
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,999
how they manipulate the study
design and

1838
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,999
in order to you know to drag it
out so

1839
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,999
and and then because we're not

1840
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,999
developing a natural herd
immunity the

1841
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,999
the amount of disease and death
that's

1842
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,999
being caused while while people
are well

1843
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,999
he's promoting measures that
that not

1844
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,999
only don't work but it cause
literally

1845
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,999
the devastation of our economy
and and

1846
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,999
and we won't even be able to
count the

1847
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,999
number of deaths from people who

1848
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,999
couldn't get adequate care for
things

1849
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,999
like cancer and and and
cardiovascular

1850
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,999
disease just simple care for

1851
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,999
things that have nothing to do
with Koba

bitching and moaning about
using oxy

1867
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,999
chloroquine and chloroquine
which nobody

1868
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,999

01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,999
emerges as dr. bright Gary oxy

1872
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,999
chloroquine and chloroquine he
just

1873
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,999
decided he could no longer
remain silent

1874
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,999
learn bright has agreed to
testify on

1875
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,999
Capitol Hill next week and he
hopes to

1876
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,999
get his old job back tonight an
HHS

1877
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,999
official says that he was
transferred to

1878
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,999
a critical role at NIH and they
are

1879
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,999
disappointed he hasn't shown up
for work

1880
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,999
which I'm gonna call him that
because

1881
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,999
the following clip this clip is
this the

1882
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,999
doctor burse under dr. bright
ignored

1883
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,999
his term democracy now - just
kind of

1884
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,999
set it up this is a Darrell
course all

1885
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,999
in because this guy was wrong
we let's

1886
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,999
start with this premise he's a

1887
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,999
government worker not
necessarily the

1888
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:47,999
best known in this field for
anything

1889
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,999
he's just the guy is running
this one

1890
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,999
this very small branch of some
very

1891
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,999
small branch of another
division and he

1892
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,999
is what I've seen these guys
I've worked

1893
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:57,999
in the government long enough
to run

1894
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,999
into guys like this everybody
in that

1895
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:01,999
governments are running
cover-your-ass

1896
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,999
memos and they're just that's
what you

1897
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,999
do you do just in case and so
this guy

1898
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,999
is just really a nudnik out of
the blue

1899
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,999
there's nobody's ever heard of
him until

1900
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,999
this he's made this big fuss
and now

1901
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,999
they're gonna bring him in for
so he can

1902
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,999
testify against Trump basically
even

1903
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:21,999
though Trump doesn't know
really what's

1904
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,999
going on I don't think well
let's play

1905
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:24,999
this clip and I yeah i'll tell
you

1906
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:25,999
what's goal

1907
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,999
me about this and instead to
award

1908
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,999
lucrative contracts based on
political

1909
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,999
connections in other words I was

1910
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,999
pressured to left politics and
cronyism

1911
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,999
drive decisions over the
opinions of the

1912
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,999
best scientists we have in
government

1913
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,999
dr. bright also says he
repeatedly and

1914
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,999
urgently demanded action in
January to

1915
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,999
address the looming pandemic
including a

1916
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,999
critical shortage of personal
protective

1917
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,999
equipment for doctors like n95
face

1918
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,999
masks but was ignored it was
ignored

1919
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,999
because he's like most people
in the

1920
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,999
government you're ignored
because

1921
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,999
everybody's bitching and
moaning about

1922
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,999
one thing or the other so this
guy going

1923
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,999
on I was ignored that was
ignored that's

1924
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,999
what he's gonna testify against
I wrote

1925
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,999
a memo on January 5th saying we
don't

1926
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:14,999
have enough and why would he
even have

1927
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,999
anything to do with n95 face
max the

1928
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:18,999
stats how many there are what
the

1929
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,999
hospitals have it doesn't make
any sense

1930
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,999
but okay I was ignored I wrote
this man

1931
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,999
when I was ignore all you wrote
this

1932
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,999
memo was and you were ignored
nobody

1933
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,999
said anything yo well my boss
has told

1934
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,999
me to stop writing memos it's
just

1935
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,999
ridiculous this guy and they're
gonna

1936
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:33,999
make a mountain out of a
molehill as

1937
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,999
best they can try to impeach
Trump again

1938
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,999
the end and so the theory is
because

1939
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,999
this guy wrote a memo which was
ignored

1940
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,999
thousands died is that it and
that's the

1941
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:41,999
idea 

1942
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,999
blood on your hands yes exactly

1943
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,999
just briefly on the testing you
know

1944
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,999
testings ramping up so and and
I am

1945
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,999
still surprised how many people
are so

1946
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,999
poorly informed that they read
in the in

1947
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,999
our local news here at Austin
oh we have

1948
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,999
you know 60 new cases oh my god
there's

1949
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,999
a stay in sight no no listen
we're

1950
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,999
testing more and it's good news
the more

1951
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,999
people who are asymptomatic aliy

1952
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,999
infected the lower the actual
chance you

1953
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,999
have of dying you had have more

1954
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,999
information but the tests are a
problem

1955
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,999
and I think one of the one of
the main

1956
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,999
points of David Ickes theory is
that the

1957
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,999
test is for a just a corona
virus but

1958
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,999
not necessarily the kovat 19
creating

1959
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,999
corona virus

1960
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,999
and we know from dr. Mike Ovitz
that

1961
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,999
there were positive tests on
people who

1962
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,999
had they were supposed to have
had AIDS

1963
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,999
which they didn't they had
these excess

1964
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,999
XMRV virus mouse crap in your
in your

1965
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,999
veins but the tests are a real
issue

1966
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,999
this is only a report you I'm
sure you

1967
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,999
won't get this on the mainstream

1968
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,999
you won't from Reuters so take
that for

1969
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,999
what you will coronavirus test
kits used

1970
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,999
in Tanzania were dismissed as
faulty by

1971
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,999
President John Magoo Magoo Fuli
on

1972
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,999
Sunday he said they had returned

1973
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,999
positive samples and he is a
chemist by

1974
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,999
the way that's why he ordered
it so they

1975
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,999
had received positive samples
positive

1976
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,999
results on samples taken from a
goat and

1977
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,999
from a pawpaw which is a fruit

1978
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,999
so both the goat and the pawpaw
tested

1979
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,999
positive for kovat 19 I mean
I'll even

1980
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,999
take the goat but you're gonna
tell me

1981
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:44,999
that's a fruit tasty fruit the
proper

1982
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,999
you should have heard what the
goat had

1983
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,999
to say about the whole ordeal
yeah so

1984
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,999
and and and now I'm in contact
with one

1985
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,999
of our producers who was
working with

1986
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:02,999
antibodies and tests and this
lab person

1987
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:03,999
has told me that there's been
some

1988
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,999
issues getting you know the
right I

1989
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,999
guess they'll you need the
spiked

1990
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,999
poached protein or whatever and
they're

1991
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,999
different labs from overseas it
may be

1992
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,999
India it could be China I mean
this I

1993
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,999
can't get answers to everything
because

1994
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,999
of secrecy and NDA's and things
and so

1995
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,999
it's hard to get full info but
I finally

1996
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,999
just said is it possible that
whatever

1997
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,999
the hell they're sending you is
just not

1998
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,999
really the right one and that's

1999
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,999
something that our producer
could not

2000
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,999
answer is no way to know that
so there's

2001
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,999
a lot of you know because you
can put

2002
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:43,999
perhaps the AC e to Trump is
right we

2003
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,999
got to bring the stuff back
here we

2004
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:46,999
don't know what the hell is
going on

2005
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,999
it's crazy a scammer

2006
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,999
starting to give our own
scammers that

2007
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,999
the cash exactly and with that
I'd like

01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,999
big in the morning to comic
strip

2034
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,999
blogger whose artwork was
selected for

2035
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,999
the episode titled the beaches
are open

2036
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,999
episode 12 hundred and thirty
nine and

2037
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,999
this was the Apple logo pooping
out

2038
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,999
location apparently the the
there was

2039
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,999
some scatological joke with the

2040
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,999
government because they are the
ones

2041
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,999
receiving the information from
Apple and

2042
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,999
it was the it was good I don't
know why

2043
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,999
it wasn't the best was it was
the best

2044
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:23,999
but there were other choices
didn't

2045
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,999
quite make what happened
something it

2046
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,999
was one that was the best oh
right I

2047
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:29,999
remember what it was when we go
in and

2048
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,999
take a look unfortunately it
was it was

2049
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:45,999
two rulings by Darren who just
must have

2050
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,999
been beside himself with the
chuckling

2051
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,999
to himself you know behind the
mic he

2052
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,999
see these guys picked this it
was well

2053
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,999
done 

2054
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,999
why can't I find it now and
that's

2055
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,999
interesting hmm did it get
taken off

2056
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,999
well we had the you know what
we had the

2057
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,999
comics different one from
comics or blog

2058
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,999
or we might use this dead the
other one

2059
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,999
I actually come a strip blogger
got a

2060
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,999
twofer cuz I gave him the I put
that on

2061
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,999
the newsletter no nice the
other one and

2062
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,999
but this other one I was almost
tempted

2063
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,999
to use the lewd oh we liked
well we like

2064
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,999
Tommy the heretic with
operation warp

2065
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,999
speed which was cool because it
was a

2066
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,999
syringe like the Starship
Enterprise

2067
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,999
yeah it was well done

2068
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,999
but then he had a but a female
too but

2069
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,999
we long with the thong it's
like no it's

2070
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,999
just put that in there well I
mean we

2071
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,999
don't mind a good-looking but
but it's

2072
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,999
good but if it's gratuitous
necessary

2073
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,999
but äj-- it was just not no
wave this

2074
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,999
buddish belongs on this art so
they got

2075
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,999
kicked from it for that just
from that I

2076
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,999
can't find the one that was the
other

2077
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,999
one that was so offensive it's
still

2078
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,999
there I can't find him no no I
think and

2079
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,999
I think it got removed oh no no
I

2080
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,999
remember I remember what it was
it was

2081
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,999
the best piece of art and and
even we

2082
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,999
could I don't think we could
discuss it

2083
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,999
well yeah I can just tell you
what it

2084
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,999
was it was a Kentucky Fried
Chicken logo

2085
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,999
turned into Joe with Biden
instead of

2086
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,999
Kentucky Fried Chicken it was
Joe Biden

2087
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,999
president finger lickin good

2088
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,999
and now yeah we felt that was
not

2089
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:32,999
appropriate 

2090
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,999
no and Darren no he knows that
he knows

2091
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,999
that it's not purpose just to
see if you

2092
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,999
get went through I mean is what
you

2093
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,999
always do creative types are
always

2094
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,999
trying to sneak something
through oh

2095
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,999
yeah you know it doesn't fly
with other

2096
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,999
creative types who know what
you're up

2097
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:49,999
to 

2098
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,999
yeah like it's like Disney you
know

2099
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,999
trying to hiding penises and
snow white

2100
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,999
dress and stuff like that and
we're on

2101
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,999
to get talented artists there
let's

2102
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:00,999
start with thanking a few people

2103
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,999
including oh do we have a
little theme

2104
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,999
music for Dave do you know I
don't think

2105
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,999
I mean we don't have one
special forum I

2106
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:22,999
don't think do we Duke of
America's for

2107
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,999
heartland and the REA bein
Peninsula and

2108
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,999
Gladstone Missouri well he's
not there I

2109
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,999
think he's still in Saudi
Arabia that's

2110
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,999

note that's

mother

2112
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,999
Teresa you know which ones you
are today

2113
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,999
I learned that and Jarvis the
woman Lara

2114
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,999
largely credited for creating
what we

2115
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,999
now know as Mother's Day later
become so

2116
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,999
disgusted by its
commercialization that

2117
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,999
she boycotted it and tried to
suit

2118
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,999
companies who were profiting
off the

2119
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,999
holiday no jingle the more you
know Oh

2120
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:02,999
No Agenda anyways since I
become I

2121
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,999
recall that I was one of the
two ish

2122
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,999
producers whoops sorry I was
one of the

2123
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,999
oops what do you what are you
opening

2124
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,999
about why hit that I hit a
button on

2125
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:14,999
here and it took the whole
screen off

2126
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,999

knitting a

2127
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,999

2130
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,999
the two ish producers who
supported

2131
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,999
their mothers the past five
years she

2132
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,999
had to I think that's right I
figured I

2133
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,999
should continue my yearly habit
with

2134
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,999
another one six 6.66 in the
traditional

2135
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:41,999
number associated with

2136
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,999
others I guess being that but

01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,999
indeed it is Mother's Day and
typically

2149
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,999
on the no agenda show there's
no love

2150
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,999
for moms but the tide might be
turning

2151
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:29,999
you've got in the morning

2152
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,999
and comfort comes in from
Indianapolis

2153
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,999
Indiana with $333 here we are
sitting on

2154
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:37,999
the deck of the Sunday
afternoon during

2155
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,999
the quarantine my wife asks
well this is

2156
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,999
thought this was his wife this
is an

2157
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,999
okay maybe they're married did
they're

2158
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,999
married women could be my wife
asked why

2159
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,999
are you freeloader why are you a

2160
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,999
freeloader it's embarrassing we
had just

2161
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,999
listened to the no agenda
showing you

2162
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,999
were discussing the highlights
I quickly

2163
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,999
told her she made her point
after 41

2164
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,999
years of marriage you learn
stuff like

2165
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,999
that then I came up with the
idea to

2166
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,999
make her a dame ah here's the
beginning

2167
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,999
of our tribute to reach that
goal we

2168
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,999
also ordered awesome no agenda
masks a

2169
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,999
couple of weeks ago like and
like Adam

2170
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,999
are still awaiting their
arrival get

2171
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,999
these masks out well that's not
just so

2172
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:20,999
you know that's not no agenda
shop it

2173
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,999
was a different mask and I'm
regretting

2174
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,999
it as I should have just gone
for the

2175
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,999
Gator from the shop it was dumb

2176
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,999
I should have J paint something

2177
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:39,999
everybody for every order for
every when

2178
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,999
you mention something here I
want to

2179
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,999
explore this we could have
custom

2180
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,999
painted no agenda mass this is
a huge

2181
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,999
premium yes we could we could
all shed

2182
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,999
that clutter yes what else is
Jay doing

2183
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,999
she's just hanging around the
house no

2184
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,999
she's up no she took a drive
with Nick

2185
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,999
up to the Washington even
better they've

2186
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,999
written their historical boxes
off laws

2187
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,999
apparently now I'm exempt I
could do

2188
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,999
these yes we can do we are we
are we are

2189
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,999
podcasters by law exempt your
essential

2190
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,999
personnel so if anybody's a
podcaster

2191
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,999
and making a big stink about
staying at

2192
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,999
home then they're just virtue
signaling

2193
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,999
cuz we don't have to stay at
home or do

2194
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,999
anything but after wear a mask
in a

2195
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:27,999
store obviously because they're
gonna

2196
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,999
kick you out but besides that
anyway

2197
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,999
please give some jobs karma to

2409
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,999
you say it and Adam I thought
you were a

2410
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,999
pothead but you were confused
at my

2411
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,999
roundtable request of sticky
green

2412
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,999
doesn't that prove your point

2413
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:14,999
a kind of a I guess it's been
almost 30

2414
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,999
years since the term was first

2415
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,999
popularized by Snoop Dogg

2416
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,999
lastly despite the running
belief of the

2417
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:27,999
show I indeed love my mother
but the

2418
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,999
chances of her listening to any
product

2419
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,999
podcast I'm okay with not that
it makes

2420
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,999
a little more sense it's not
that she

2421
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,999
their mom's hate the show

2422
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,999
those boys those boys are just
gonna get

2423
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,999
into trouble the way they think
now that

2424
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,999
is a good mom voice and so that
would be

2425
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:52,999
the rationale we're using but
but what's

2426
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:57,999
the podcast is probably the
real reason

2427
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,999
okay so such an ageist old man
aren't

2428
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,999

greatest podcast in universe I
figure I

2472
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,999
get off my arse which is what
they say

2473
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,999
in some countries including
Australia

2474
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,999
arse and complete my knighthood
I have a

2475
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,999
long message plan but decided
against it

2476
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,999
so I'll summarize it was longer
than

2477
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:57,999
this follow jcd here and after
listening

2478
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,999
to him on twit I did take a 2.5
year

2479
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,999
hiatus from 2015 in mid 2017
due to my

2480
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,999
amygdala shrinking so much that
it

2481
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,999
became cynical and day and
jaded with

2482
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:09,999
everything if that's a danger
that is

2483
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,999
that is a real danger some
people have

2484
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,999
that and they just they because
it once

2485
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,999
there explodes these guys I
could do

2486
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:18,999
this on my own I don't need any

2487
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,999
hand-holding thing is this is
like a

2488
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,999
part of like how Hollywood and
the other

2489
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,999
media work you have to it has
to be

2490
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,999
collaborative even means one of
us could

2491
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,999
do shows yeah between the two
of us it's

2492
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,999
the same thing yeah we can't do
the show

2493
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,999
it we could but it wouldn't be
as good

2494
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,999
and we'd be making mistakes
constantly

2495
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,999
and it would be it wouldn't
work out as

2496
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,999
you know and we wouldn't
definitely get

2497
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,999
on just the kick that we're on
of

2498
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,999
correcting people's use of at
the end of

2499
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,999
the day look at things like
that because

2500
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,999
you know you hear it on
television all

2501
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,999
the time just distressing and
so that

2502
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,999
includes the audience the
audience is

2503
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,999
the third element of the of the

2504
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,999
collaboration and so it all
works

2505
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,999
together and that keeps you
ever from

2506
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,999
you know that's why you
shouldn't stop

2507
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,999
which is a minor which is why

2508
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,999
it's obvious that we all
produce this

2509
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,999
show it's a it's a it's a tribe
effort

2510
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,999
he continues by saying I think
it was

2511
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,999
over the Obama era I have been
far more

2512
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,999

01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,999

[Music] 

2629
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,999
went wrong here today

01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,999
okay sorry about that it's my
eye man I

2631
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:12,999
can't see I have a couple of
series play

2632
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,999
here I wanted to place as there
first of

2633
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,999
all I think let me skip to
something

2634
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,999
that's a little lighter the
they're

2635
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,999
trying to scare us with this
meat

2636
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:22,999
shortage things that can make
us freak

2637
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,999
and I want to just point out
that of

2638
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,999
this show weeks ago we had a
producer

2639
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,999
from a meatpacking outfit give
us some

2640
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,999
very clear warnings that this
was coming

2641
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:38,999
yeah it's coming it's here yeah
and of

2642
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:39,999
course they're doing what they
can and

2643
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:40,999
Trump did an executive orders
they want

2644
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,999
to keep the meat flowing but so
they did

2645
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,999
a report on CBS Nora and I want
to play

2646
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,999
this is the intro to the report
and then

2647
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:50,999
she kicks it to one of our
reporters to

2648
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,999
do that you know the stand-up
this meat

2649
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,999
shortage tonight grocery giants
are

2650
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,999
putting a cap on how much meat
customers

2651
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,999
can buy as the pandemic forces
more

2652
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,999
processing plants to shut down
and at

2653
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,999
hundreds of Wendy's restaurants
managers

2654
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,999
are asking that famous question
the ad

2655
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,999
campaign where's the beef I
like that

2656
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,999
you say meat must flow it's
like liquid

2657
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,999
meat so she goes on and on and
then she

2658
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,999
cuts it says and so-and-so is
gonna

2659
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,999
report on this and this they
bring it to

2660
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,999
a guy who goes on about the
Tyson he

2661
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,999
starts reporting on the whole
thing and

2662
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,999
then right in the kind of right
that the

2663
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,999
judge sees as he wraps it up I
would bet

2664
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,999
money although they would never
admit to

2665
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,999
this but ABC does this all the
time and

2666
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,999
they're very obvious because
their time

2667
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,999
perfectly there's a native add
not

2668
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,999
dropped into the middle of this
report

2669
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,999
just right at the point where
you want

2670
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,999
to hear it and I don't think
it's gonna

2671
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,999
help sell anything but if this
isn't a

2672
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:53,999
native ad because you got to
remember

2673
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,999
they're talking about all the
closures

2674
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:56,999
and this is he's guys wrapping
it up and

2675
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,999
this is it and as a sign of the
times

2676
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,999
the impossible Foods Company
announced

2677
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,999
that it's impossible burger
which is

2678
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,999
made with plants will be
available in

2679
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,999
2,700 grocery stores nationwide
starting

2680
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:14,999
this week and it says it's
ready to

2681
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,999
expand to meet the growing
demand

2682
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,999
Nora well this would be one
heck of a

2683
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,999
battle and if the meat guys got
defeated

2684
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,999
by that the only thing that was
left on

2685
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,999
the shelves during actual
pandemic where

2686
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,999
people possibly could starve
they didn't

2687
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,999
buy that crap they didn't so
they throw

2688
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,999
this little gem at the end and
I'm

2689
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,999
thinking I wonder what they
paid it's a

2690
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,999
15 second ad it's just a spot
cheaper

2691
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,999
and 15 second has to exist
that's J and

2692
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,999
it's just like oh brother I
just rolled

2693
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,999
my eyes I killed the rest of
the report

2694
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,999
anyone play anybody's wanted to
play the

2695
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,999
native had to point out that
these guys

2696
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:56,999
are douche bags oh yeah

2697
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,999
oh yeah no you know who are
douche bags

2698
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,999
the news reporters at home who
have the

2699
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:04,999
Apple earpods

2700
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,999
in their ears Oh doesn't work
doesn't

2701
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,999
look like you got cigarette
butts

2702
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,999
hanging out of their head it's
not a

2703
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,999
good look I can't get over it
I'm like

2704
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,999
then they will have won have
distracted

2705
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,999
like why only one you know why
didn't

2706
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,999
you want to and can you hear
yourself or

2707
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:28,999
what's going on it's a dumb
look look

2708
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,999
most of the looks and sounds
from these

2709
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,999
at home guys in the beard to
grow in a

2710
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,999
beard and all the rest are in
the books

2711
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:36,999
they got books behind them all
the time

2712
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,999
that looks smart Knoll thing it
there's

2713
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:49,999
some it is so odd that people
think

2714
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:50,999
that's a good look with books
his books

2715
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,999
rarely look good in the
background

2716
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:56,999
they just don't well I would
like to

2717
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,999
death I was doing this I was I
was

2718
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,999
working for me I would do one
of these

2719
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,999
desks that is just an
outrageous mess I

2720
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,999
wouldn't have to do a lot
exactly just

2721
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,999
turn the camera on you're done
yeah I'm

2722
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:13,999
good to go I could do it like
you use

2723
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,999
this my little studio set here
and have

2724
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,999
this Gong in the background and
do it

2725
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,999
here's a I could have a couple
of these

2726
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,999
crushed cans yeah mm-hmm got a
couple

2727
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,999
crushed can you just look like
a you

2728
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:29,999
know like you're just hanging
out

2729
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,999
I have you know I just I'm s I
think

2730
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:33,999
that's the way to go no one has
the guts

2731
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,999
to do that do you have you have
crushed

2732
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,999
cans just in case in your
studio well

2733
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:40,999
here's what I know I have these
these

2734
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,999
Pellegrino cans and I crushed
them and

2735
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,999
then I noticed that they were
good for

2736
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,999
if you were good little devices
for

2737
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:54,999
making more sounds and I was I
told you

2738
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:55,999
this before I thought just to
make a

2739
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,999
good Geiger counter sound that's

2740
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,999
actually pretty good Geiger
conscious

2741
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:04,999
you you have you have these
things since

2742
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,999

02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,999
showed up but I think it came
well zero

2748
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:30,999
heads they always have some
kind of I

2749
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,999
like how they pull stuff think
you got a

2750
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:33,999
link out of them though they're
good for

2751
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,999
headlines but apparently
Reuters is

2752
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,999
reporting that the Trump
administration

2753
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:42,999
is getting ready to release
plans to

2754
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:47,999
initiate a pact among several
nations

2755
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,999
our allies for mining the moon
and

2756
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,999
there's going to be a so it'll
be a an

2757
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,999
international agreement that it
will be

2758
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,999
called the Artemis Accords now
Artemis I

2759
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,999
think is the name of this
mission or the

2760
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:05,999
name of the of the next of the
next

2761
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:07,999
mission to the moon yeah I have
so much

2762
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:13,999
trouble believing all this I
mean 50

2763
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,999
years ago we landed a tinkertoy
wrapped

2764
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:21,999
in tinfoil on the moon it's
since then

2765
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:25,999
we have we went from a phone
that if you

2766
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,999
if you touch the wires it could
actually

2767
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,999
shock YouTube a phone that is
now a

2768
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,999
supercomputer in your pocket
that the

2769
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,999
advance is the Internet all
this stuff

2770
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,999
why isn't Elon Musk already
spinning

2771
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,999
doughnuts on the moon in his
Tesla I

2772
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,999
just don't understand what

2773
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,999
happened and I wonder if we're
ever

2774
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:50,999
going to get to the moon again
anyway

2775
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:52,999
that's all I had to say on that
okay I

2776
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,999
think that's valid as a valid
opinion

2777
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,999
yeah I wanted to play these
three clips

2778
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:58,999
because this is the media is
losing

2779
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,999
their kind of their people are
losing

2780
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,999
interest in kovat oh no got to
bring

2781
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,999
them back in the fold so let's
go with

2782
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,999
this one this is Nora opens
with mutant

2783
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,999
virus-- Wow

2784
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:14,999
hold on a second where is yes
got it as

2785
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:16,999
we come on the air tonight
coronavirus

2786
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,999
infections are still growing in
much of

2787
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,999
the country just as we're
learning there

2788
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,999
is now a more powerful mutant
strain of

2789
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:26,999
the virus that is even more
difficult to

2790
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,999
treat there are now more than
20,000 new

2791
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,999
confirmed cases every day here
in the

2792
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,999
United States and while cases
are

2793
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,999
declining in the New York City
area the

2794
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,999
epicenter of the crisis
elsewhere the

2795
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,999
rate of infection is rising
still 44

2796
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,999
states are moving forward with
lifting

2797
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,999
restrictions and tonight
President Trump

2798
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,999
is acknowledging those moves to
reopen

2799
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,999
could lead to even more deaths
telling

2800
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,999
reporters today that Americans
should

2801
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,999
quote think of themselves as
warriors

2802
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,999
okay couple of things first of
all the

2803
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,999
way she does that report it
makes it

2804
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,999
sound just 20,000 new cases of
the

2805
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:07,999
mutant virus term mutant virus
whoever

2806
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,999
put this this story together
had her

2807
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,999
read it across information so
she went

2808
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:14,999
from one subject to another

2809
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,999
she says the difference I want
you to

2810
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:18,999
play the beginning of this
again and

2811
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,999
listen to this where she is
claiming if

2812
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,999
the waves just listened to her
that

2813
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,999
there's 20,000 new cases of the
mutant

2814
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,999
virus as we come on the air
tonight

2815
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,999
coronavirus infections are
still growing

2816
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,999
in much of the country just as
we're

2817
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:36,999
learning there is now a more
powerful

2818
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,999
mutant strain of the virus by
the way

2819
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,999
mutants drain mutant strain of
the

2820
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,999
viruses that is even more
difficult to

2821
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,999
treat there are now more than
20,000 new

2822
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,999
confirmed cases every day here
in the

2823
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:50,999
United States

2824
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:51,999
and while cases are to the
right of

2825
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,999
course of course

2826
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,999
this poor copy never follows up
on the

2827
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,999
information so I have an old
herbs clip

2828
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,999
from democracy now this is this
the clip

2829
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,999
is called source of mutant
strain a new

2830
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:07,999
study finds the novel
coronavirus that

2831
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,999
emerged in China mutated in
Europe in

2832
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,999
February to become more
contagious

2833
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,999
speeding it's spread around the
globe

2834
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,999
the report from the Los Alamos
National

2835
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,999
Laboratory also warns the
mutated strain

2836
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,999
could leave people vulnerable
to a

2837
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:24,999
second infection of kovat 19
the finding

2838
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,999
has not been peer reviewed and
the

2839
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:27,999
director of the National
Institutes of

2840
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:27,999
Health 

2841
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,999
urge caution saying the study
draws

2842
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,999
sweeping conclusions about the
virus

2843
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:33,999
that might not hold up to
further

2844
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,999
scrutiny the authors of the
study said

2845
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:38,999
they release the study early so
that

2846
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,999
people who are working on
vaccines could

2847
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:45,999
see their results what this is
Lamy

2848
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,999
people working on vaccines can
see their

2849
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:55,999
results this is bullcrap
stretch this

2850
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,999
out a little more well if you
can't do

2851
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,999
it with the new do I love the
way Nora

2852
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:03,999
pronounces mutant mutant yeah
you can't

2853
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,999
whoops there goes his effort
well how we

2854
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:11,999
doing seven cars yeah it was
really late

2855
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,999
that is effort is hours late so
that is

2856
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,999
not a good sign we would like
to see a

2857
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,999
solid nine cars is a stable
good economy

2858
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:25,999
eight is made is ok it's ok
we've had a

2859
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,999
ten in the past seven I mean at
least

2860
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,999
it's running it may be late but
it's

2861
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,999
running happy about way they
weren't

2862
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:33,999
gonna be so late

2863
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,999
okay so here's it's not bad
enough that

2864
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:41,999
the mutant just drained the
virus is

2865
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,999
gonna kill you try this one
mystery

2866
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,999
kovat children's disease now to
a

2867
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:47,999
mystery illness that's putting
otherwise

2868
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,999
healthy children in the
hospital more

2869
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:51,999
than a dozen children in the
New York

2870
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,999
City area have ended up in
intensive

2871
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,999
care with severe symptoms
possibly

2872
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,999
linked to corona virus all this
as

2873
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,999
parents start thinking about
camp and

2874
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,999
school here's our chief medical

2875
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:03,999
correspondent dr. John

2876
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,999
Pook 14 year old jack McMorrow
loves

2877
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,999
music and video games two weeks
ago a

2878
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,999
rash on his hands quickly led
to a fever

2879
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,999
of over a hundred and four
degrees he

2880
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:14,999
was rushed to the ICU and tested

2881
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,999
positive for kovat 19 john
McMorrow is

2882
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,999
his father his heart rate was
over 160

2883
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,999
it was the scariest point in my
life I

2884
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:24,999
do as nothing anyone can do it
he

2885
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,999
prepared me for the worst Jack
finally

2886
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,999
responded to steroid treatment
and

2887
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:30,999
doctors continued to monitor
his heart

2888
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,999
function at Morgan Stanley
Children's

2889
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:33,999
Hospital in New York I'll have
a very

2890
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,999
fast heart rate they'll be
they'll have

2891
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,999
a high fever and if their heart
rate

2892
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,999
still stays very high they will

2893
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,999
oftentimes come to the ICU for
extra

2894
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,999
support researchers are now

2895
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:46,999
investigating COBIT cases like
Jack's

2896
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,999
and the symptoms of a
mysterious illness

2897
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,999
it resembles Kawasaki disease
the New

2898
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,999
York City Health Department
sent out an

2899
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,999
alert last night describing a
pediatric

2900
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,999
multi-system inflammatory
syndrome

2901
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,999
symptoms include persistent
fever rash

2902
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,999
swollen lymph nodes and
inflammation of

2903
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,999
the heart eyes mouth and skin

2904
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,999
hmm all gonna die yeah or at
least the

2905
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:13,999
kids will know anyway that's
kind of

2906
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:14,999
distressing jeez

2907
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,999
uh here's what we should do I
think

2908
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,999
there's always time in fact
more and

2909
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,999
more people are interested in
our our

2910
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:43,999
way of living these days and we
should

2911
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,999
start with the tracing and
tracking apps

2912
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:50,999
mentioned earlier hmm I wish
we'd have

2913
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:52,999
seen something out of South
Korea by now

2914
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,999
what is the point if it's only
to alert

2915
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,999
people and throw them into
quarantine

2916
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,999
maybe we could learn something
there are

2917
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,999
people who are positive walking
around I

2918
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,999
mean release some data please
yeah maybe

2919
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,999
we'll get more from Kanda
Naevia Alberta

2920
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,999
has launched its tracking and
tracing

2921
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,999
program go big nineteen remains
a threat

2922
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,999
but there's a drive to get out
to get

2923
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:17,999
back to normal

2924
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,999
well AHS says there's now an
app that

2925
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,999
could help providing this
information

2926
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,999
voluntarily is crucial to our
work to

2927
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,999
prevent the spread of kovat 19
Alberta

2928
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:30,999
trace together is the first
contact

2929
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:32,999
tracing app available in North
America

2930
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,999
every time users pass one
another their

2931
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,999
phones record the encounter
using

2932
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:38,999
Bluetooth encrypted data will
be stored

2933
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,999
on the phone now if one of
those users

2934
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,999
tests positive for kovat 19 the
user can

2935
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,999
upload their interactions to
AHS and a

2936
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:48,999
contact tracer would call the
numbers

2937
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,999
the phone registered telling
them to

2938
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,999
self isolate like bringing a
camera into

2939
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,999
focus these techniques give us
a far

2940
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,999
clearer picture that helped us
to inform

2941
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,999
our actions going forward now
the app

2942
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,999
stores only phone numbers no
locations

2943
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,999
it doesn't use GPS but tracking
still

2944
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,999
raises privacy questions
Alberta's

2945
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,999
Privacy Commissioner says she
has been

2946
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,999
involved and she supports
enhanced

2947
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,999
contact tracing in a statement
she adds

2948
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,999
in my view Alberta Health has
chosen a

2949
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,999
less intrusive approach in
deploying

2950
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:19,999
this app

2951
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,999
okay what is happening is in
every

2952
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,999
country the app the same
conversations

2953
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,999
being had apps are being made
and

2954
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:32,999
governments are telling their
citizens

2955
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,999
you need to give up some of
your privacy

2956
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,999
so you can do so you don't die
and

2957
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,999
pretty much is everyone's going
along

2958
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,999
with it yeah that's right
sounds right

2959
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:45,999
to me

2960
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:47,999
in the Netherlands literally the

2961
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,999
government is in the newspaper
this

2962
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:51,999
morning and an interview with
some

2963
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,999
muckety-muck and said I'm
translating on

2964
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,999
the fly well we'll have to know

2965
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,999
everything and we'll probably
even have

2966
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:02,999
to know who you're who your
secret lover

2967
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,999
is but don't worry we'll keep
it secret

2968
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,999
that's the headline because of
course

2969
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:08,999
they're gonna know who your
lover is

2970
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,999
because you want to be around
that

2971
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,999
person singapore's these phones
are good

2972
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:15,999
for Singapore is going to
require

2973
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,999
smartphone check-ins at all
businesses

2974
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,999
and will log visitors identity
numbers

2975
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,999
but that of course is Singapore
so

2976
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:24,999
that's kind of to be expected
what I

2977
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,999
think they're doing wrong is
there and

2978
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:29,999
they're calling it tracing and
tracking

2979
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,999
and you and they we've done so
well

2980
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,999
we've done social censorship hey

2981
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,999
everyone understands that we
have social

2982
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:42,999
distancing I would recommend as
a

2983
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:43,999
representative of the creative
or a

2984
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,999
consulting group social
surveillance use

2985
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:48,999
that too I don't like the word

2986
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:50,999
surveillance I would I would
not that I

2987
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,999
think social surveillance I
think it

2988
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:58,999
will work I think not again I
don't like

2989
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:00,999
to I think you're onto
something here is

2990
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:02,999
to come up with the term and I
think the

2991
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,999
two of us can do it but that's
not I I

2992
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,999
like the social part of it yeah
unless

2993
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,999
so no social social must be
good let's

2994
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:14,999
look at some synonyms okay
synonyms for

2995
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:22,999
okay Luthi social sleuthing we
could

2996
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:26,999

inspection mm-hmm

3001
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:39,999
monitoring is no good I don't
like that

3002
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,999
either I like inspection
supervision is

3003
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:48,999
a word that's kind of a synonym
spying

3004
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:50,999
and espionage those are out
social

3005
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:51,999
supervision 

3006
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,999

3011
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,999
new or new world order how
about social

3012
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:10,999
supervision that's what I said
oh I

3013
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,999
missed it I didn't hear that
one that's

3014

pretty good then social super
VIP mm-hmm

3015
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:16,999
what made me work on it trolls
aren't

3016
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:21,999
helping us socially no they're
no good

3017
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,999
you haven't graduated the top
podcast

3018
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,999
spot we can do this we can come
up with

3019
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,999
the word that means
surveillance which

3020
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,999
is what we're talking about
maybe you're

3021
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,999
not it being surveillance or
what's the

3022
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,999
other one they're doing in a
spying

3023
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,999
snooping snitching how about a
synonym

3024
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,999
for tracking maybe there's one
there how

3025
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,999
about this for an idea how
about doing

3026
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,999
what they like to do in
Washington where

3027
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,999
you change that just change the
titles

3028
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,999
of the bill means it's nothing
like the

3029
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,999
title yeah you could do that
but how

3030
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:57,999
about social awareness we do
something

3031
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,999
with that okay let's start with
let's

3032
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,999
use the word awareness but put
it at the

3033
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:01,999
beginning 

3034
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,999
so it'd be awareness um not
awareness

3035
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:08,999
monitoring I don't like that no
where's

3036
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:16,999
my social awareness protection
okay I

3037
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,999
think we've you know what we'll
we'll

3038
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,999
come back to the to the
brainstorm a

3039
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:23,999
little bit later on we'll work
on this

3040
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:27,999
well we will get it meanwhile
companies

3041
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:32,999
are also creating their own
social so

3042
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:34,999
I'm just going to use it for
for now

3043
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,999
social surveillance inside
their own

3044
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:41,999
organizations several organs as
this

3045
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:42,999
according to The Wall Street
Journal

3046
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:44,999
several organizations

3047
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,999
are going to be tracking
location within

3048
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:49,999
people within corporations
within the

3049
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,999
building to make sure people
here the

3050
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:54,999
company aims have its social
distancing

3051
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:55,999
app ready at the end of May
workers

3052
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,999
movements are tracked through
their

3053
02:15:58,000 --> 02:15:59,999
smartphones and you get a
higher score

3054
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,999
the more time in the office you
are

3055
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,999
farther than six feet from
another

3056
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:06,999
person so they've gained the
phone in

3057
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:13,999
the drawer they're gonna get a
raise no

3058
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:15,999
you have to be around people
but it has

3059
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:20,999
to be six feet so you're
standing up on

3060
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,999
your desk in the cubicle
yelling at

3061
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:29,999
people oh man oh by the way I
you know I

3062
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,999
had this desktop machine in the
studio

3063
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:36,999
which really runs runs lubuntu
in a

3064
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,999
virtual machine but we were
scanning

3065
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,999
some documents yesterday and
this then

3066
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,999
the window side of that
computer is

3067
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,999
still configured to this or
when the

3068
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,999
scanner starts it sends it to
that

3069
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,999
machine and it's fine that's
good but

3070
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:53,999
then I had to email that to to
myself

3071
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,999
and to Tina and I so I fire up
Outlook

3072
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:58,999
the machine does is maintained
it's a

3073
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:00,999
continuously updated with the
Windows 10

3074
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,999
you know virus that comes in on
Tuesday

3075
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,999
to update it for your
experience and I

3076
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:09,999
got a new experience as I found
out

3077
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:14,999
Outlook is now part of
Microsoft 365 and

3078
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,999
a part of 365 for a long 12 but
a window

3079
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,999
popped up telling me this and
told me in

3080
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:23,999
order to send an email I had to
send I

3081
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,999
had to log into Microsoft 365
so now I

3082
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,999
just want to use Outlook no no
and so

3083
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,999
and I tried to click new message

3084
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,999
no it's grayed out yeah you
can't do

3085
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:36,999
that what are you trying to do
you're

3086
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:40,999
trying to foil the way this is
working

3087
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:44,999
I thought Outlook was outside
of that

3088
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:45,999
you could use it for free I
didn't have

3089
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:47,999
to pay for outlook you paid for

I am fully back to mutt I map
filter and

3098
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:09,999
VI baby I love it and then
finally this

3099
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:11,999
is a hot off the press I do not
believe

3100
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,999
it has it has been mentioned
anywhere

3101
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,999
yet but there is a class-action
suit

3102
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,999
that's been filed against plaid
networks

3103
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:24,999
for selling people's bank
information to

3104
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:28,999
third parties illegally and
it's a class

3105
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,999
action this could be now that
it's a

3106
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,999
part of visa with all the all
the

3107
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:34,999
different venmo and all this
stuff that

3108
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,999
fits in that that's connected
through

3109
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:39,999
the plaid network into banks
and just a

3110
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,999
reminder plaid sits in between
your

3111
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,999
venmo app or your cash app and
there's

3112
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,999
many more to make it easy for
you to

3113
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:50,999
access your bank account you
give that

3114
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,999
app your login and password for
your

3115
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,999
bank account I know you've all
done it

3116
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,999
and then that app logs in as if
it's you

3117
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,999
and then acts as if it's on the
website

3118
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,999
as a person and can make
transactions

3119
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:06,999
but can do anything it wants and

3120
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,999
apparently it has been so this
should be

3121
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,999
they would sign up for
something like

3122
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:13,999
this well you people don't know
they're

3123
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,999
signing up for it because they
sign up

3124
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,999
for venmo when they think okay
I'll just

3125
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,999
put in my bank password and I
can trust

3126
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,999
VIN Milo you keep the bank
password to

3127
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:23,999
anybody else's soft millions of
people

3128
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:24,999
have done it

3129
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,999
milah I don't know why they
would do it

3130
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,999
they'd just be forbidden yeah
people

3131
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,999
should they need to be taught
in school

3132
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:33,999
in high school yeah yeah not to
do that

3133
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,999
don't give your bank password
to anybody

3134
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:37,999
I always got a kick what was
that

3135
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,999
software that came out some
years back a

3136
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,999
there's like about eight years
ago it

3137
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,999
was some sort of it managed all
your

3138
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,999
money and it did all these
crazy things

3139
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,999
and it was like and it required
you to

3140
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:50,999
turn over your bank pass well
there's a

3141
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,999
number of these their plugins a
lot of

3142
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,999
Millennials use them and that
it'll

3143
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,999
manage you'll say oh I can get
you a

3144
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,999
cheaper deal on this and looks
like

3145
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:01,999
you're paying too much for your

3146
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:03,999
insurance let me find you a
cheaper deal

3147
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:04,999
because it's

3148
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:05,999
continuously in your account
looking at

3149
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:10,999
your transactions I don't think
so oh

3150
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,999
yes what do you mean your right
mind

3151
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,999
would give that you have no
idea how

3152
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,999
successful these companies are
oh yeah

3153
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:23,999
this should be investigated
Shoop you

3154
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:27,999
hmm all right let's play the
Kaley that

3155
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,999
one thing that the one kind of
offbeat I

3156
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,999
could say that to the end well
no now

3157
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:33,999
let's fight now do you have the
whole

3158
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:35,999
thing even when the journalize
don't

3159
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,999
have to hold the yelling at the
end when

3160
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:38,999
the journalists are yelling at
her at

3161
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,999
the end yeah all right all
right so this

3162
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,999
is Kaley taking a question now
I'm

3163
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:47,999
thinking this woman who I like
she is a

3164
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:49,999
little bit over made out but
it's just

3165
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:51,999
funny yeah but I like her
because she's

3166
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:53,999
not putting up with any bull
crap and

3167
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,999
she decided you wishing me that
we're

3168
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:57,999
gonna to see if she has a
pattern here

3169
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,999
but I think the pattern would
be the

3170
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:00,999
following I think this is what
she

3171
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,999
should adopt somebody has a
snarky

3172
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:05,999
question that's got nothing to
do with

3173
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,999
anything it's just a stupid
snarky

3174
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,999
question so you answer it with
a blast

3175
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:13,999
that you have pre-prepared
because you

3176
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:14,999
know that you can see the
question

3177
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,999
coming you have it pre-prepared
and then

3178
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:19,999
because it was a snarky
question and

3179
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,999
because you blasted them you
finish with

3180
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:23,999
a big blast and you leave the
room I'm

3181
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:24,999
out of here folks I'm here all
the way

3182
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:26,999
can walk out on him and that's
what she

3183
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,999
did previous life before you
were press

3184
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:31,999
secretary work for the campaign
and you

3185
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,999
made a comment I believe on Fox

3186
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,999
president Trump will not allow
the

3187
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,999
coronavirus to come to this
country

3188
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:40,999
given what has happened since
then

3189
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,999
obviously would you like to
take that

3190
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:45,999
back well first let me note I
was asked

3191
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,999
a question on Fox Business about

3192
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,999
president's travel restrictions
I noted

3193
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,999
what was the intent behind
those travel

3194
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:54,999
restrictions which is we will
not see

3195
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:56,999
the coronavirus come here

3196
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:57,999
we will not see terrorism come
here

3197
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,999
referring to an earlier set of
travel

3198
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:00,999
restrictions I guess I would
turn the

3199
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,999
question back on the media and
ask

3200
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,999
similar questions does Vox want
to take

3201
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:07,999
back that they proclaim that the

3202
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:08,999
coronavirus would not be a
deadly

3203
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,999
pandemic does the Washington
Post want

3204
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,999
to take back that they told
Americans to

3205
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:14,999
get a grip the flu is bigger
than the

3206
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,999
coronavirus which is the
Washington Post

3207
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,999
likewise want to take back that
our

3208
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,999
brains are causing us to
exaggerate the

3209
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,999
threats of the coronavirus does
the New

3210
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:25,999
York Times want to take back
that fear

3211
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:27,999
of the virus may be expressive
spreading

3212
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,999
faster than the virus itself
does NPR

3213
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:31,999
want to take back that the flu
was a

3214
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,999
much bigger threat than the
corona virus

3215
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:34,999
and finally once again the
Washington

3216
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,999
Post would they like to take
back but

3217
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,999
the government should not
respond

3218
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,999
aggressively to the corona
virus I'll

3219
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:41,999
leave you with those questions
and maybe

3220
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:51,999
you'll have some answers then a
few days

3221
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,999
so what you didn't hear at the
end we've

3222
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,999
got cut off right the end one
of the

3223
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,999
journalists was yelling you you
you were

3224
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:59,999
prepared for the question how'd
you know

3225
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:03,999
I think I watched I would got
decided

3226
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:05,999
the actual press conference
yeah it's

3227
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,999
right at the end and I never
heard that

3228
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:08,999
wait might have heard that I
was left it

3229
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,999
on well I'd see it's
interesting because

3230
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,999
I heard it and I saw you had
the clip so

3231
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:14,999
then I decided not to clip it
but you

3232
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:15,999
can hear that question right
the last

3233
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:25,999
thing you hear are you're
prepared yeah

3234
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,999
which she was obviously so
that's kind

3235
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:29,999
of fun to show the press corps
that they

3236
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,999
have leaks as well it does work
and

3237
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:33,999
ravit reverse because she
absolutely

3238
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,999
knew that was coming she didn't
hesitate

3239
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,999
for a second on that no she
went right

3240
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:38,999
to it

3241
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:42,999
she had a page of all the notes
so well

3242
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,999
the hostility has started them
with her

3243
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:47,999
that should be interesting I I
was not I

3244
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,999
expected her to get steamrolled
and I am

3245
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:51,999
clearly wrong and we'll see how
she does

3246
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,999
I looked at her background I
didn't

3247
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:59,999
think so she she has one of
those she

3248
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,999
has a certain mean girl style
that is

3249
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,999
usually can take it and she's
smart if

3250
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:06,999
you look at her background
she's smart

3251
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:10,999
so she's a smart mean girl this
is not

3252
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:11,999
that somebody you're gonna be
able to

3253
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:15,999
blow blow away Lucy well at
least we

3254
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,999
have a different setting you
know at

3255
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:19,999
least someone else is answering
some

3256
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:21,999
questions a little tired of the

3257
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,999
president and it's hanging
chads but the

3258
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,999
media is theirs it's kind of I
guess

3259
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:28,999
it's been happening for a while
but I

3260
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:30,999
only put the two together and
realize

3261
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,999
that there's a new style in
news opinion

3262
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,999
shows although they appear on
news

3263
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:41,999
networks specifically CNN and
MSNBC

3264
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,999
though these are news news
outfits and

3265
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:48,999
and it goes like this you talk
to the

3266
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,999
president for some reason these
Talking

3267
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,999
Heads now believe that it's
they should

3268
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:56,999
be telling the president what
to do and

3269
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:58,999
there they're looking into the
camera

3270
02:24:59,000 --> 02:24:59,999
and 

3271
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:01,999
looking to the president have
you seen

3272
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,999
this Don Lemon does this Don
Lemon and

3273
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,999
he did a very interesting one
the other

3274
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:07,999
night 

3275
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,999
and I just went up it's 45
seconds but

3276
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:11,999
you can he's looking right in
the camera

3277
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:13,999
and it's just yeah I saw that I
didn't

3278
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:15,999
clip it by should've that you
this is a

3279
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:17,999
good clip what is it about
President

3280
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:22,999
Obama that really gets under
your skin

3281
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:27,999
is it because he's smarter than
you

3282
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:32,999
that are educated

3283
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:34,999
made it on his own didn't need
daddy's

3284
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:38,999
help not bathing at all

3285
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:42,999
wife is more accomplished this
is the

3286
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:44,999
kind of thing you don't say to
a guy's

3287
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:48,999
face you could beaten
better-looking I

3288
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:50,999
don't know what is it what is
it about

3289
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,999
it he's a black man that's
accomplished

3290
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:57,999
any president Wow

3291
02:25:58,000 --> 02:25:59,999
and he punked you on the whole
or a

3292
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:04,999
certificate thing what is it
about him

3293
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,999
just wondering

3294
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,999
this is a very odd thing he's
doing but

3295
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:12,999
I believe it's very successful
with the

3296
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,999
audience he has I think they
like it I

3297
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:16,999
think they really dig that he's
doing

3298
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:17,999
this I think it brings a new
audience

3299
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,999
though I mean them no no no
they're

3300
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:22,999
locking their audience down and
the

3301
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,999
audience is small yes it is
it's about

3302
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,999
half of MSNBC which is half of
Fox

3303
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,999
but speaking of MSNBC Morning
Joe is now

3304
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,999
doing the same thing and
Morning Joe and

3305
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,999
this is just a minute but it
went on for

3306
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,999
five six minutes is talking to
the

3307
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:44,999

something extraordinarily cruel
he's

3311
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,999
literally talking as if he's
talking to

3312
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,999
someone on a video chat it's
very odd

cruel to me by attacking me

your working weekend well you

3324
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:25,999

colleagues of ours you tweeted

3326
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,999
conspiracy theories about

Obama will you have time for
this

3330
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:44,999
you attacked George W Bush for
simply

3331
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:48,999
sending out a unifying message
just

3332
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:52,999
president I ask that you get
checked out

3333
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:56,999
I ask that you take a rest I
ask that

3334
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,999
you take care of yourself and
maybe let

3335
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:01,999
Mike Pence run things for the
next week

3336
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:05,999
you're not well it's a very odd
form of

3337
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,999
journalism that is taking place
well

3338
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:10,999
it's obviously not journalism
as these

3339
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:12,999
guys that they think so highly
of

3340
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:13,999
themselves they feel obliged to
do this

3341
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,999
and everybody wants to be wants
to

3342
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,999
editorialize I mean you can go
to

3343
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,999
Lionel's nation if you want to
hear this

3344
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:21,999
sort of thing

3345
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:25,999
from Lionel the crazy lawyer
who likes

3346
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:27,999
to scream at the camera yeah
and he's

3347
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,999
got some very good rants on
there and

3348
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,999
he's holed up at like in his
basement

3349
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,999
much like Biden is in his
basement the

3350
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:37,999
it but they're more
entertaining than

3351
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,999
this because the guy knows what
he's

3352
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:39,999
doing 

3353
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,999
I had this reminded me of the
clip of

3354
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:44,999
morning in America which I
don't have

3355
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:45,999
the whole thing I do have I
have the

3356
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,999
Democracy Now report of it and
this is

3357
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,999
that group the Lincoln project
oh this

3358
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:54,999
is the George Conway's George
Conway and

3359
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:56,999
so at a me the way she
structures her

3360
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:58,999
her commentary on this she
thinks this

3361
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,999
morning report is great because
all

3362
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,999
these smart Republicans hate
Trump and

3363
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:06,999
then of course she uses the
word lashes

3364
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:08,999
out and then she gives an
example at the

3365
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,999
end which is not Trump lashing
out at

3366
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,999
all in fact this whole lashing
out thing

3367
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,999
with Trump is nonsense but this
is a I'm

3368
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:17,999
gonna play this clip this isn't
a me

3369
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,999
talking about the but a that
includes a

3370
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:22,999
small clip of mourning in
America and

3371
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,999
then she reads a trump a trump
tweet

3372
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:26,999
yeah I don't know if these
people know

3373
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,999
that these tweets are extremely
funny

3374
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,999
and but they see him as like
some

3375
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:33,999
negative horrible thing and I
think

3376
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,999
morning Joe was everybody hates
these

3377
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:40,999
tweets yeah here we go
President Trump

3378
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:41,999
is lashing out against a new

3379
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:43,999
advertisement by a
republican-led group

3380
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:45,999
called the Lincoln project
calling out

3381
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,999
his mismanagement of the corona
virus

pandemic the one minute ad is
titled

3385
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,999
morning in America under the
leadership

3386
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:02,999
of Donald Trump

3387
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:11,999
our country's weaker if we have
another

3388
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:16,999
four years like this that
morning in

3389
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:20,999
America ad spelled mo you are
in NJ in a

3390
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,999
series of angry tweets posted
just after

3391
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,999
midnight Tuesday morning Trump
attacked

3392
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:28,999
the makers of the ad singling
out George

3393
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,999
Conway longtime Trump critic
husband of

3394
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:33,999
white house councilor Kellyanne
Conway

3395
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:35,999
Trump tweeted quote I don't
know what

3396
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,999
Kellyanne did to her deranged
loser of a

3397
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:40,999
husband moon face but it must
have been

3398
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,999
really bad Trump tweeted he
said that

3399
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,999
before but to hear Amy say it
is better

3400
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:52,999
[Music] 

3401
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,999
read Trump tweets is just
dynamite isn't

3402
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,999
this just pure controlled
opposition if

3403
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,999
you really look at it I mean
that that's

3404
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:02,999
that's I keep thinking this is

3405
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:04,999
controlled opposition I don't
think it

3406
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:06,999
is I think is because that
controlled

3407
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:11,999
opposition really resides on
MSNBC which

3408
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:12,999
is more representative the
Democrat

3409
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,999
Party as a whole well Amy may
be a

3410
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:17,999
Democrat she's really a Bernie
bro and

3411
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,999
the Lincoln group the Lincoln
group is

3412
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:22,999
real for sure that's controlled

3413
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:24,999
opposition isn't it I mean
there's my ID

3414
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:26,999
but who's controlling the
control

3415
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:32,999
Kellyanne Conway I don't know
maybe okay

3416
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:34,999
this could not be a healthy
relationship

3417
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,999
I don't there may be something
to the

3418
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:39,999
theory that this is all planned
and

3419
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,999
controlled because - he's
insulting

3420
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:44,999
Kellyanne and George in that
little

3421
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,999
tweet in a funny kind of way
calling me

3422
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:49,999
a loser and you know your
husband you

3423
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:51,999

someone you

02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,999
called somebody calls your
husband a

3425
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:59,999
loser moon face moon face loser
of a

3426
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:03,999
husband I don't know maybe I
find it

3427
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:04,999
amusing 

3428
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:06,999
I like that the tweets are
funnier than

3429
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:08,999
that stupid morning in America
thing

3430
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,999
it's morning in America and
there's

3431
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,999
thousand points of light

3432
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,999
I was I was shocked I will say
shocked

3433
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:21,999
that Project Veritas comes out
with the

3434
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,999
big news with undercover video
and voice

3435
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:29,999
altered witnesses that CBS
faked a shot

3436
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:31,999
Oh No

3437
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:36,999
yes I'm shocked shocked this is
so what

3438
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:36,999
a waste

3439
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,999
so the and I got a minute from
their

3440
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:41,999
from their teaser report well
just

3441
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:45,999
listen to it this happens five
times a

3442
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:53,999
day at least you're telling me
you're a

3443
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,999
hundred percent certain that
CBS News

3444
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,999
CBS News Corporation national
staged a

3445
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:03,999
fake event they fake the news
they faked

3446
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,999
the reality and broadcasted
that to all

3447
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,999
of their audience last Friday
on CBS

3448
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:13,999
this morning only six states
have

3449
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:15,999
reported more cases than
Michigan but

3450
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:17,999
fewer than 2% of its people
have been

3451
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,999
tested for the virus in our
series on

3452
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:22,999
the state of coronavirus
testing Adriana

3453
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:24,999
Diaz shows how Michigan is
trying to

3454
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:26,999
improve a system that has
failed some of

3455
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,999
its people but the governor
says testing

3456
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:31,999
above all else will help
determine when

3457
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:46,999
to fully reopen

3458
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,999
all right so the whole report
is this

3459
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,999
bad and and what happened is
they were

3460
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,999
going to do a shot of a line of
cars

3461
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,999
waiting to test to be tested for

3462
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,999
coronavirus and there was
almost no one

3463
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,999
there so CBS arranged a whole
bunch of

3464
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,999
fake cars and patients and of
course

3465
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:09,999
sadly there were some actual
people who

3466
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:10,999
were waiting for about an hour
because

3467
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:12,999
of the shenanigans who really
were

3468
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,999
patients to be tested yeah I
drove past

3469
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:17,999
the Berkeley testing thing
which is that

3470
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,999
no cars zero not even one car
was gonna

3471
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:21,999
drive through it just asked him
a few

3472
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,999
questions I should have when
you brought

3473
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:26,999
my little camcorder but this
Veritas

3474
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:30,999
would like the heartbeat music
you know

3475
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,999
women that one woman who I can't

3476
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:35,999
remember her name but she does
a bunch

3477
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:37,999
of videos on YouTube but-- she
did the

3478
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,999
expose and showing all these
the day

3479
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:42,999
before shot you know all these
people

3480
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,999
lined up the ambulances are
coming in

3481
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:46,999
the next day a bunch of locals
yeah here

3482
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:50,999
we go it was unbelievable we
went to the

3483
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:52,999
site of the CBS news crew there

3484
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,999
lining up cars but they weren't
cars of

3485
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,999
patience no there were cars of
endurance

3486
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,999
they were manipulating the
media to make

3487
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,999
it look like there was a lot of
people

3488
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,999
being tested this was false we
have an

3489
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:09,999
eyewitness 

3490
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:13,999
[Music] 

3491
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:20,999
come on he's insulting me it
would have

3492
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:21,999
been better if it was like then
all that

3493
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:26,999
course they were all driven by
the dead

3494
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,999
and that is exactly why we are

3495
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,999
non-commercial we don't have to
do dumb

3496
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,999
crap to get people to watch or
pay

3497
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:36,999

best the

3505
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:58,999
highlight of the show for me

02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:48,999
are well you know what I'm
sorry to say

3523
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:50,999
the search engine has been
abandoned by

3524
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:54,999
its developer oh yeah being at
dot IO

3525
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:56,999
I've redirected that there
there is

3526
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:58,999
another place that's pretty
good if you

3527
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:00,999
if you actually go to being at
dot IO or

3528
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,999
Rona radio.com there's and
there's a new

3529
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:05,999
no agenda it's actually no jet

3530
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:07,999
experience it's just a
placeholder but

3531
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:09,999
there's transcripts in there
you can

3532
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:11,999
search very easily just you
know fine

3533
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:15,999
control F in your search and
then you

3534
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:17,999
click on that link and
immediately it

3535
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,999
starts playing on that word so
it's a

3536
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:25,999
search and it's a player
all-in-one

3537
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:26,999
can't beat it

3538
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,999
not really and the point is is
that we

3539
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,999
don't know what when they're we
ran it

3540
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,999
we do we don't do that we know
we're not

3541
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:37,999
archivists in that sense we
have these

3542
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,999
systems we provide all of our
data in

3543
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,999
structured format opml it's
available

3544
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:45,999
the show notes and everything is

3545
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:47,999
available and people put that
together

3546
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,999
can create great things except
we are

3547
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:54,999
developer just lost interest I
guess

3548
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,999

3732
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:18,999
have one important topic for
for these

3733
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,999
remaining moments we have and
it's an a

3734
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:25,999
dose related topic American
descendants

3735
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:27,999
of slavery this came up on the
mo show

3736
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:29,999
and of course it didn't hit my
Twitter

3737
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,999
and didn't hit your Twitter but
this is

3738
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:36,999
about a move in the political
space or a

3739
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:40,999
move at a movement and we've
been

3740
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:44,999
tracking that the Democrats
need the

3741
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,999
black vote they lost some of it
I think

3742
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:52,999
not a a substantial enough
amount during

3743
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,999
the previous election that it
made

3744
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,999
people pay attention but as you
know

3745
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,999
there are a lot of African
American

3746
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:02,999
descendants of slavery who are

3747
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,999
considering not voting for the
Democrat

3748
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:06,999
Party doesn't mean they're
voting for

3749
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,999
somebody else but that they
will no

3750
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:11,999
longer hand over their vote
without and

3751
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:13,999
here the key words to look out
for

3752
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:15,999
tangibles like give us
something that's

3753
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:20,999
really for us or reparations I
would say

3754
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,999
that is that as the big ask and
it's not

3755
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:25,999
being listened to it's not being

3756
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:27,999
discussed Joe Biden came out
with his

3757
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,999
that Biden for black America
plan which

3758
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:32,999
believe it or not mentioned the
word

3759
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:36,999
reparations and but it was in
the

3760
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:38,999
context of doing another study
to see if

3761
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:40,999
what what should be done who
should get

3762
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:42,999
it so that that's not gonna fly
we need

3763
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:47,999
more studies but did he came
out on he

3764
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:49,999
was doing which is funny if you
know did

3765
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,999
he but he was on a livestream
with Naomi

3766
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:54,999
Campbell some kind of Rona
let's hang

3767
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:56,999
out together and do a zoom video

3768
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:58,999
everyone can participate in and
here's

3769
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:00,999
what he said the black vote is
not going

3770
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:02,999
to be for free we're gonna have
to see

3771
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,999
some promises you know what are
we

3772
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:07,999
getting in return for both and
nothing

3773
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,999
has changed for black America
and in

3774
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:12,999
order for us to vote for Biden

3775
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:14,999
we can't be taken for granted
like we

3776
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:16,999
always are because we're
supposed to be

3777
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,999
Democrats or because people are
afraid

3778
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:21,999
of trouble this weathers going
to take

3779
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:23,999
care of our community whoever
wants to

3780
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:25,999
make a deal it's business at
this point

3781
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,999
you know we can't trust
politicians you

3782
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:29,999
know so we want to know very
clearly

3783
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,999
just like Trump made it clear
that he

3784
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:34,999
wanted to build the wall the
body needs

3785
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:36,999
to make it clear that he's
gonna change

3786
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:38,999
the lives and quality of life
of black

3787
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,999
and brown people obviously
can't get the

3788
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:43,999
boat I will hold the boat
hostage if I -

3789
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,999
he said it here said it first
breaking

3790
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:52,999
no no no Diddy is no stranger
to to the

3791
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:54,999
voting process he's done a lot
of a lot

3792
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:56,999
of campaigns over the years
people do

3793
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:58,999
listen to him he's no slouch

3794
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,999
I think it's they should be
worried

3795
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:02,999
about him

3796
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:08,999
I got a lot to be worried about
yeah

3797
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,999
yeah maybe I should be I don't
know what

3798
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:13,999
they're gonna do I think about
this is

3799
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:14,999
like what are these guys gonna
do they

3800
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,999
got this they got it they got
the

3801
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:21,999
country on a you know just
beaten by

3802
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:23,999
this virus and shut down
everything that

3803
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:25,999
I mean that that's weakens
Trump's

3804
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:26,999
position but then they've come
up with a

3805
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,999
candidate like Biden although I
think

3806
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:33,999
it's you know you could point
out that

3807
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:34,999
most the people they're gonna
vote for

3808
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:36,999
but bite him don't even know of
what a

3809
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:38,999
bumbling idiot that he is
because they

3810
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,999
don't get to see those clips
because

3811
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:42,999
they won't show them to him to

3812
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:44,999
mainstream media is all in for
bite into

3813
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,999
Democratic bigwigs are all in
for Biden

3814
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:48,999
and they just hoping for the
best

3815
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:50,999
they're hoping for a fluke and
then of

3816
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,999
course the peel die and the the
vice

3817
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:55,999
president become president so
that's the

3818
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:56,999
first you got ready to keep an
eye on

3819
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:57,999
did you see the I don't think
any of

3820
02:50:58,000 --> 02:50:59,999
this is gonna happen to be
honest about

3821
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:00,999
it I think it's gonna be a
one-sided

3822
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,999
slaughter and Biden's out did
you see

3823
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:07,999
the New York Times opinion
letters to

3824
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,999
the editor and this was Joe
Biden and

3825
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,999
Tara Reid whom to believe and
the

3826
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:17,999
letters to the editor included
I mean

3827
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:19,999
this is the one they published
the New

3828
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:20,999
York Times published these
letters to

3829
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,999
the editor and you know it was
very

3830
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:25,999
clear that Ted there's you know
you

3831
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:26,999
gotta listen to something's
going on

3832
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:28,999
here so we have to investigate
this

3833
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:30,999
thank you for this editorial
for the

3834
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:32,999
record I'm a lifelong Democrat
and we'll

3835
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:34,999
vote Democrat this fall
regardless

3836
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:35,999
defeating Donald Trump and
saving our

3837
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:37,999
democracy is the most important
thing

3838
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:39,999
however we do still need a full

3839
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:43,999
transparent investigation I
totally

3840
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:45,999
agree with this editorial I
don't want

3841
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:46,999
an investigation

3842
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:48,999
I want a coronation of Joe
Biden would

3843
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,999
he make a great president
unlikely would

3844
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:53,999
he make a good president good
enough

3845
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:55,999
would he make a president
better than

3846
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:59,999
the present occupant absolutely
I don't

3847
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:01,999
want justice whatever that way
maybe I

3848
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,999
want to win the removal of
Donald Trump

3849
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:05,999
from office and mr. Biden is
our best

3850
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,999
chance by the way that's Martin
tulchyn

3851
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:10,999
who was a former reporter for
the New

3852
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:16,999
York Times and they published
it with

3853
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:18,999
his name and it says the writer
is a

3854
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,999
former reporter from the New
York Times

3855
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:23,999
well they probably felt obliged
to do

3856
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:25,999
that because of the disclosure
stuff

3857
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:27,999
they like to do that's crazy
and so

3858
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:29,999
there's probably two here's who
had the

3859
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:30,999
discussion when you're in the
minute you

3860
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:32,999
know you're putting it just one
person

3861
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:33,999
usually the actually the editor
does

3862
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:34,999
take part in some of these
letters

3863
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:36,999
because they like to slant the

3864
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:38,999
perspective and so they have
this

3865
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:39,999
discussion this oh this is a
great

3866
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:41,999
letter look at this he slams
Trump to

3867
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:43,999
all things isn't that one of
our old

3868
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,999
writers oh shit

3869
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:47,999
just pull this one and run a
different

3870
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,999
one now you know I kind of like
it all

3871
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:52,999
we have to do just put the
disclaimer in

3872
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:56,999
there that good letter that we
wanted to

3873
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:57,999
put it in there no one's good
nobody

3874
02:52:58,000 --> 02:52:59,999
reads us is gonna think
anything about

3875
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:00,999
it 

3876
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,999
whereas anybody who is not a
normal

3877
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:05,999
stood for the time to think
what it kind

3878
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:07,999
of corruption is this why don't
you just

3879
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:09,999
have the editor write-up phony
letter to

3880
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:14,999
herself or himself sorry yeah

3881

3884
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:23,999

New York City mola well Nora

02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:37,999
in New York are down
significantly from

3891
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:39,999
their peak just a few weeks ago
we're

3892
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,999
still losing more than 200
people a day

3893
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:44,999
to this virus so many that
bodies are

3894
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:46,999
being stored in makeshift
morgues like

3895
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:48,999
those white refrigerator trucks
that you

3896
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:50,999
see behind me there and that is
why

3897
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:51,999
there is so much hope in this

3898
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:53,999
experimental new vaccine that
could be

3899
02:53:54,000 --> 02:54:00,999
ready by this fall up with it
I'm

3900
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:04,999

for the industry I got two
clips I've

02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:11,999
finished things off I just want
to know

3904
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:12,999
what commentary I would just
like to run

3905
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:14,999
through one bit of information
then both

3906
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,999
of your clips are good to go
now I have

3907
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:18,999
one bit of information and the
clip then

3908
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:19,999
you're good to go

3909
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:23,999
will that work Zion fine okay
bit of

3910
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,999
information why Michael Flynn
remember

3911
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:28,999
we asked this question why was
he so

3912
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:32,999
data theories are rolling yes
well this

3913
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:37,999
is from our military
intelligence who

3914
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:39,999
knows Flynn personally I can
attest to

3915
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:39,999
that 

3916
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:44,999
this is Agent Orange and he
says here is

3917
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:48,999
why it's a one to five point
list one

3918
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:50,999
I'm glad that he's chimed in by
the way

3919
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,999
yeah one he knows what happened
in Libya

3920
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,999
and how Hillary Clinton moved
weapons

3921
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:58,999
from Libya to Syria when she
was running

3922
02:54:59,000 --> 02:54:59,999
the state two

3923
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:03,999
- he knows how Ukraine played
of em and

3924
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:05,999
this is verbatim he knows how
Ukraine

3925
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:07,999
played a vital role in supplying

3926
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:11,999
moderate rebels in Tunisia and
Egypt for

3927
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:15,999
the Arab Spring pen three

3928
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,999
he knows the lost man pads in
Libya were

3929
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:20,999
repurchased and the CIA gave
them to

3930
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,999
Qatar who sold them to the
Taliban that

3931
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:25,999
shot down a US chopper with him
with a

3932
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:31,999
whole SEAL team on him for
heinous oops

3933
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,999
for he knows who gave the
stand-down

3934
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:38,999
order regarding Benghazi and
finally he

3935
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,999
was going to audit the
intelligence

3936
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:46,999
agencies I think that says
enough that

3937
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,999
sounds right I like the whole
list it's

3938
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:53,999
a good it's a good list
anything to keep

3939
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:55,999
us from speculating is a plus
yep and

3940
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:59,999
then this is my final story
where

3941
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:01,999
political correctness and over

3942
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:03,999
socialization has just gone too
far in

3943
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:07,999
my book this is Alaska hated

removed the New York Times

3947
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:15,999
Network from teacher resources
and

3948
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:17,999
getting more attention it
removed five

3949
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:19,999
books from the curriculum the

3950
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:21,999
controversial because of words
like rape

3951
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:23,999
and incest and sexual
references and

3952
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:25,999
language and things that are
pretty

3953
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:29,999
serious problems especially in
our

3954
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:31,999
teenage world the novels in
question I

3955
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,999
Know Why the Caged Bird Sings
catch-22

3956
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:38,999
Invisible Man things they
carried and

3957
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:40,999
that scott Fitzgerald's The
Great Gatsby

3958
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,999
which is one of the top ten
most read

3959
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:45,999
books amongst high school
students in

3960
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:47,999
the nation it's really baffling
that

3961
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,999
this is taking place well those
are

3962
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,999
seminal books well they've been
taken

3963
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:55,999
out of the curriculum Catcher
in the Rye

3964
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,999
which is a very important book
that kids

3965
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:02,999
read no no catch 20 catch 22
not catch

3966
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,999
her in their eye catcher in the
wrong

3967
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:07,999
catch-22 catch-22 is a
fantastic course

3968
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,999
it's a great book it shows you
the

3969
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:12,999
ludicrous nature of certain
kinds of

3970
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:13,999
bureaucracies 

3971
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,999
that would be the problem and
then you

3972
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,999
have the Invisible Man which is
a I'm

3973
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:21,999
assuming it's the Invisible Man
that

3974
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:23,999
would be a great novel by Ralph
Ellison

3975
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,999
yes and ya know this is ludica
they

3976
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,999
didn't catch 22 still okay

3977
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:33,999
no catch no I'm sorry I'm get
deep eyes

3978
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:33,999
still okay

3979
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,999
yeah but Maya Angelou is not
okay and

3980
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,999
the great gatsby because
because of the

3981
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:43,999
great gatsby is minor and I
mean it's a

3982
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:44,999
great book it's a great
structure but

3983
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:46,999
there's always taught in
English classes

3984
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:48,999
for its balance it's one of the
best

3985
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,999
structured novels ever written
but it

3986
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,999
but in terms of the rape and
all the

3987
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:56,999
rest of it it's like it's gonna
it's not

3988
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:58,999
with the books about okay well
they got

3989
02:57:59,000 --> 02:57:59,999
something wrong with him up
there then

3990
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:07,999
sounds like Texas I don't think
so take

3991
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:13,999
that back I'm sorry Texas yes
okay I get

3992
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:14,999
the two clips I wonder if I
meant to

3993
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:16,999
play last night last year I'm
playing it

3994
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:18,999
now this is a San Francisco
protests

3995
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:22,999
over hotels mmm Dookie in
California

3996
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:24,999
medical students and doctors
with the UC

3997
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,999
San Francisco do not harm
coalition

3998
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:29,999
staged a die-in outside the
home of San

3999
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:31,999
Francisco mayor London breed
Wednesday

4000
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,999
to protest her refusal to
swiftly move

4001
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,999
unhoused people into hotel
rooms the

4002
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:39,999
dying lasted thirty minutes to
symbolize

4003
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,999
thirty thousand vacant hotel
rooms in

4004
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:44,999
the city that could be used to
how is

4005
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:46,999
the homeless during the
pandemic the

4006
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:48,999
protesters also hold a moment
of silence

4007
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:50,999
for three unhoused people in San

4008
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:55,999
Francisco who've died of kovat
nineteen

4009
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,999
so that's because the hotels
have heard

4010
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:00,999
about this scheme and they said
no now

4011
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,999
we're not going to do that and
they Bri

4012
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:04,999
does know how to make him do it
they

4013
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:06,999
can't make him do it they don't
and they

4014
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:07,999
can't make him do it so the
whole things

4015
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:09,999
that fell apart that whole idea
now the

4016
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:12,999
last one which is the best flip
aha is

4017
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:16,999
the California beaches clip of
course it

4018
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,999
is in California Governor Gavin
Newsom

4019
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:21,999
