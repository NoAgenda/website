pharmaceuticals to make sure that we"},{"timestamp":2663,"text":"are not dependent on China anymore for"},{"timestamp":2665,"text":"this so the reason it took place is"},{"timestamp":2667,"text":"because other people that sat in this"},{"timestamp":2669,"text":"chair maybe not right here but this is a"},{"timestamp":2672,"text":"beautiful place because they were"},{"timestamp":2673,"text":"foolish you could even say because they"},{"timestamp":2676,"text":"were stupid because they allowed this to"},{"timestamp":2678,"text":"happen and it's not only China you take"},{"timestamp":2680,"text":"a look at Ireland they make our drugs"},{"timestamp":2681,"text":"everybody makes our drugs except us and"},{"timestamp":2684,"text":"we've already done it

need to talk through it"},{"timestamp":2739,"text":"because she presses him and she uses"},{"timestamp":2742,"text":"something and that's why I'm suspicious"},{"timestamp":2744,"text":"of the question well when will we get to"},{"timestamp":2746,"text":"that 95 percent everything made here and"},{"timestamp":2749,"text":"he seemed rattled when we get 94 percent"},{"timestamp":2753,"text":"of antibiotics made in this country do"},{"timestamp":2755,"text":"you have a target date for that I think"},{"timestamp":2756,"text":"we will have it done within two years"},{"timestamp":2758,"text":"you know it doesn't go that quickly and"},{"timestamp":2760,"text":"frankly you put me in a very bad"},{"timestamp":2763,"text":"negotiating position by asking me those"},{"timestamp":2765,"text":"questions you know we're talking about"},{"timestamp":2766,"text":"this now I'm supposed to call up my guys"},{"timestamp":2769,"text":"I mean you put me in a very

a big show"},{"timestamp":2783,"text":"right it's going to do very well tonight"},{"timestamp":2784,"text":"but you do take away a lot of my cards"},{"timestamp":2786,"text":"when you're answering asking me a"},{"timestamp":2788,"text":"question like that you understand that"},{"timestamp":2789,"text":"yes here's the bottom line I met with a"},{"timestamp":2791,"text":"drug company six months ago I said you"},{"timestamp":2793,"text":"got to stop making the drugs here"},{"timestamp":2795,"text":"you're gonna start making them here and"},{"timestamp":2796,"text":"they do it for two reasons"},{"timestamp":2798,"text":"a cost reason but it's no longer so much"},{"timestamp":2800,"text":"cost because we can do things here for"},{"timestamp":2803,"text":"the same price and in some cases less"},{"timestamp":2805,"text":"and then you don't have the"},{"timestamp":2806,"text":"transportation problems we're taking"},{"timestamp":2808,"text":"care of our look another reason I got"},{"timestamp":2811,"text":"elected and some people don't like the"},{"timestamp":2814,"text":"sound of it and other countries don't"},{"timestamp":2815,"text":"like it but I said I'm sorry it's

normally"},{"timestamp":2836,"text":"do it but when he does it I believe this"},{"timestamp":2838,"text":"is when he says look yeah yeah exactly"},{"timestamp":2841,"text":"yeah so he said look I met with the with"},{"timestamp":2843,"text":"the pharma guys six months ago so I've"},{"timestamp":2847,"text":"been telling them you got to bring it"},{"timestamp":2848,"text":"back and I'm sure that you know similar"},{"timestamp":2850,"text":"to what has happened in the past they're"},{"timestamp":2854,"text":"waiting for something to sweeten the"},{"timestamp":2858,"text":"deal and that's why I think he protests"},{"timestamp":2863,"text":"too much I think it this was maybe the"},{"timestamp":2865,"text":"whole thing was part of his negotiating"},{"timestamp":2867,"text":"it could be I haven't figured it out"},{"timestamp":2870,"text":"what could be cuz he did you know oh no"},{"timestamp":2873,"text":"you're gonna ruin I only have one other"},{"timestamp":2887,"text":"question from this but it's a good one"},{"timestamp":2889,"text":"and his answer was very complete and"},{"timestamp":2891,"text":"this comes on the heels of at least the"},{"timestamp":2896,"text":"knowledge being out there according to"},{"timestamp":2898,"text":"The Spectator in Australia that there is"},{"timestamp":2900,"text":"a five eyes intelligence report so"},{"timestamp":2902,"text":"that's the

true or how deep it goes but"},{"timestamp":2921,"text":"Trump has a very outspoken opinion on"},{"timestamp":2923,"text":"this and he got a question about it from"},{"timestamp":2925,"text":"some dude who called in it was black guy"},{"timestamp":2927,"text":"and he he looked and he well he sounds"},{"timestamp":2930,"text":"as stoned as he looked mr. president I"},{"timestamp":2933,"text":"have a question for you is there enough"},{"timestamp":2935,"text":"evidence that China made a global"},{"timestamp":2939,"text":"community of by the scorn of our"},{"timestamp":2941,"text":"if it's so hot your global community"},{"timestamp":2945,"text":"respond yeah well I don't lose any"},{"timestamp":2950,"text":"question about it we wanted to go in"},{"timestamp":2952,"text":"they didn't want us to go in early very"},{"timestamp":2953,"text":"early you'll see that because things are"},{"timestamp":2955,"text":"coming out that are pretty compelling"},{"timestamp":2957,"text":"now so I don't think there's any"},{"timestamp":2960,"text":"question don't forget China tried to"},{"timestamp":2961,"text":"blame it first on some of our soldiers"},{"timestamp":2964,"text":"that turned out did not go too far I'm"},{"timestamp":2966,"text":"sorry I do need to mention I have edited"},{"timestamp":2969,"text":"this clip in two spots because Trump"},{"timestamp":2971,"text":"I've learned speaks and what I call"},{"timestamp":2973,"text":"hanging chads so he'll talk he'll be"},{"timestamp":2976,"text":"he'll be talking about something then"},{"timestamp":2978,"text":"all sudden he drops down into a"},{"timestamp":2980,"text":"repetitive sentence about how he looks"},{"timestamp":2982,"text":"oh and I closed it up on time and they"},{"timestamp":2984,"text":"told me not to and then they closed it"},{"timestamp":2986,"text":"and then he comes back to the stores"},{"timestamp":2987,"text":"like this is like one of his rallies"},{"timestamp":2989,"text":"yeah so it's a hanging Chad thing so I"},{"timestamp":2991,"text":"just snipped it off and I really got"},{"timestamp":2994,"text":"very upset with that that was not right"},{"timestamp":2996,"text":"China tried to blame Europe for this no"},{"timestamp":2999,"text":"I know you saw evidence that gave you a"},{"timestamp":3002,"text":"high confidence that the

we can illuminate"},{"timestamp":3010,"text":"any more about that yeah we're gonna be"},{"timestamp":3012,"text":"giving a very strong report as to"},{"timestamp":3014,"text":"exactly what we think happened and I"},{"timestamp":3017,"text":"think it'll be very conclusive is there"},{"timestamp":3019,"text":"any suggestion that it was anything"},{"timestamp":3020,"text":"nefarious or that it was just a mistake"},{"timestamp":3022,"text":"so I think they made personally I think"},{"timestamp":3025,"text":"they made a horrible mistake and they"},{"timestamp":3027,"text":"didn't want to admit it we wanted to go"},{"timestamp":3029,"text":"in they didn't want us there even world"},{"timestamp":3031,"text":"health wanted to go in they were"},{"timestamp":3032,"text":"admitted but much later you know not"},{"timestamp":3034,"text":"immediately and my opinion is they made"},{"timestamp":3037,"text":"a mistake they tried to cover it they"},{"timestamp":3038,"text":"tried to put it out it's like a fire you"},{"timestamp":3041,"text":"know it's really like trying to put out"},{"timestamp":3042,"text":"a fire they couldn't put out the fire"},{"timestamp":3044,"text":"what they really treated the world badly"},{"timestamp":3047,"text":"on they stopped people going into China"},{"timestamp":3051,"text":"but they didn't stop people going into"},{"timestamp":3054,"text":"the USA and all over the world so you"},{"timestamp":3057,"text":"could fly out of Wuhan where the primary"},{"timestamp":3060,"text":"problem was all of the problem"},{"timestamp":3062,"text":"essentially also where the

Beijing and you"},{"timestamp":3069,"text":"couldn't go to any place in China so"},{"timestamp":3073,"text":"what's that all about"},{"timestamp":3074,"text":"in other words they"},{"timestamp":3075,"text":"they had a problem I think they were"},{"timestamp":3077,"text":"embarrassed by the problem very"},{"timestamp":3078,"text":"embarrassed and you know the case could"},{"timestamp":3081,"text":"be made they said hey look this is gonna"},{"timestamp":3083,"text":"have a huge impact on China but here's"},{"timestamp":3085,"text":"the thing they allowed this to go into"},{"timestamp":3087,"text":"our country they allowed it to go into"},{"timestamp":3089,"text":"other countries they change how you feel"},{"timestamp":3091,"text":"about president G does it change your"},{"timestamp":3093,"text":"relationship with him I'm not going to"},{"timestamp":3095,"text":"say anything I had a very good"},{"timestamp":3097,"text":"relationship he's a strong man

were"},{"timestamp":3292,"text":"reporting on what the scientists said"},{"timestamp":3296,"text":"reporting on the reality of it okay okay"},{"timestamp":3300,"text":"right and that's what he meant by you"},{"timestamp":3302,"text":"gotta take this in context well the"},{"timestamp":3305,"text":"context was the DNI was not discussing"},{"timestamp":3309,"text":"how this virus came about or

agree that the"},{"timestamp":3349,"text":"DNI reports got that right those"},{"timestamp":3351,"text":"scientists did say that well that makes"},{"timestamp":3354,"text":"sense because the last thing he wants to"},{"timestamp":3355,"text":"do is supersede because the president"},{"timestamp":3357,"text":"also didn't say man-made he said come"},{"timestamp":3359,"text":"from he didn't get into that
