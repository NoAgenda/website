media assassination episode

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,330
Unknown: This is no agenda,

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,560
Adam Curry: penetrating the fog
of war and broadcasting live

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,830
from the heart of the country
near FEMA Region number six in

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,630
the morning, everybody. I'm Adam
curry,

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,090
John C Dvorak: from Northern
Silicon Valley where today's

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,820
theme is babies. I'm John C.
Dvorak.

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:36,120
Adam Curry: Kill. My goodness,
we're just going back in time.

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,500
Everything to read rerun. It's a
total rerun. I might as well I

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,450
got the clips, I might as well
run them. They're all pretty

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,130
short. Let's just go right for
it.

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,200
John C Dvorak: Well, before you
do that, I have a three clip set

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,500
disparate disparate clips that
I'd like to run first. Oh, no,

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,880
no, dog. No,

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,640
Adam Curry: Phoebe says. Daddy
slipped these clips. Phoebe. All

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,030
right.

20
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,190
John C Dvorak: Dose got a great
bark.

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,550
Adam Curry: I should run it
through the through the next

22
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,160
time she does that. I'll run it
through the sound effects. Well,

23
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,120
you should be recording

24
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,030
John C Dvorak: it up. There's
nothing a dog finds more

25
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,970
annoying than playing dog barks
back to them.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,390
Adam Curry: Oh, yeah. I'm sure
this will drive the dog crazy.

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,300
All right. Well, well, you I
mean, this is what we call

28
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,670
John C Dvorak: this is just
theory. This reason is because

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,030
this is involving Chris Cuomo.
It's what we call an audible.

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,570
And here we go. This is
distarch. With this clip, which

31
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,760
is a Hannity show. He brings it
some Trumps to John, and it

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,240
begins with this. Joining us
now. former national security

33
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,580
adviser Robert O'Brien is with
us. When Bibi Netanyahu says

34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,780
that they will strike with a
force that will be remembered

35
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,950
for generations. I've known
Prime Minister Netanyahu now for

36
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,530
almost three decades. I'm pretty
much 100% certain he means what

37
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,010
he says. He says the Middle East
will be reconfigured as a result

38
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:10,620
of this, you know, evil attack
on on their homeland. I believe

39
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,340
he means it.

40
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,490
Unknown: What are your thoughts?
Well, I know Bibi will also shot

41
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,430
and I think he means what he
says here and like he's got no

42
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,400
choice. I mean, if anyone who
wants to know that whether evil

43
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,830
exists in the world, just need
to look at the top of your

44
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,430
monologue and hear about the
babies being killed. I mean,

45
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,120
what kind of person goes house
to house and beheads babies and

46
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,780
these aren't civilians who were
killed collaterally in a in a

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,260
military attack. These were
civilians who are wanted they

48
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,900
slaughtered? This isn't war This
is barbarism?

49
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,810
Adam Curry: I think that's the
new thing to be able to say now

50
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,510
if you're on television, it's
like I know BB well.

51
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,310
John C Dvorak: I know BP Well. I

52
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,550
Adam Curry: know BB. I know.
Yeah, baby. You met baby.

53
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,290
John C Dvorak: Yeah, baby new
horse with the actress. Okay.

54
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,410
All right. Next up and you're
desperate Clint. Now we go to

55
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,750
Cuomo calling out Hamas.

56
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,540
Unknown: Nobody wants to see
pictures of mutilated children.

57
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,650
I promise you that

58
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,630
Adam Curry: well, that we
actually would like to see it

59
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,340
just to know that it's real.
Yeah, because it's only the news

60
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,640
guys

61
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,070
John C Dvorak: real pictures, of
course, not photoshopped ones.

62
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,340
But

63
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,600
Unknown: however, the reality
should not be shied away,

64
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,050
because it's what's driving the
understanding of this situation.

65
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,640
People in America especially
have a misguided connection

66
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,630
between the plight of
Palestinians, which is real, the

67
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,870
suffering there, which is real
and going on right now. People

68
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,550
are dying in Gaza because of
Israel's necessary retaliation.

69
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,760
I'm sure kids are involved there
too. In essence, you're involved

70
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,500
there too. You should be seeing
the pictures to drive the

71
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,390
intensity of the purpose here.
And we have to remember that our

72
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,280
urgency is on those who were
captured, not hostages, not

73
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,260
hostages. hostages are people
who are taken for security. And

74
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,770
they are negotiated. These
people were captured. They're

75
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,520
being mutilated. They're being
brutalized in ways that very few

76
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,800
people have seen in this region
in a long, long time. And

77
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,630
remember, it is on Hamas, to
counteract what I just said, it

78
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,530
is on Hamas to come forward and
say, No, we're holding them

79
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,830
humanely, because we want
protection against what Israel

80
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,320
is doing because we want to
negotiate because we want to be

81
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,130
taken seriously. This is on
Hamas, Hamas loves to talk

82
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,460
they're putting out videos all
over the internet of complete

83
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,200
barbarism and savagery. They
have said Not one word about

84
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,670
treating these people as human
beings. And they have given us

85
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,130
all the evidence and
understanding that they are

86
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,740
treating them worse than dogs.

87
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,580
Adam Curry: Okay, yes, let's
spin people up to school.

88
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,700
John C Dvorak: You know, it took
me all of five minutes to find

89
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,230
out that Hamas had said plenty I
guess He didn't have the time to

90
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,990
do it because he's flying over
there wants to hang out.

91
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,630
Adam Curry: He's played this
year in the region cromoz in the

92
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,620
region. Yes, he

93
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,390
John C Dvorak: went there
because it's in the region

94
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:09,720
thing.

95
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,520
Adam Curry: It's called in the
region. Yeah, he's

96
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,210
John C Dvorak: in the region. He
is in Israel, but it's Northern

97
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:15,750
Israel, it

98
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,770
Adam Curry: seems to be in the
region.

99
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,100
John C Dvorak: So region is the
region. So here's Hamas

100
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,870
Palestinian denials,

101
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,140
Unknown: because I'm brigades
has broadcast a video that shows

102
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,560
the release of three captives
that the video shows an Israeli

103
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,520
woman and two children near the
holiday kibbutz near Gaza. They

104
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,950
were said to have been released
shortly after being captured by

105
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,000
Hamas on Saturday. Hamas sources
say that video refutes what they

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,410
called false Israeli allegations
that Hamas fighters killed women

107
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,640
and children are the video
follows an earlier statements by

108
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,330
the group that said, Some
Western media outlets continue

109
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,900
to spread Zionist slander and
lies about our Palestinian

110
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,410
people and their resistance,
which falsely and slanderously

111
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,440
promoted allegations that
members of the Palestinian

112
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,760
resistance, beheaded children
and assaulted women without any

113
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,450
evidence to support their lives
and claims Hamas strongly

114
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,940
condemns the baseless
allegations

115
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,970
Adam Curry: and that's on Al
Jazeera so that's that's more

116
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,740
more official than it would be
on on x which is probably all

117
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,110
Cuomo is looking at. We want
everybody to

118
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,970
John C Dvorak: know what Cohen
was looking at took me five

119
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,150
minutes to find that clip. And
this is an Hamas had made these

120
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,840
statements earlier way before he
came off and you act in the act.

121
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:37,410
But this is the problem you have
is that our media is just not

122
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,610
good. No, and if you're right,
yes, you're right. And if you

123
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,610
listen to the I mean, I didn't
clip it because I got too many

124
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,820
clips already and this is cut
you can

125
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,630
Adam Curry: well let me let me
jump into into some beheaded

126
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,350
baby clips.

127
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:00,480
John C Dvorak: I want to mention
one thing to listen to judge

128
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,350
Jeanine and these others on the
five judge Jeanine is back to

129
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,290
her bomb them bomb them bomb
them again, don't really it's

130
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,830
it's fascinating. I didn't clip
it. I maybe I'll clip it for

131
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,620
Sunday, but she's just off the
rails.

132
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,130
Adam Curry: And but but is she
about bombing? Because back in

133
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,570
the day, that was

134
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,930
John C Dvorak: the Qaeda. Yes,

135
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,950
Unknown: bomb them, bomb them
and bomb them again.

136
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,330
John C Dvorak: Now, she made the
statement. And again, like I

137
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,060
said, I got too many clips
already. But I'll tell you what

138
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,460
she said. She said they're
coming here.

139
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,750
Adam Curry: Oh, yeah. Okay. Let
me that's you're moving too

140
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:45,720
fast. First, we got to know that
the bait the beheaded baby

141
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:53,460
story. Which has apparently
already been debunked by the

142
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,910
journalist who wrote about it
who said I didn't really write

143
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,960
about I want to clarify, I did
not tweet, which is by the way,

144
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,090
what journalism are we
performing here?

145
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,280
Unknown: Look at a journalism is
this I did not

146
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,470
Adam Curry: tweet 40 babies had
been beheaded. I tweeted that

147
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,930
form media had been told women
and children had been

148
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,420
decapitated. But we had not been
shown bodies, which was my

149
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,360
response to reports which had
gone viral about the 40 babies.

150
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,660
Also this number 40 is
interesting. I realized the way

151
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,740
my talk was, I don't know. 40
days. 40 Nights. It's all Oh,

152
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,860
John C Dvorak: Arabian Nights.
Yeah.

153
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,130
Adam Curry: Oh, yeah. Which is,
I realized, I realized the way

154
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,530
my tweet was written was too
short to explain the full

155
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,550
context. So I deleted it. All
right now, but this this went

156
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,390
quite viral. Of course. I mean,
we've seen this end of show make

157
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,630
sure even here. Some historical
examples we

158
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,420
John C Dvorak: have one of the
Indus show mixes is dynamite. We

159
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:45,630
had the

160
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,240
Adam Curry: babies on Bay Bay
and nets we had the babies and

161
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,940
incubators that they threw on
the floor. And this is just a

162
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,100
new twist. This is This is
Nicole Zedeck. From by the way,

163
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,260
John C Dvorak: the babies I'm
paying this I should go we

164
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,510
should mention this because I've
never mentioned the show before

165
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,220
but when you study world
history, there's this was the

166
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,720
same baby stories that were told
during the during the Vikings

167
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,450
invasions of northern Europe. It
was the day we're told that the

168
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,360
Vikings came in and grabbed the
babies and then threw them in

169
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,010
the air and then caught them
with their

170
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,890
Adam Curry: horns their horns,
their horns on their on their

171
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,850
John C Dvorak: doors, but the
spears they spear them. The

172
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,730
babies the babies flying through
the air. So this is not a new

173
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,510
No,

174
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,540
Adam Curry: it's late. It's a
true and tried tactic which

175
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,770
works incredibly well. So here's
the same Nicole Zedek who's who

176
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,510
tweeted X she slashed. Soldiers
told me they believe 40 Babies

177
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,940
slashed children were killed.
The exact death toll is still

178
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,130
unknown as the military
continues to go house to house

179
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,180
and find more Israeli
casualties. I 24 News. So Here's

180
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,320
her report,

181
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,620
Unknown: David, it's hard to
even explain exactly just the

182
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,790
mass casualties that happened
right here. In fact, the Israeli

183
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,800
Miller Jury says they still
don't have a clear number. But

184
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,960
I'm talking to some of the
soldiers and they say what

185
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,230
they've witnessed as they've
been walking through these

186
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,340
different houses, these
different communities, babies,

187
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,450
their heads caught off. That's
what they said, done down,

188
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,310
families completely gunned down
in their beds. You can see some

189
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,460
of these soldiers right now
comforting each other. Many of

190
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,940
them reserves who jumped into
action, leaving their own

191
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,290
families behind as well. Not
knowing the sheer horror that

192
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,190
they were about to come to. They
say they've never experienced

193
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,800
anything like this. This is
nothing that anyone could have

194
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,880
even imagined. When you're
walking through here, baby cribs

195
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,840
thrown to the side.

196
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,760
Adam Curry: There you go. So she
actually didn't say that she had

197
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,430
seen it herself. It's what
soldiers told her. But that was

198
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,180
enough. That was enough. And it
doesn't matter what Nicole's ex

199
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,360
says. Because our President saw
evidence proof he saw it with

200
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,260
his own eyes

201
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,480
Unknown: just came to basically
I really mean it from the bottom

202
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,390
of my heart. I give him my word
as a Biden. Thank you. There you

203
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:03,810
go.

204
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,310
Thank you for the intensity of
your support. It matters. It

205
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:14,970
matters in Americans see what's
happening. I have been doing

206
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:20,580
this a long time. I never really
thought that I would see

207
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,680
confirmed pictures of terrorist
behavior

208
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,070
Adam Curry: children. So we saw
it with his own eyes confirmed.

209
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,940
It's confirmed people. And then
he he goes into his tip when he

210
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,440
lies. He always goes into this.

211
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,890
Unknown: I never saw it ever.
Anyway.

212
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,140
Adam Curry: Anyway, anyway,
anyway, not to get the actual

213
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,210
report that you will probably,
uh, maybe maybe the five we'll

214
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:53,490
talk about it. But the White
House jumped into into immediate

215
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,960
crisis mode, because Oh, no, no,
no, he didn't quite mean that.

216
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,120
Unknown: Now. We have some
latest updates coming in from

217
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,330
the US a White House
spokesperson has given an

218
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,600
official clarification, as
reported by US media, that

219
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,630
neither President Joe Biden nor
the White House Administration

220
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,750
has seen any pictures or
verified any reports of children

221
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,500
beheaded by Hamas. Earlier
during a roundtable with leaders

222
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,440
from the Jewish community. Biden
had mentioned seeing the

223
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,070
confirmed pictures of militants
beheading children. The official

224
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,310
clarified though, that the
President's remarks were quote,

225
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,970
unquote, referring to public
comments from media outlets and

226
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,050
Israeli officials.

227
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:36,270
Adam Curry: Okay. All right,
please. He's an old, old man, he

228
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,910
senile, so don't you get it? And
at this point, I think the

229
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,550
international press is like,
yeah, we get it. Okay. Oh, you

230
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,550
made a mistake. Very, very,
very, very bad.

231
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,490
John C Dvorak: Mistake. I saw it
with my own eyes firmed

232
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,830
confirmed, confirmed.

233
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:59,100
Adam Curry: So this now. And let
me just as predicted, we got

234
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,740
some emails, and I just want to
reiterate that we're not I mean,

235
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,060
we don't really care one way or
the other, you know, about this

236
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:14,190
particular stuff. You know, it's
it's fun to fun to debunk it and

237
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:18,240
take a you know, a helicopter
view. But this is not about who

238
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,410
did what to whom, what we're
trained to do is to look at how

239
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,860
everybody is being spun up and
programmed against each other.

240
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,640
In fact, arguing against each
other is part of the point.

241
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,660
Distraction, which is beautiful,
because we don't hear about

242
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,300
Hunter don't hear about him
anymore. No hunters out of the

243
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,900
news. Look at the Gaza border,
not your border. We got a war

244
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,660
president now as good for
elections. You never want to

245
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,490
change a winning team. You know,
we've been spun up to believe

246
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,180
that tomorrow October the 13th
attacks in America attacks in

247
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,100
America. It's gonna happen
everywhere. This is where Judge

248
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,890
Jeanine gets it. She's probably
on the same hill country, Lady

249
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:00,270
text, text tree that I've been
seeing. But really it's all

250
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:06,630
recall. Then even just saying
911 That it doesn't matter who

251
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:11,310
you are even. Even the crackpot
in the buzzkill have oh, we get

252
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,680
you know, you get images, you
know where you were at that

253
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:20,760
moment? 911 911 911 This is the
Israel's 911 And so that means a

254
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,020
plan. What what?

255
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,040
John C Dvorak: Why is it January
6 Worse than 911

256
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,380
Adam Curry: It was funny the
last time and not

257
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,670
John C Dvorak: just my material
once in a while. You just

258
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:38,100
Adam Curry: spiking the ball
because it was genius. So it's

259
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:46,410
so the plan unfolds and in there
and reminder. After 911 on 911

260
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,290
Osama bin Laden Osama bin Laden
Osama bin Laden is Osama bin

261
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,680
Laden. Afghanistan Of course. I
mean no Iraq Iraq aluminum

262
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,960
tubes, yellowcake The New York
Times lied. The government lie

263
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,980
to get everyone agrees, I think
Now that we were lied to, to get

264
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:07,110
us into, of into Iraq, which is
not where Osama came from, but

265
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,560
of course, it was a genius
liquidity event of some $20

266
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,180
trillion, I think,

267
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,450
John C Dvorak: over 20 plus
years lot. Yeah, 20 trillion.

268
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:15,630
But

269
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,480
Adam Curry: I think if you look
it up, it may even be more than

270
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,530
20 trillion. I know. Okay, I'll
consult the book of knowledge

271
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:27,360
while we listen to the Israeli
ambassador to the UK, because

272
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,400
it's not just 911 Oh, no,

273
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,060
Unknown: this is our obligation,
our first obligation to fight

274
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,110
back and to make sure Hamas will
never have the ability to act

275
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,220
against Israelis,

276
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,520
Ambassador to totally How are
you at responding to the fact

277
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,360
that this is really creating a
whole host of tensions around

278
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,410
the world that have become sort
of ethnically focused on both

279
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:53,220
sides? It really has erupted
debates and protests and anger

280
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,340
on both sides. How would you
like to angle the conversation

281
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,220
to be able to foster something
more productive?

282
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,390
I think that this is time to
fight and to descend the people

283
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:09,840
of Israel. And I think whoever
saw the fact that 1000 Israelis

284
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,800
were killed in cold blood cannot
speak now about both sides.

285
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,460
There is one side here, who's
the side that wants freedom,

286
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,420
democracy, cares about human
rights, cares about people's

287
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,420
life, which is the Israeli side,
and there is the other side,

288
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,590
this is good versus evil, we
need to fight it. It's a terror

289
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:32,100
organization recognized in the
US and in the UK. And you know,

290
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,210
many people are comparing to
911. And I heard many people

291
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,960
that are making the equivalent
numbers with the proportion when

292
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,710
you think about Israel as a tiny
country, just 9 million people

293
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:48,000
to actually 10 times of 911.
This is the time to support

294
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,430
Israel, the international
community should understand.

295
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,240
Adam Curry: It's 10 times 911.
And then this comparison of

296
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,050
capita no but that came out
right away Sir Brian of London,

297
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,250
he immediately it was put into
his head and I'm not disputing

298
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,400
that this isn't you know that
this is the same vibe because

299
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,700
yeah, in in Israel, everybody
knows everybody. They're all

300
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,710
related. They as by their own
admission, but the 911 meme,

301
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,620
that's a good one. We got to
play that up. Let's bring in

302
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,190
James Stavridis. Admiral Joining

303
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,980
John C Dvorak: us now with more
is former Supreme Allied

304
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,910
Commander of NATO

305
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,760
Adam Curry: Supreme Allied
Commander, I'm sorry, Admiral,

306
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,440
James got his honorifics, right?

307
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:33,900
John C Dvorak: Staff Rita's know
where to start here. Admiral. It

308
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,070
take hostages, it's the

309
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:41,430
Adam Curry: same. It's exactly
the same tone as 911. They have

310
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,750
the the news media, which flips
right into it, no problem. And

311
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,570
it's it's normal, because
they've been told 10 times worse

312
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,320
than 911. Oh,

313
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,560
John C Dvorak: you bring them
back to Gaza. And you put them

314
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,410
in civilian areas, and you
surround yourself with

315
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:00,090
civilians, and then you threaten
Israelis. If there's any, any

316
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,400
bombing where civilians are
injured, you start executing

317
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,740
hostages, it's what is that you
know who's supposed to do when

318
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,880
you hear something like that?

319
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,510
Unknown: Well, you start by
calling all of this what it is,

320
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,680
which is terrorism. These are
acts of terror. This is akin to

321
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,060
the 911 attack. And just a lot
of people hear some of these

322
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,390
numbers. You know, there have
been hundreds of Israelis killed

323
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:29,070
and there are 150 hostages. To
put that in context. Joe, for an

324
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:34,620
American, you have to do the
math of the population adjust.

325
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,300
Here we go. If you have the
math, for example, 1000 Israelis

326
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,090
killed, I think it would be well
north of that. Ultimately,

327
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,280
that's like 35,000 Americans
killed on an equivalent 911 day.

328
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,540
And by the way on 911. There
weren't hostages. So let's say

329
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,290
there are 100 hostages that
would be 911 in the United

330
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:59,220
States with 3500 hostages. So
you're right.

331
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,259
John C Dvorak: That someone
yesterday said it was like

332
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:03,989
Nagasaki, I think it was
Jonathan Greenblatt on another

333
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:07,439
network. It wasn't like 911 It
was almost like if you do the

334
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:07,889
math,

335
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,529
Adam Curry: yeah. Do the math.
Okay. So the you know,

336
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,790
John C Dvorak: okay, I want to
say a couple of things. First of

337
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,650
all the 911 analogies bad. That
was four guys, they took this

338
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,980
store some planes and blew up
pretty much took out a building

339
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,730
one shot do they want people
industries, they weren't rating

340
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:31,140
a dance party and shooting up
the day did I mean, there was

341
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,700
that was a massacre where the
260 kids were killed. It's it

342
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,820
seems more like a extended
version of you know, that

343
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,910
shooter in Las Vegas where they
just started picking off poor

344
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:46,290
innocents that were at a dance,
country and western dance. The

345
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,800
911 thing just eludes me right
now is really

346
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,950
Adam Curry: an illusion
seriously,

347
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,530
John C Dvorak: there's
absolutely so little to do with

348
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:00,000
911 It's just the use of the
term and it the whole thing by

349
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,840
bothers me it's not as though a
number of people weren't killed.

350
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,220
And that's bad enough, John, why
are we going through the massive

351
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,110
trouble of equating it to this
and that and making stuff up and

352
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,360
making it worse than it already
is?

353
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,510
Adam Curry: Because it is. It's
beyond me what's not beyond me

354
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:23,070
and all it's clear as day. By
the way, Brown University says

355
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,150
the cost of the 20 year war was
$8 trillion. Okay, 8 trillion.

356
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,760
Now, the whole point is
playbook. That's the whole

357
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,030
point. We got to do it all over
again, we know where it leads.

358
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:39,870
We know it leads to Iran. That's
that's it's obvious that's

359
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,840
that's always been in play.
It'll probably go first to

360
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,980
Hezbollah. And we have which
would be Lebanon, and we have to

361
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:51,990
get everyone into that mode.
911 911 We need money. We need

362
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,930
money, money, money, money,
money, and we have a bad guy. We

363
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:59,040
have an Osama bin Laden. It is
so unbelievably close to the

364
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,710
original 911 story. It's crazy.

365
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,420
Unknown: This is one of the only
known photos of Muhammad if it

366
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:11,280
dates from 1989 when he was 24
years old years before he became

367
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:16,080
a massive military mastermind.
He lives in hiding in Gaza. His

368
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,130
face hasn't been seen publicly
in years. But according to

369
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:25,050
Israeli reports, he's been heard
speaking about the weekend

370
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,820
attacks on Israel in this video

371
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,030
Adam Curry: remember when we had
we only had cave audio from

372
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,690
Osama bin Laden? Remember that?
Oh, yes, we have audio from him

373
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,440
in the cave, giving the
instructions which had no idea

374
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,830
what he was saying, Oh, we only
have audio of Muhammad if he'd

375
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,760
seen publicly

376
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,240
Unknown: in years. But according
to Israeli reports he's been

377
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,160
heard and heard speaking about
the weekend attacks on Israel in

378
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:55,620
this video released by Hamas has
led her masters military wing

379
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:00,330
the Alka some brigades for two
decades, as seen in this 2003

380
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,200
report by French TV network
false television he was already

381
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,800
in hiding.

382
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,280
Why? We the fighters of the Alka
Sombra gates confirmed there

383
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,310
will be no negotiations with
Israel or the US whether

384
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,600
even before he commanded the
brigades de F led a wave of

385
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,800
suicide bombings that killed
dozens of Israelis than under

386
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,850
his leadership, Mr. switched its
primary tactic to cross border

387
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,140
raucous attacks from Gaza. ATF
has escalated these

388
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,490
indiscriminate attacks into a
multi pronged assault, directly

389
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,790
targeting Israeli civilians in
their own homes.

390
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,210
Easy to remember those
rhinoplasty were at an impasse.

391
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,480
They saw that the old methods
weren't working. And they also

392
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,210
realized that by doing this,
they succeeded in creating

393
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,640
terror, creating huge
psychological effects.

394
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,960
Over the years staff has
survived multiple attempts on

395
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,770
his life,

396
00:22:55,949 --> 00:23:01,019
wait for the wounded in previous
Israeli assassination attempts

397
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:06,269
from 2001 onwards. There are
reports that he has lost an eye

398
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:09,539
there are reports that he has
lost at least one limb.

399
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,930
Earlier this week, Israeli
airstrikes hit Muhammad day of

400
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,680
his family home reportedly
killing several of his immediate

401
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,670
relatives. DFC exact location is
unknown.

402
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,450
Adam Curry: I'm gonna bet you he
shows up in Iran. I'm just I'm

403
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,570
just gonna guess that that might
be a good place for the this guy

404
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,320
is profile hasn't been spun up
enough yet. This is France 24.

405
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,820
But a one eyed one legged
bandit, like Osama bin Laden is

406
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,840
a step above. I mean, this is
this is really taking it all the

407
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,360
way you watch this guy be played
UPS exactly the same script as

408
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,300
911. And now we have to continue
to create strife inside our own

409
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,690
countries. We have to make sure
that we're all yelling, you

410
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,940
know, if you're not for this
group, You're horrible. If

411
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,360
you're not for that group,
You're horrible. Bring on the ad

412
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,020
L on MSNBC What a match made in
heaven.

413
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,450
Unknown: The thing that's so
challenging vexing about this is

414
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,050
people are saying well, could
this escalate into a wider war?

415
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:16,440
It is a water war. This is Al
Qaeda from from al Qaeda to ISIS

416
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:21,210
to Hamas. He says what Islamic
radicalism, jihadism looks like,

417
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,400
again, it doesn't seek a
peaceful resolution of a

418
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,120
conflict. This was not some
inevitable outcome. This was a

419
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,440
pre planned massacre, and how
did they send 1000s of missiles

420
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,670
into Israel? Because they were
supplied by Iran. And we'll ask

421
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,770
those questions. We will wonder
about

422
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,770
Adam Curry: houses Jonathan
Greenblatt, the CEO of the anti

423
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,610
Defamation League.

424
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,080
Unknown: Oh, that failure
happened that I saw David

425
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,560
Ignatius, who's journalism I so
deeply respect, and it was

426
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,320
reporting I appreciate and he
said, you know, they will look

427
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,410
at was this an intelligence
failure, a military failure.

428
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:57,750
Jonathan, same playbook. This
was the West's failure. This was

429
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:02,220
our failure for decades to allow
out Iran and its proxies to

430
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,410
dehumanize Zionists and Jews to
allow people to think on college

431
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:12,150
campuses at Harvard. To allow
anti Zionism to flourish.

432
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,730
Adam Curry: We say I'm sure you
saw the, the reports that that

433
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,000
all these billionaires and
business owners have said, Oh,

434
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,830
if you signed that note, at
Harvard, we're not we're never

435
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,950
gonna hire you. You're not
hireable you're a horrible

436
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,910
person saw this

437
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:34,140
Unknown: in the 30s legitimate
professors, students who came to

438
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,010
believe the poison of the Third
Reich, who came to think that in

439
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:42,870
the wake of World War One, the
Jews had literally abandoned

440
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,140
Germany. And remember what
history would Hitler said it's

441
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,020
the Jews who caused their own
misfortune. Now we have

442
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:53,340
Palestinian Hamas apologists and
their acolytes here in the West

443
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,790
are accomplices. Jonathan
saying, Israel broth is on

444
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:01,530
blaming the victim, while we're
still collecting the bodies is

445
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:05,130
as disgraceful and as
dishonorable thing as I could

446
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,130
ever imagine. The last thing
I'll say, and I'm so sorry, but

447
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,750
I don't ever remember feeling
like this before. Is that the

448
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:18,420
idea? The notion that somehow
this piece this rapprochement

449
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,840
with Saudi Arabia, they were
trying to disrupt it I think

450
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,410
there's some truth to that. But
let's be clear, that was a path

451
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,800
to peace working out a deal that
could have given the

452
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,250
Palestinians the end the
Israelis the confidence to make

453
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,930
a deal with the Palestinians.
Terror, reinforces terror

454
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:40,740
reinforces the conflict, because
that's what these these

455
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,950
barbarians want. We've got to
stand up against them every time

456
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,530
Adam Curry: so you know, it
doesn't matter what you say

457
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,010
you're gonna have someone yell
at you no matter who you are, we

458
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,830
might as well just not say
anything and even our very even

459
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,490
though I predicted these emails
would come in just two quick

460
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:00,930
ones that I'll just read your
take on Israel and the massacre

461
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:04,440
at the Music Festival being an
OP is disgusting longtime

462
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:10,890
listener I think I'm done now.
Here's my here's my favorite

463
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:11,040
what

464
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,230
John C Dvorak: was the first
line he said what he said was an

465
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,790
OP says

466
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,490
Adam Curry: Your take on Israel
and the massacre at the Music

467
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,530
Festival being an OP is
disgusting.

468
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,400
John C Dvorak: We never said it
was an OP No in fact that we

469
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,210
said it No. I never said was an
OS.

470
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,670
Adam Curry: It might have been
an inside job but not an OP.

471
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,140
John C Dvorak: Well, we fit we
fit well. In my the way I see it

472
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,940
is that this was allowed to take
place for some alternatives for

473
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,690
some for some reason, or other
because they there's no way that

474
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,890
this could have been a surprise.
That's all as far as I took it.

475
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,830
Yeah, those people were
genuinely killed. It wasn't an

476
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,340
OP.

477
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,130
Adam Curry: Well, you you.
You're like this next one?

478
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,720
John C Dvorak: I bet I will. And
by the way, we don't need people

479
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,130
like that in this audience.

480
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,000
Adam Curry: Now but it's
important to I think it's

481
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,480
important to just show this that
the strife is even within no

482
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,380
agenda nation.

483
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,080
John C Dvorak: And because we're
going to have new we had the

484
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,120
same thing with Ukraine. We lost
a lot of list.

485
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:14,639
Adam Curry: Oh, yeah. Would you
framework Oh, and guess what

486
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:17,429
turns out to be pretty spot on
about that one. But doesn't of

487
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:23,039
course, you sound like a neocon.
That's a subject from it's not a

488
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,059
real country to the nice Jews.
We're just going to pray in the

489
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:32,159
temple. You are Neo cons. Let's
just let me read it. Your Neo

490
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,399
cons. I'm gonna start I'm gonna
start over

491
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,700
John C Dvorak: it's over but I'm
just today. This is like is he

492
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,990
listening to our show

493
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,330
Adam Curry: yet? But this is
this is what happens when people

494
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:46,950
get infected by by the media
virus. It's a truth when when

495
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:51,300
people throw at you 911 The
first thing I think is dancing

496
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:56,670
Israelis or whatever. From it's
not a real country to the nice

497
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,790
Jews. We're just going to pray
in the temple. Your neocon

498
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:03,450
Zionist biases are becoming
obvious, and you sound like Dan

499
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,740
Vaughn Gino or your buddy Glenn
Beck, playing Wesley Clark's

500
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,920
clip and not connecting it to
the Zionist project and the

501
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,880
ancillary projects like mass
immigration, pornography, trans

502
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,030
attacks on free speech that they
do to us which they did to

503
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,970
Germany until they rose up
against jewelry and butthurt

504
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,690
bankers thus rallied the world
to destroy them. It is one

505
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:28,050
tribal group doing all these
things and you know it no matter

506
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:33,420
how hard your Jewish wife John
handpicks view it's going to do

507
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,750
your sole good to tell the truth
and connect the dots or are you

508
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:40,230
going to convert to take part in
the blood rituals the sick and

509
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:44,250
the interviews want to return to
and desecrate whole Muslim holy

510
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:48,120
sites? You are already halfway
there halfway there as a Christ

511
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:53,070
cook it said. So this is how
this this is Christ

512
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,200
John C Dvorak: cook him a
Christ. Wow,

513
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,970
Adam Curry: great show title.
Great.

514
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,120
John C Dvorak: Yes, a great
phrase Christ cook Okay.

515
00:30:02,939 --> 00:30:08,249
Adam Curry: So a little a little
historical background. I like

516
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:12,659
doing this. Because this comes
for because we don't get any of

517
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:16,799
this in the United States. And
this, of course, is TRT Turkish

518
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:22,199
radio and television. And so
they come at it from a

519
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:27,329
perspective that they start off
by, I think, Miss misnomer of

520
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:32,129
Palestine, it used to be Syria
Palestina, but okay, they're

521
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:35,099
going to give us the history of
Britain's role. And

522
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:40,349
subsequently, the League of
Nations and the United Nations

523
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:43,679
in this entire thing, and you
just don't get any of these

524
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,509
perspectives. Forget about the
obvious slant, they're they're

525
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:53,099
putting on it, because you can,
you can refute a lot of what

526
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:57,539
they're saying. But I think some
of some of this is good to hear

527
00:30:57,569 --> 00:31:00,929
for people who just have no
perspective, because as long as

528
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:04,349
I've been alive, and as long as
you've been alive, this crap has

529
00:31:04,349 --> 00:31:10,019
been going on. I mean, ever
since you were a boy. I'm sure

530
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:11,009
you remember always

531
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,550
John C Dvorak: been going on. I
remember, just two quick

532
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:18,540
stories. One when I was at
Berkeley, it was every day there

533
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,920
was some Jewish guy and a
Palestinian guy yelling at each

534
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,570
other in the on the sprawl
Plaza, there was every day. And

535
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:32,070
then I went, I told him the
story about this before, which

536
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:36,660
is a three hour lecture I heard
at Wheeler auditorium with Phil

537
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:41,910
Spector. And this was very long
ago, and Phil Spector mentioned

538
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,040
in his speech, that when he was
a kid, this has been going on it

539
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,690
this is never ending,

540
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:53,520
Adam Curry: and, and just for a
biblical history, this goes back

541
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:59,550
to Isaac and Ishmael, briefly.
Abraham and Sarah were told they

542
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,970
were going to have a son, the
son would, you know, all the

543
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,160
tribes of Israel would come out
of this. And Sarah, and they

544
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,370
were like, 70, or something
like, okay, yeah, sure, God, and

545
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,670
Sarah's, like, this has taken
too long. So she brought her

546
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:18,000
handmade and Hagar and said,
Hey, Bran wants you to lay with

547
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,450
her, as they say, in biblical
terms. And out of that came

548
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:25,170
Ishmael. But that but you know,
she, she used to hope to God.

549
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:30,210
And so then eventually she had
Isaac miracle. And this

550
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:33,540
literally was the Jew and the
Arab who hate each other. This

551
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,990
is literally where it comes
from. This is why when I was in

552
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,280
Bangkok, with my friend Benco,
when Israeli who was an grew up

553
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,610
and and or lived in Amsterdam,
there were just two Arab guys

554
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,530
who came into this rest, I
think, was a McDonald's in

555
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:49,590
Bangkok of all things. And they
were just dressed in blue jeans,

556
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,690
he was anything. And he said,
Look at him, look them, they

557
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,970
hate me. They look at how they
hate me. And then meanwhile, I

558
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:57,630
could feel his hate. I'm like,
what what is your problem? It

559
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:03,810
goes back this far. So now we go
down go into the history of

560
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:07,500
Israel. This is that of course.
I mean, this goes back to the

561
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,740
Ottoman Empire. Do kids even
learn about the Ottoman Empire

562
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,910
in school anymore? Only 100
years ago, not that long ago.

563
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,670
John C Dvorak: taught any of
this? No,

564
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,750
Adam Curry: it's important.

565
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,940
Unknown: When you think
Palestine you may think

566
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,760
violence, land seizures, and a
decade's long Israeli

567
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,790
occupation. But what you might
not know is that another country

568
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,970
plays a driving role in causing
the region's conflict, Imperial

569
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:37,800
Britain. From 1516 to at least
1917, Palestine was under the

570
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,160
control of the Ottoman Empire, a
religiously diverse land where

571
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,070
Christians, Muslims and Jews
lived alongside one another at

572
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:47,580
peace for the most part. Then in
the early 1900s, a small number

573
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,640
of European Jews were trying to
drum up support for Zionism and

574
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,760
establishment of a Jewish
homeland just 20 years before in

575
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,030
1897, the movements led by
Theodore Hutsul, was initiated

576
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,090
at a conference in Switzerland,
they decided that they would

577
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,910
advocate for a Jewish homeland
in Palestine. But the movement

578
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:06,450
at the time didn't have much
support. And at the time, only

579
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:10,290
around 8% of the population of
Palestine was Jewish. At the

580
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,810
same time, Arab nationalism was
on the rise, and many

581
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:16,050
Palestinians wanted an
independent state, Imperial

582
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,050
Britain you have both ambitions
of Zionist and Palestinians and

583
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:23,070
use the situation to bolster
their own interests. In 1914,

584
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,920
amid World War One, Britain went
to war with the Ottoman Empire.

585
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:29,610
And in 1915, Henry McMahon,
Britain's representative in

586
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,640
Cairo that pushed Arab leaders
with a proposal, Britain was

587
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,040
agreed to Arab independence if
they helped fight against the

588
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,730
Ottomans. Then in 1917,
Britain's Foreign Secretary

589
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,550
wrote a one paragraph letter to
Walter Rothschild a leading

590
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:44,430
figure in the British Jewish
community. It's read His

591
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,860
Majesty's government's views
with favor the establishment in

592
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,710
Palestine have a national home
for the Jewish people, and will

593
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,020
use their best endeavours to
facilitate the achievement of

594
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,660
this object. This letter became
known as the Balfour

595
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,440
Declaration.

596
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,290
Adam Curry: This is important
because I think even today's

597
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:02,340
kids should at least learn about
the All for declaration. I mean,

598
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:07,260
it gives you a little more
context than this drivel. This

599
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:12,060
this, the absolute drivel that
is being seeped out of

600
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,510
television and people in watch
television. But all these clips

601
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:19,020
get onto social media and it's
in some ways, even taken up

602
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:23,940
context is just horrible how
over socialized and under

603
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,230
educated people are.

604
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,540
Unknown: And it was in stark
contrast to a declaration of the

605
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,960
British and French armies in
1918, which showed the people of

606
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,680
Syria Palestine and Mesopotamia
of autonomy. So what was going

607
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,410
on? Britain had promised
independence to the Arabs that

608
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,140
lived in Palestine, but then
also promised a homeland for

609
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,140
Jews on land that was already
inhabited was Britain just

610
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,420
transferring land that did not
belong to them to whoever they

611
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,230
liked. When the Ottoman Empire
collapsed in 1918, the League of

612
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,930
Nations gave Britain a mandate
or administrative control of

613
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:55,950
Palestine in 1920. It was a dual
mandate. On one hand, they were

614
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,230
to act on behalf of
Palestinians. But on the other

615
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,780
hand, they were to act on behalf
of the international community

616
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,720
of Jews who wanted to establish
a homeland, Britain and drew up

617
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,630
arbitrary borders, transferring
the eastern bank of the Jordan

618
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,570
River to the Hashemites. It was
under the British mandate that

619
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,090
Jews from Europe began to
emigrate to Palestine and buy up

620
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:15,630
land. The Jewish population in
Palestine grew tenfold, from

621
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:21,000
60,000 to more than 600,000.
Between 1918 and 1947. Many

622
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,060
Palestinians saw the mass influx
of Jews as a European colonial

623
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,570
movement.

624
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,880
Adam Curry: What's interesting
is the video that goes along

625
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,630
with this, you literally see
checkpoints with people on

626
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:35,190
horses. Yeah, it's the same
thing. It's been going on since

627
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,270
for a long time, the checkpoints
there were no cars, people on

628
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,020
horses,

629
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,580
Unknown: so as one might expect
it led to conflict. In 1929,

630
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,340
riots broke out at the Wailing
Wall in Jerusalem, with

631
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,270
Palestinians and Jews lost
lives. In 1936. After Jewish

632
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:55,050
emigration increased even more,
more riots broke out. This time

633
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,230
the British were heavy handed
and killed between 2005 1000

634
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,260
Palestinians. The Royal British
Commission concluded that

635
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,200
because Britain had allowed mass
emigration, Palestine had two

636
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,420
distinct societies that couldn't
be reconciled.

637
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,050
Adam Curry: I love how Britain
kind of no one really talks

638
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,750
about Britain being the the
actor behind the

639
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,930
John C Dvorak: whole thing.
That's the reason they're so

640
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:20,700
guilt ridden. And they're they
jumping in oh, we're gonna do

641
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,870
whatever we have to

642
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,880
Adam Curry: Yeah, it's 40
seconds left,

643
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,610
Unknown: they recommended a
partition of the land. The Arab

644
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,130
hire committee rejected this,
saying it was all their lands.

645
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,530
Britain then banned the Arab
higher commission. They

646
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:34,620
introduced the white paper of
1939 white paper stated that

647
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,590
Palestine should be a binational
states inhabited by Jews and

648
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,590
Palestinians, but that Jewish
immigration would be limited for

649
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:43,890
five years. But illegal
immigration still went on and

650
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,950
violates all immigration. And
when Britain couldn't handle the

651
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:49,080
mess, they had a part in
creating, they handed the

652
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:53,130
country back to the UN in 1948.
The UN then decided to partition

653
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:56,610
Palestine. The story gets a lot
more complicated after this, but

654
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,280
the British promising land which
already belongs to Palestinians,

655
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,070
to other people has played a
part in decades of conflict and

656
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:02,610
bloodshed.

657
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,780
Adam Curry: Alright, so the UN,
the UN is like, oh, we should

658
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,450
have a two state solution.
Another thing I've been hearing

659
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:16,530
all my life and here is our
current United Nations. What is

660
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,280
the Director General? Is it,
President, Chief, whatever the

661
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:20,970
group that has

662
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,980
Unknown: this most recent
violence does not come in a

663
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,850
vacuum back home. The reality is
that it grows out of a long

664
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:31,710
standing conflict with a 56 year
long occupation and no political

665
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,010
end in sight. I am deeply
distressed by today's

666
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:38,280
announcement that Israel will
initiate a complete seizure of

667
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:44,220
the Gaza Strip, nothing allowed
in no electricity, food or fuel.

668
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:49,410
Israel must see its legitimate
needs for security materialized,

669
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,890
and Palestinians must see a
clear perspective for the

670
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:58,230
establishment of their own state
realized only a negotiated peace

671
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,110
that fulfills the legitimate
national aspirations of

672
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:05,220
Palestinians and Israelis,
together with their security,

673
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,300
like the long held vision of a
two state solution in line with

674
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,990
the United Nations resolutions,
international law and previous

675
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:16,740
agreements can bring long term
stability to the people of these

676
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,460
lands and why the Middle East
region. Thank you.

677
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:25,950
Adam Curry: Yes, thank you very
much. Whatever same old sank you

678
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:32,040
saying that quick, biblical
reference. Matthew 24. This is

679
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,310
Jesus on the mound he says you
will hear of wars and rumors of

680
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:39,720
wars, but see to it that you are
not alarmed. Such things must

681
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,560
happen but the end is still to
come. Nation will rise against

682
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,580
nation and kingdom against
kingdom. So you know, as a as a

683
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,280
Christian, I'm like, Yeah, okay,
I guess maybe we're there. But

684
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,640
then comes this. There'll be
famines and earthquakes in

685
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,840
various places.

686
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:58,230
Unknown: There is another major
story developing overseas, at

687
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,800
least 2000 people have died. aid
after twin earthquakes in

688
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,370
Afghanistan near the border with
Iran, hundreds of people are

689
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,130
believed to be trapped in the
rubble. A lack of modern

690
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,920
equipment is hampering the
rescue efforts. No

691
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,750
Adam Curry: worries, all these
are the beginning of the birth

692
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,040
pains. Actually, it's

693
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,090
John C Dvorak: 3000

694
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:20,070
Adam Curry: years old report it
is at least two hours old. But

695
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,990
John C Dvorak: there's another
issue here that's not being

696
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:27,480
discussed in the West. And that
is war crimes which are apparent

697
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,640
by both sides.

698
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:35,280
Adam Curry: For me, it's just I
just want to say, war crimes to

699
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,900
me is the same as hate speech. I
mean, well, it's like, okay,

700
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,360
John C Dvorak: there are certain
specific things and I want to

701
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,950
play these three clips you got
it? Is War Crimes lead in Al

702
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:47,640
Jazeera.

703
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:51,300
Unknown: Petit Calhoun joins me
now from Washington, DC for more

704
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,870
on this and blinking on his way.
Now, what does the issue having

705
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,850
to achieve by going himself?

706
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,850
Well, first and foremost, it
sends the message, it backs up

707
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:03,270
with the President's words that
the US is fully behind Israel.

708
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,850
But there's going to be
discussions and one thing we've

709
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:09,900
noticed in the last 24 hours is
the US has really started to

710
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,770
shift focus to try and to get a
humanitarian corridor out of

711
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:17,220
Gaza. We he said on the tarmac,
that he's been speaking to

712
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,560
officials in Egypt. And in
Israel. He said it was

713
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,000
complicated. He didn't explain
exactly where the negotiations

714
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,240
were being held up. He wouldn't
answer that. But it is very

715
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,250
clear. And we're hearing this
from the White House from the

716
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:33,360
secretary of state that they are
pushing to have some way to get

717
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,290
civilians out of Gaza, get
Americans out, get civilians

718
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:41,040
out, they are working that and
they undoubtedly that is going

719
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,930
to be a huge part of the
conversation.

720
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,520
John C Dvorak: And that leads us
to the problem that that no one

721
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,850
wants to talk about in our
media. This is a clip to

722
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:54,060
Unknown: the end, Joe Biden has
just been holding a meeting with

723
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:57,540
Jewish leaders at the White
House. What did they have to

724
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,510
talk about? And did he make any
announcements off the back of

725
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:00,870
that?

726
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:05,160
Well, he actually moved the
needle a little bit. I watched

727
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,310
his speech just the other day.
And it was the full throated

728
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:12,090
angry, really emotional speech
from US President Joe Biden

729
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:15,030
about this. And some were
critical of him because he

730
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:18,000
didn't call for any sort of
restraint from Israel, it was a

731
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,210
full throated endorsement. We
were speaking to this group, he

732
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:24,360
told them he had spoken to
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin

733
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,200
Netanyahu, and that he told them
that he had even though people

734
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:34,290
are very angry that they have to
follow the rules of war. And so

735
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:38,640
that's seems to me to be putting
a baseline on what they expect

736
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,770
from these really operation. One
critical thing is, that would be

737
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:47,490
the civilian quarter because it
is against the laws of war two,

738
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:52,680
that blood civilians escaped and
also might call into question

739
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,010
that total blockade blockade of
Gaza. That is a war crime

740
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:59,790
according to all rules of law,
the Geneva Convention, so he's

741
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:04,890
17, possibly a subtle message to
Israel, that there is a there

742
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,290
are things that the US will not
condone.

743
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,520
John C Dvorak: This is going to
be a problem. You can't cordon

744
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,140
off an entire area and just
pummel them, and not allowing

745
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:19,650
them to escape that is a war
crime by any standards. As far

746
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,380
as I'm concerned. I don't think
it's like hate speech is really,

747
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:25,500
you just can't put someone in a
cage and then just bomb the shit

748
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,760
out of them. Because it's fun. I
have a I have a fact there's a

749
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,060
third,

750
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:34,110
Adam Curry: I want to give you
24 seconds. Because this this is

751
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:38,130
of course the problem. This is
from last year. This is fun to

752
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:39,810
lie in talking about Russia.

753
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,800
Unknown: Yesterday, we saw
again, Russia's targeted attacks

754
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,810
against civilian infrastructure,
targeted attacks on civilian

755
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:54,270
infrastructure with a clear aim
to cut off men, women, children

756
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:58,590
of water, electricity and
heating with winter coming.

757
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:03,660
These are acts of pure terror.
And we have to call it as such.

758
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:04,890
Okay,

759
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,240
John C Dvorak: excellent.

760
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,000
Adam Curry: To pull out of a hat
you get to call it that

761
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,680
sometimes I guess not always.

762
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,630
John C Dvorak: That was a good
one. Yeah. Okay. Well, here's

763
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,790
the final for these this war
crime stuff,

764
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,970
Unknown: and petty, can you just
give us a bit more of an idea

765
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:20,940
about what sort of military aid
the US is actually sending

766
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:21,510
Israel?

767
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:24,930
They are being incredibly vague.
As you know, I'm the defense

768
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,760
correspondents, I've been
speaking to people at the

769
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,330
Pentagon. And there was concern
even before this happened in

770
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:33,180
Israel, that they were going to
run out of ammunition. They've

771
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,300
been giving incredible amounts
of ammunition to Ukraine.

772
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,820
They've been trying to ramp up
production, but it obviously

773
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,900
takes time. This officials told
me on background that basically

774
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,130
yes, we believe we can give
Israel some of what it needs

775
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:49,500
because we've got stockpiles all
over the globe.

776
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:54,000
Adam Curry: Hold on a second.
All that we had left was cluster

777
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,900
munitions. Is that what we're
sending over now?

778
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:01,590
John C Dvorak: Dado No, in fact,
you Only LG zeros mentioned this

779
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,800
because we talk about on the
army is oh, we're, you're giving

780
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,530
him a we're sending some, you
know, some chips down there to

781
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,920
block to block the
Mediterranean, we're there. But

782
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,110
they don't say what you're
saying when we're sending them

783
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:17,640
delta zero tried to dig into it.
And they can't find out that we

784
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,520
don't know if it's cluster
munitions or if it's, you know,

785
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,940
bubblegum we have, there's no
idea. That said

786
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:25,890
Unknown: they've been very
vague. They said, We want to

787
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:30,720
give them Munitions for the Iron
Dome defense system, obviously.

788
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,570
And then other than that, they
really haven't given very many

789
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:38,070
details. Now, if Israel is were
to launch a ground invasion, it

790
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:42,300
is by far the most challenging
type of war for warfare in

791
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:47,010
existence, it is exceptionally
dangerous and deadly. So if the

792
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,190
Israel has decided what they
would do, likely with Secretary

793
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:52,680
Blinken, they're going over some
of those plans, some of the

794
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:55,620
finding out where some of those
shortfalls are. If they are

795
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,440
going to do a ground incursion,
in an incredibly densely

796
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,200
populated area with very narrow
streets, they'll need things

797
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,100
like night vision goggles,
they'll need ammunition perhaps

798
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,820
better, but body armor. So
really, they're I think, part of

799
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,250
trying to get a sense of where
Israel is going to take this and

800
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,840
what the US can do to help them.

801
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:16,110
Okay, thank you so much. That is
Petit Kelheim for us. In

802
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,220
Washington DC

803
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,550
Adam Curry: TRT had a report
about what's being sent and the

804
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,880
and what the US is doing to
support Israel. Here it is

805
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:27,210
Unknown: US President Joe Biden
called Hamas his attack on

806
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:31,710
Israel and atrocity on an
appalling scale, promised that

807
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:35,610
the US has Israel's back and
then issued a warning.

808
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,010
Let me say again, any country,
any organization, anyone

809
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:45,420
thinking of taking advantage of
situation? I have one word,

810
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,060
don't. Don't

811
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:49,860
Adam Curry: that's actually a
contraction. It's actually two

812
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,190
words.

813
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:57,930
John C Dvorak: But even so, even
so he said it twice. I have one

814
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:59,280
word, don't don't.

815
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,130
Unknown: March may be broken.
But our resolve is clear. Biden

816
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,730
tried to separate the
Palestinian people from Hamas.

817
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,700
Hamas does not stand for the
Palestinian people, by

818
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,960
Adam Curry: the way. I'm sorry.
This is our president now.

819
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:19,650
Unknown: I have one word don't.

820
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:24,449
Adam Curry: And our president
then I have two words for you.

821
00:47:25,049 --> 00:47:28,679
Predator drones. I mean, come
on. That was cool. Predator

822
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,029
drones. Two words

823
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:36,120
Unknown: don't. Our hearts may
be broken. But our resolve is

824
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:36,690
clear.

825
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:40,830
Biden tried to separate the
Palestinian people from Hamas.

826
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:44,279
Hamas does not stand for the
Palestinian people's right to

827
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:48,269
dignity and self determination.
Its stated purpose is

828
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:49,800
annihilation of the State of
Israel

829
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,150
on the murder of Jewish people.

830
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:54,630
National Security Adviser Jake
Sullivan says the death toll of

831
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:58,260
Americans killed in the Hamas
attack has grown to more than a

832
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:02,250
dozen with nearly two dozen
unaccounted for. But it's not

833
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:05,940
clear how many of those are
being held hostage by Hamas.

834
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,960
Sullivan said there are still no
plans to put US forces into the

835
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,430
conflicts and that for now, the
US is only helping Israel beef

836
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:18,330
up its Iron Dome defense shield
and providing expertise and

837
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:22,140
intelligence and sending a
flotilla of warships toward

838
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,820
Israel as a deterrent

839
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:28,440
Adam Curry: slay Flotilla. Isn't
a flotilla a certain amount.

840
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:32,159
John C Dvorak: Yeah, no.
Chicken. Nobody uses the term

841
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:35,309
flotilla they there's a term for
what they sent.

842
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:38,880
Adam Curry: Well, um, see
flotilla is like a bunch of

843
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:46,560
rafts. A small fleet of vessels
commercial or otherwise, he was

844
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,220
asked this

845
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:51,480
John C Dvorak: fleet, it's a big
fleet, aircraft carrier and a

846
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,160
bunch of destroyers small

847
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,170
Adam Curry: No, that's not a
flotilla. That's a fleet,

848
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,440
Unknown: but he was asked how
much of Israel's retaliation,

849
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:03,060
its destruction in Gaza is the
US willing to tolerate?

850
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:06,600
I don't think of this in terms
of retaliation. This is about

851
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:11,040
providing support to Israel as
it seeks to defend its territory

852
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,310
and deal with an ongoing
imminent threat from Hamas

853
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:15,000
terrorists.

854
00:49:15,029 --> 00:49:18,299
Still, the Biden administration
is talking to officials in

855
00:49:18,299 --> 00:49:21,689
Israel and Egypt, about
providing a safe passage to

856
00:49:21,689 --> 00:49:25,739
Palestinians, perhaps through
Egypt, even though Egypt has

857
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:29,579
been reluctant in the past to
open up its Gaza border to them.

858
00:49:29,879 --> 00:49:33,299
And that is sure to be one of
the topics when US Secretary of

859
00:49:33,299 --> 00:49:37,079
State Antony Blinken arrives in
Israel later this week. Oh,

860
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:37,319
that's

861
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,570
Adam Curry: all you need. You
need Blinken that's just sent

862
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:41,370
Newland. That'll make it even
when they didn't

863
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:44,610
John C Dvorak: send that report.
What you you you falsely

864
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:47,940
promoted Oh, I had the floods.
They didn't say what they said

865
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,730
some some parts for that. No,
no, no. I

866
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:53,070
Adam Curry: said that. They
tried to get the answer to this.

867
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:53,760
So they also

868
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:57,030
John C Dvorak: can't get the
answer except the parts I

869
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:01,920
Raytheon. Apparently scutts
should send Some stuff. So that

870
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,860
part's at the further end,
because nobody else is using

871
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,990
this, you know, these patriots

872
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:10,680
Adam Curry: this is. So this is
how I'm going to view this

873
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:15,300
conflict and what happens for
the next period of time. I mean,

874
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:20,490
I, I do not think this is going
to end swiftly, it's going to

875
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:26,400
expand, just like COVID. Just
like 911. Really, this is a

876
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,960
liquid liquidity event. And
we're in more need of it than

877
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,110
ever, I would say, I don't know
much about the public markets.

878
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:39,750
But I see the issue with
everyone going into bonds. All

879
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,390
of a sudden, by on Friday,
everything reversed the dollar

880
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:45,420
started. This is before this
attack happened. The dollar

881
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,930
reversed, the bond yields
started to go down stocks were

882
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:51,960
looking more attractive. All the
Fed presidents were coming out

883
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,900
egg economy's great,
everything's good, then this

884
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,350
happens. And for that we had a
little blip there where Oh,

885
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,870
everyone's all our stocks are
gonna go up. And I think today

886
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:04,920
it's down again. So we need
money. The military industrial

887
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:10,320
complex needs money. Right now
we're in a shutdown situation.

888
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,830
So they couldn't get the 24
billion they want it for

889
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:19,740
Ukraine, then I'm I'm I mean,
it's so obvious. So so obvious

890
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:23,460
that that how much money is
going to be created for this? I

891
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,250
don't think we have a war chest
per se. I don't think we have

892
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,100
anything. I mean, what we have
stuff for everybody.

893
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,790
John C Dvorak: Like that one
report said they got stockpiles

894
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,590
all over the world. Yeah. Well,

895
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:37,050
Adam Curry: we didn't have it
for Ukraine. But I think I

896
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:40,950
think, you know, we're gonna go
into money printing mode. And

897
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:43,650
the markets needed the banks
need it. It's hard. I'm so

898
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:47,370
happy. We don't have a cap on on
our honored on our national

899
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:51,690
debt. With that, that's
convenient that there's no

900
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:56,850
statutory debt at the moment, as
you know, no ceiling. And then

901
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:02,910
of course, even though I truly
believe this, truly, here's some

902
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:07,260
here's some disinformation that
came out. But actually falls

903
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:11,490
right, it leads it folds into
this topic of money for the

904
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:14,850
military industrial complex. So
going on whenever you see a clip

905
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:19,320
that is 12 or 15 seconds long.
That is an oh my god, I can't

906
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:22,710
believe it. You shouldn't show
that. Oh, my God, I can't

907
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:25,800
believe it clip that's been
going around is a Rear Admiral

908
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:32,940
Kirby of the the National
Security Council. Say, here's,

909
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:36,900
here's the headline on the
tweet, we're leaving you we're

910
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,230
gonna we're gonna step away from
Ukraine. No more funding for

911
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:42,330
Ukraine. Look here. He said
anything

912
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:44,400
Unknown: funny. We're, we're
coming near to the end of the

913
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,840
rope. I mean, today we announced
$200 million. And we'll keep

914
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,990
that aid going as long as we
can. But it's it's not going to

915
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:52,860
be indefinite. So

916
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,770
Adam Curry: it's not going to be
indefinite. Oh, no, that's it.

917
00:52:55,770 --> 00:53:00,330
We're ending? We're ending
support for Ukraine? No, no, it

918
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:03,930
is quite the opposite. He is
pleading for more money for

919
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,850
everything. Here's the full
minute,

920
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,070
Unknown: can you provide us
anything on a timeline or give

921
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:11,400
us a sense of how quickly the US
would exhaust what it can

922
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,840
provide to Israel before

923
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,840
congressional actions and
existing authorities and

924
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:20,760
appropriations to support Israel
in the near term? And I got

925
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,220
asked last time, you know, what
is near term? Or what's a bit

926
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:27,420
mean? I, I can't give you a date
calendar, because a lot of it's

927
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,280
going to depend on their
expenditure rate, and what the

928
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,700
replenishment ability is, what
the need is and what our ability

929
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,970
to do it is. But in the near
term, we've we've got

930
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:39,780
appropriations and authorities
for both Ukraine and for Israel.

931
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:45,360
For both, you don't want to be
trying to bake in long term

932
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:50,250
support. When you're at the end
of the rope and the in Ukraine,

933
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,980
on the Ukraine funding. We're,
we're coming near to the end of

934
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:57,090
the rope. I mean, today we
announced $200 million. And

935
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:00,300
we'll keep that aid going as
long as we can. But it's it's

936
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,820
not going to be indefinite. So
are we moving with a sense of

937
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,070
alacrity? Absolutely. I couldn't
give you a date certain on the

938
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:05,460
calendar.

939
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:08,550
Adam Curry: So no, no, what he's
saying is not worth stepping

940
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:11,580
away from Ukraine. No, we're
doubling down. We need more for

941
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,840
Ukraine. We Yes.

942
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:16,110
John C Dvorak: Actually, the
point you made about if you see

943
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:19,950
a 15 second clip going around, I
see these all the time, and I'm

944
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:23,190
always trying to find the
original. Yeah. Which is what we

945
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:25,950
both do. But when you see
something like that going

946
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:30,900
around, yeah, it's taken out of
context to fool you. Yes. And

947
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,360
all you have to do is do a
little digging, and I don't know

948
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,830
why nobody, nobody but this show
seems to do that. So now let's

949
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:41,400
head it's really remarkable to
me since we only had 41 people

950
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,950
out of the almost million people
that listen to the show that

951
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:47,040
even bothered to contribute over
$50 for this particular show,

952
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:49,590
Adam Curry: you know, we could
we could turn the cameras on,

953
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:52,860
boasted here with headphones,
and then talk about the outrage

954
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:56,160
of the babies. And we're going
to bomb them though. Yeah, we'd

955
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:01,590
make twice we make twice as much
money if not more. So, two

956
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:05,580
theaters we're going to add to
this. We don't have to go too

957
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:09,540
deep into it. But you probably
heard about the pipeline, the

958
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:16,290
Finland gas pipeline. Well, it
looks like that was some

959
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:20,790
terrorism. Someone blew up that
pipeline. Of course, Finland is

960
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:25,140
a brand new NATO member, what
are the chances? So outcomes?

961
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:29,910
Jens Stoltenberg, the head
honcho of NATO was the Lensky

962
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:34,410
literally standing next to him
like a little boy. And here's

963
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:35,460
what yen says

964
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:40,170
Unknown: we will also address
the incident in the Baltic Sea,

965
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:45,210
with the damage caused to
critical undersea

966
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,990
infrastructure. I spoke with
Preston Salvini minister and

967
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:52,890
Prime Minister Carlos yesterday,
and we are in close contact

968
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:56,730
important thing now is to
establish what happened and how

969
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:01,290
this could happen. If it is
proven to be a deliberate attack

970
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:04,950
on a NATO critical
infrastructure, then this will

971
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:10,200
be of course serious, but it
will also be met by a united and

972
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:12,810
determined response from NATO

973
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:16,770
Adam Curry: Article Five because
was Finland is now a NATO

974
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:20,850
country. So if someone did
anything to that pipeline, Putin

975
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:24,570
if anyone did some of that
pipeline Oh, Article Five

976
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:25,920
response so we have

977
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:29,850
John C Dvorak: all a different
idea. What if it was Lewinsky's

978
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:32,610
boys the Ukrainians who did
something to that pipeline just

979
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:36,030
to stir things up? And we find
out that it was them do it? Does

980
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:37,260
NATO attack them now?

981
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:42,870
Adam Curry: Dream on Dream?
Dream on? No, we want more wars.

982
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:47,940
War is good for business. It's
good for business. And now the

983
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:52,560
final frontier besides sadly, I
think Lebanon is there's not

984
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:57,540
much to realize in Lebanon
anymore. But you know, I it's on

985
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:00,510
the west Clarke seven lists so
we'll just we'll just add it

986
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:01,800
there. That wouldn't take much.

987
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:03,600
John C Dvorak: I do have
actually a couple of clips

988
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,050
regarding the Hezbollah attack
from Lebanon. Let's do that.

989
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:11,190
Let's do that. This is habitable
attack at this is not what you

990
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:14,310
hear from any of our media.
Again, I have to go to Al

991
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:18,360
Jazeera English for this. This
is Hezbollah attack one

992
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,360
Unknown: of the Israeli army is
trying to calm fears after a

993
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,240
false alarms and people
nationwide scrambling for

994
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:24,810
shelter.

995
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:34,290
warning sirens rang out across
northern Israel and flares were

996
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:37,530
fired at the border. As people
across the country were told to

997
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:41,100
seek shelter over a possible
aerial infiltration from

998
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:45,030
Lebanon. The army now says the
Panic was caused by human error.

999
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:49,140
Only Hashem is in the town of
Nakota human error and Lebanon

1000
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,460
near the border with Israel.

1001
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:56,310
Today was a very hectic day. It
started with Hezbollah attack on

1002
00:57:56,370 --> 00:58:02,610
Israeli troops on the borders,
mainly in the HERA village on

1003
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:06,450
the border line. According to
the pictures we saw from

1004
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:11,070
Hezbollah, it seems that there
was a direct hit with guided

1005
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:16,230
missiles. Now following that
Israeli assaulted shelling, the

1006
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:20,820
villages surrounding the
borders, and there were two

1007
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:25,590
people injured. Now, later on,
this alarm came and there were

1008
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:30,960
these reports about planes,
paragliders crossing towards the

1009
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:38,070
border. However, there was no
genuine reason to understand why

1010
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:42,420
this alarm is coming out because
none of these product gliders

1011
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:47,940
were seen with eyes. Also, at
the same time, these product

1012
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:52,800
gliders, the alleged panic
gliders did not engage in a

1013
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,400
battle or in the fight on the
ground. So later on, it was

1014
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:59,160
clarified that this is not
right.

1015
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:03,660
Adam Curry: This is interesting.
This paraglider thing paramotor

1016
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:07,140
ultralight everyone's using
different words for it. It's

1017
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:10,470
it's also a 911 throwback to
these guys couldn't even fly a

1018
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:14,310
Cessna. And they flew these
planes into buildings. Oh, look,

1019
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:17,070
they're coming over a little
paragliders and they're causing

1020
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:21,330
havoc. It's all a just a
different verse. It's like a

1021
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:23,250
reboot of cheers.

1022
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,990
John C Dvorak: Whatever the case
is, the non existent paragliders

1023
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:32,520
that part clipped to indicate
that the Israelis are actually

1024
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:36,300
pounding the southern border of
Lebanon as we speak.

1025
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:41,880
Unknown: However, the Israeli
army continued to launch fleurs

1026
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:47,790
in the skies of South Lebanon,
also burning the bushes around

1027
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:53,310
the borders in order to deny any
fighters. Kind of a cover just

1028
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:57,240
in case they're trying to
infiltrate the border. So it was

1029
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,600
a it was a hectic day for
Israel. The troops on the

1030
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:05,640
Lebanese side and this clarified
the situation whereas the

1031
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:11,130
tension is mounting day after
day. So, in comparison with

1032
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:15,360
yesterday when rockets were
launched and hummus, Al Qassam

1033
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:19,320
brigades claimed responsibility
or the day before where a group

1034
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:22,500
from Islamic Jihad infiltrated
the borders and engage in a

1035
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:26,820
battle with Israelis. Today was
the bigger day. And it seems

1036
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,520
that this tension is going to
continue. It's not going to

1037
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,420
stop. And at least from what I
understand this is going to

1038
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:38,100
continue as far as the campaign
on Gaza is going to continue to

1039
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:38,670
continue.

1040
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:44,040
Adam Curry: Oh, man, peanuts.
This is the peanuts part in the

1041
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:49,140
background. We need to slowly
ramp up Iran. This is the prize.

1042
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,320
This is the big one. This is
what and it would be would it be

1043
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:59,610
any better to have Israel attack
Iran with our weapons? We wish

1044
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,280
John C Dvorak: that that would
have to be what that would have

1045
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:02,880
to be it

1046
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:09,420
Adam Curry: and the Washington
Post Robo WaPo has Iran on their

1047
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:13,710
mind. So we had Chuck Schumer,
Senator Schumer went to talk to

1048
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:17,190
President GE, as the
representative of the United

1049
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:21,150
States, our president can't get
a meeting with him. So send the

1050
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:25,650
next best thing. And so here's a
question from WaPo. Journal. He

1051
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:28,440
asked a question about GE. But
he also asked he slips into

1052
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,290
question about Iran, the answer
is somewhat surprising.

1053
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:32,999
Unknown: Thank you very much.
Just following up on what you

1054
01:01:32,999 --> 01:01:35,849
just said. How did they respond
specifically on the point of

1055
01:01:35,849 --> 01:01:38,549
Iran? How did President Xi
respond on that? And more

1056
01:01:38,549 --> 01:01:43,919
broadly, if I could just ask a
broader question? Many analysts

1057
01:01:43,919 --> 01:01:46,529
cite a lack of trust between the
US and China as one of the

1058
01:01:46,529 --> 01:01:48,899
biggest stumbling blocks to
better ties between the

1059
01:01:48,899 --> 01:01:52,109
countries after meeting with
President Xi today, do you trust

1060
01:01:52,109 --> 01:01:53,459
him more or less than

1061
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:58,590
let me just say this, both
sides, the Chinese and us said,

1062
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:01,440
unless we have sincere
conversations about our

1063
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,090
differences, and not pull any
punches, that we would never

1064
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:09,810
solve these problems. And the
thing that I think we respected

1065
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:13,800
is the Chinese leadership from
President Xi on down understood

1066
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,110
that we were going to be strong
understood that we're going to

1067
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:19,740
be tough, but also understood
that's a necessity if we're ever

1068
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:22,950
going to improve the
relationship. On the first

1069
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:23,940
question he listened.

1070
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:27,450
Adam Curry: Now listen to to
Schumer not having the answer,

1071
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:29,730
but his handlers giving him the
answer.

1072
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:33,480
Unknown: I don't recall him
saying anything specific on it,

1073
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,750
but he listened several times
deliver the message. Go ahead.

1074
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:40,410
They said they would deliver the
message to the Iranians. Yes.

1075
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,980
Adam Curry: Okay. Okay. They
said they would deliver the

1076
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:50,160
message to the Iranians. So WaPo
has Iran in their sights WaPo, I

1077
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:54,390
would say is compromised. They
just fire they just fired 10% of

1078
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:57,570
their workforce. They fired 200
people for whatever reason.

1079
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:03,840
There is a scandal brewing. The
Special Envoy to Iran from the

1080
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,500
US State Department, Robert
Malley has kind of disappeared.

1081
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:11,430
He was supposed to show up in
some hearings, and you know, he

1082
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:15,300
couldn't make it and now he's
gone away, and we don't know

1083
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:21,090
where he is. And oh, WaPo has
intercepted some emails and

1084
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:25,920
communications between him one
of his fellow State Department

1085
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:29,460
or former State Department
workers now at the Pentagon with

1086
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:35,970
Iran. It turns out, we had an
Iranian spy in the State

1087
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:40,140
Department. Remember, now
there's all this noise about

1088
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:45,060
Donald Trump leaking the plans
to attack Iran? No, that's then

1089
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:48,120
he had it and then someone else
had it and who knows who had it,

1090
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:51,570
but WaPo and this has been going
on for a few weeks. No one's

1091
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:56,460
really talking about it. This is
Michael Christianson. He's he

1092
01:03:56,790 --> 01:04:01,500
he's on bitchute. So you're no,
you're no, it's good. And he

1093
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,550
gives us a brief overview of
what's happening with the

1094
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:10,200
special envoy. And the spies.
The Iranian spies in the State

1095
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,730
Department. Iran is bad

1096
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,760
Unknown: right about the same
time Malley was under suspicion.

1097
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:19,230
Wow. Sensitive US government
documents started showing up in

1098
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:23,280
Iran state media, so our top
Iran guide disappears for

1099
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:26,790
mishandling classified
information and classified

1100
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:30,270
information starts showing up in
Iranian government hands. It's

1101
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:34,380
not hard to deduce what happened
here. But this new report adds

1102
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:39,210
detail Robert Malley wasn't
really our top Iran guy. He was

1103
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:42,780
actually a Ron's top America
guy. According to the report in

1104
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:46,110
the emails It cites Robert
Malley was funding supporting

1105
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:49,560
and directing an Iranian
intelligence operation designed

1106
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:53,130
to influence the United States.
This project was called the

1107
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:57,690
Iranian experts initiative. So
the experts strike again through

1108
01:04:57,690 --> 01:05:01,530
it. The Iranian government was
recruiting Western academics,

1109
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,010
meeting them abroad to receive
their loyalty and issue

1110
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:08,400
directions for how to influence
the US government. Though of

1111
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,850
course eventually it wasn't just
influence that Robert Malley

1112
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:15,300
achieved at the State
Department. It was a job at the

1113
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:19,230
highest level crafting Iran
policy and Robert Malley brought

1114
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:23,610
his Iranian experts initiative
friends to the administration to

1115
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:26,790
so while Malley is now
officially out on leave, there's

1116
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:30,420
still at least one more in a
high level position. Who isn't

1117
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:34,380
the emails in the report show a
woman named Aryan Tabata by is

1118
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,860
also a part of this Iranian
influence network who is Tabata

1119
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:41,910
by Well, she's a person Robert
Malley, personally brought into

1120
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:44,880
Biden's administration. She was
first at the State Department.

1121
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:48,810
She was a diplomat on Melis iran
nuclear negotiation team under

1122
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:52,410
Biden, and now she works at the
Pentagon, where she's currently

1123
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:56,010
the Chief of Staff for the
Assistant Secretary of Defense

1124
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,910
for special operations. So not
only did she negotiate with

1125
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:03,960
hostels while being part of a
propaganda network for those

1126
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,140
hostels, she's now working with
our SpecOps who of course,

1127
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:10,980
handle our most risky and
difficult military operations

1128
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:14,520
should any heightened conflict
arise, emails were covered by

1129
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,770
the Wall Street Journal
reporters showed Tabata by

1130
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:20,280
consulting with and seeking
advice from Iran's foreign

1131
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,640
ministry before attending policy
events. Before she gave

1132
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:27,840
congressional testimony in 2014.
She asked an Iranian official

1133
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:31,620
for advice on how to deal with
other witnesses, who are Iran

1134
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:34,560
critics, she sent in a run
sympathetic article she

1135
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:38,190
published in The Boston Globe to
this Iranian official for praise

1136
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:41,520
and recognition. And also in
these emails. The Iranian

1137
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,180
government was very pleased with
the results of their project.

1138
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:48,930
Adam Curry: So if you want
something to crack open view,

1139
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:52,680
call your friends at WaPo it's
coming to the it's coming up.

1140
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:56,550
It's gonna bubble up. We've got
Mohamed de F. I guarantee you

1141
01:06:56,550 --> 01:07:00,000
he'll show up in Iran. Oh, yeah.
We found him we are smoke them

1142
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,300
out.

1143
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,430
John C Dvorak: The whole thing
of these people go back to the

1144
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:14,880
to the very middle east centric
Obama administration. And yeah,

1145
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,270
this spy network is quite funny.
It's it was written up in a

1146
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:22,800
couple of different places.
Nobody knows quite what to make

1147
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:23,250
of it.

1148
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:28,140
Adam Curry: Don't worry, it'll
it'll be twisted into something.

1149
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:32,910
But it's Iran is bad. Iran,
Iran, Iran, Iran, Iran, let

1150
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:36,210
Israel do it. It all has to
leave everyone saying it. Every

1151
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:39,510
report. The anti Defamation
League, obviously Iran,

1152
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:44,850
Hezbollah, Iran, Hamas. Iran is
all around. We've got to go out

1153
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:49,290
we got to go with the route
swung out. The one eyed one

1154
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:52,320
legged guy who planned it all
he's in Iran, you can just wait

1155
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:52,740
for it.

1156
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,990
John C Dvorak: Wait, if that
happens, I'm gonna give you 10

1157
01:07:54,990 --> 01:08:00,120
points because that would be
ideal. We should also meet the

1158
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,650
whole thing's a scam.

1159
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,800
Adam Curry: Well, this is what I
believe is it's a scam the

1160
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:09,510
military industrial complex.
It's for politics. It's being

1161
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:13,170
used for is getting all of the
bad news off of the front line.

1162
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:18,900
Even the bad news about you the
Ukraine conflict. Everything is

1163
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:21,870
just off the table. Don't worry
about it. I was

1164
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:24,900
John C Dvorak: hooked by this by
the way. As you can tell by my

1165
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:30,990
clips. There was no way of
getting any other news except

1166
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:33,150
this story clip custodian

1167
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:37,110
Adam Curry: sent me his normal
batch is like it's all Israel.

1168
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:41,040
John C Dvorak: I did get some of
the stories. I mean, a few of

1169
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:44,010
them here and there, but they're
all They're all minor. Well,

1170
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:47,880
there's one. There's one other
thing about the hunter Biden's

1171
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:50,820
This is the real kicker to me is
the hunter Biden's all of a

1172
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:53,040
sudden completely opted out. Of
course,

1173
01:08:53,069 --> 01:08:55,229
Adam Curry: of course, you're
he's back to smoking crack and

1174
01:08:55,229 --> 01:09:00,389
hookers is all it was, Oh, good.
Good for him. So now this is

1175
01:09:00,389 --> 01:09:06,689
also a perfect opportunity to
enact and try out some of the

1176
01:09:06,689 --> 01:09:11,429
new regulation in the European
Union DSA, the digital services

1177
01:09:11,459 --> 01:09:17,009
agreement. Which Well, it's
actually in this report. But

1178
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:22,979
spoiler alert, if if you find if
you're a platform and you find

1179
01:09:22,979 --> 01:09:27,629
hate speech, or disinformation,
you have to remove it

1180
01:09:27,629 --> 01:09:30,569
immediately. letters went out
letters went out to Elon Musk

1181
01:09:30,569 --> 01:09:33,659
letters went out to Mark
Zuckerberg there's bad things on

1182
01:09:33,659 --> 01:09:36,929
your platform that will not
stand in the European Union. As

1183
01:09:36,929 --> 01:09:37,409
violence

1184
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:40,740
Unknown: rages in Israel and
Gaza sued as fake news on social

1185
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:45,330
media. The US making urgent
appeal to big tech, in a letter

1186
01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:49,110
addressed and met a CEO Mark
Zuckerberg on Wednesday. Anyway,

1187
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:51,780
it's on the blocks industry
chief urged the platform to do

1188
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:56,040
more to curb disinformation or
face penalties curb it comes a

1189
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:00,300
day after Viton made a similar
call to ex owner Elon Musk As

1190
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,000
the source of the war social
media networks have been awash

1191
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,790
with graphic images and
misinformation linked to the

1192
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:09,690
violence, the fact checkers at
Frost 24 They've been debunking

1193
01:10:09,690 --> 01:10:13,710
some of the forces under the
aegis Digital Services Act, and

1194
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:17,070
our social media platforms like
x are obliged to stop the spread

1195
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:20,520
of harmful content, or face
fines of up to 6% of their

1196
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:24,750
annual global revenue. Instead,
experts say that x is algorithm

1197
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:27,630
is actively promoting
disinformation on the Israel

1198
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:31,050
Hamas war. Favoring posts by
accounts that pay for its blue

1199
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:34,050
check subscription service,
regardless of who runs them.

1200
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:38,160
Users can receive payments under
the scheme, giving them more

1201
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:41,310
incentive to publish posts that
are unlikely to elicit strong

1202
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:42,840
reactions and go viral.

1203
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:46,230
On a request for a comment made
by CNBC a meta spokesperson,

1204
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:50,250
spokesperson said we quickly
established a special operations

1205
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,950
center staffed with experts
including fluent Hebrew and

1206
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:56,970
Arabic speakers to monitor and
respond to this rapidly evolving

1207
01:10:56,970 --> 01:11:00,630
situation. Our teams are working
around the clock to keep our

1208
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:03,990
platforms safe, take action on
content that violates our

1209
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:07,170
policies or local law and
coordinate with third party fact

1210
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:11,460
checkers in the region factual
information. And there was also

1211
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:17,400
a statement by ex CEO Linda
Yakko. Reno shortly just a few

1212
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,700
minutes ago, saying that shortly
after the news broke about Hamas

1213
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:24,570
attack X assembled leadership, a
leadership group to assess the

1214
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:28,230
situation. Since the terrorist
attack on Israel, we've taken

1215
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:33,420
action to remove or label 10s of
1000s of pieces of content. So

1216
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:36,120
far since the start of the
conflicts ex says it has

1217
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:39,360
identified and removed hundreds
of Hamas affiliated accounts

1218
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:40,890
from their platform.

1219
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:44,610
Adam Curry: Oh, of course, only
Hamas has disinformation, we go

1220
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:49,920
to our DSA dashboard. Last time
we checked in with the DSA, the

1221
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:56,970
Digital Services Act. We had
about 67,000 takedowns an hour.

1222
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:03,330
Do you care to wager what it's
up to now? Joe? Quarter of a

1223
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:13,350
million now not quite 137,630.
Now 137,630? Yes, there we go.

1224
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:20,040
per hour, over five hour per
hour? Over 5 million takedowns a

1225
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:20,700
day.

1226
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:24,360
John C Dvorak: Others taking
everything down?

1227
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:29,010
Adam Curry: My point? Exactly.
So what you are seeing is only

1228
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:36,090
approved. It's only approved
narrative. I think we can we can

1229
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:41,430
easily presume that. So you're
not getting anything from social

1230
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:42,060
media.

1231
01:12:42,089 --> 01:12:43,979
John C Dvorak: You're getting
nothing from the sounds of it.

1232
01:12:43,979 --> 01:12:48,599
If you're taking down 100 A
quarter well, not a quarter of a

1233
01:12:48,599 --> 01:12:54,089
million to a million per hour.
That's a lot of posts. That

1234
01:12:54,089 --> 01:12:57,089
means every eight hours a
million posts are taken down.

1235
01:12:57,089 --> 01:13:02,489
It's a million posts a lot. It's
an it's an eight hours and yet

1236
01:13:02,489 --> 01:13:07,769
24 hours is three. That's you
know, it's 3 million a day. It's

1237
01:13:07,769 --> 01:13:15,929
ridiculous. Yeah. I know. So
there too, so it has to be willy

1238
01:13:15,929 --> 01:13:18,689
nilly. Your way? Well, no,

1239
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:21,570
Adam Curry: it's it's it's
complaint from the government

1240
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:26,250
take it down. Okay. Nothing has
changed. Nothing has changed.

1241
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:31,770
The I just I'd say the the
agents are still inside of x.

1242
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:37,830
And everywhere else. Platforms
are no good. Although I do like

1243
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:41,520
kind of the insinuation that,
that x is the worst because they

1244
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:46,620
pay people with blue checkmarks
for for posts. If you know

1245
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:49,920
that's the Yeah, the Twitter X

1246
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:53,370
John C Dvorak: payments, pave
eight bucks and you get a blue

1247
01:13:53,370 --> 01:13:53,910
checkmark.

1248
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:56,220
Adam Curry: Yeah, but no, but
then you can join their

1249
01:13:56,220 --> 01:14:00,930
monetization program. And yeah,
if you get people commenting on

1250
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:04,860
your post, and they're able to
sell ads, boom, you get some

1251
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:05,280
money.

1252
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:06,420
John C Dvorak: I'm doing it

1253
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,210
Adam Curry: that tell me this
isn't an old story, just talking

1254
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:19,260
about big tech for a second.
Somehow I feel like this story

1255
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:21,900
we've heard I couldn't find a
clip but we've heard it before

1256
01:14:21,929 --> 01:14:24,839
Unknown: Amazon's Alexa has
apparently been claiming the

1257
01:14:24,839 --> 01:14:29,279
2020 presidential election was
stolen. The voice assistants

1258
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:32,399
cites various sources when
answering questions about the

1259
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:35,999
election, including from a video
streaming service popular with

1260
01:14:35,999 --> 01:14:39,539
conservatives called rumble.
multiple investigations

1261
01:14:39,539 --> 01:14:42,569
uncovered no evidence of
election fraud and Amazon says

1262
01:14:42,569 --> 01:14:46,409
for their part responses were
errors delivered a small number

1263
01:14:46,409 --> 01:14:47,939
of times and quickly

1264
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:48,570
fixed.

1265
01:14:49,469 --> 01:14:50,759
Adam Curry: Why do I think I've
heard this

1266
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,370
John C Dvorak: story before I
never heard this story before.

1267
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:57,300
Adam Curry: I'm used to it must
be must be.

1268
01:14:57,509 --> 01:14:59,639
John C Dvorak: Yeah, you really
have a memory for this and so

1269
01:14:59,639 --> 01:15:02,669
you should Have it maybe it
floated arrive I was

1270
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:05,610
Adam Curry: looking for a clip I
could not find a clip. I do have

1271
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:08,280
a couple quick big tech things
unless you want to stay in in

1272
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:08,940
the region.

1273
01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:12,480
John C Dvorak: We'll get to
Hizbollah tap run down

1274
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:15,570
Adam Curry: the region are we
still stuck in the real region

1275
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:17,580
the region in the region?

1276
01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:20,430
John C Dvorak: West Bank killing
so this is kind of interesting

1277
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:22,830
here. There's a shooting people
in the West Bank, which got

1278
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:29,490
nothing to do with Gaza. But
okay. Where is it? It's just

1279
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:32,640
war. West Bank.

1280
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:35,730
Unknown: More Israeli settlers
have killed at least four

1281
01:15:35,730 --> 01:15:39,180
Palestinians and attacks on the
village south of Nablus in the

1282
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:42,570
occupied West Bank. The
Palestinian health ministry says

1283
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:46,200
Israeli forces have also killed
a 16 year old boy near Hebron.

1284
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:50,640
29 Palestinians have been killed
in the occupied West Bank since

1285
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,080
the war began on Saturday.

1286
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:58,500
John C Dvorak: Yeah, I was gonna
body. The other one as I want to

1287
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:01,560
play this. This is a protest for
Palestinians in the EU and how

1288
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,500
it kind of contrast with what
we're doing here in the United

1289
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:05,040
States.

1290
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:08,070
Unknown: But French police in
the city of Leon used force to

1291
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:11,040
break up a demonstration in
support of Palestinians on

1292
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,430
Wednesday. It comes after a
decision by city officials to

1293
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:17,760
ban gatherings local activists
had planned for later in the

1294
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,810
week. Authorities in Paris have
also imposed prohibitions on pro

1295
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:25,740
Palestinian marches. French
President Emmanuel Macron has

1296
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:29,730
condemned Hamas as attack on
Israel, but opposes stopping the

1297
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:34,410
European Union's humanitarian
assistance to Palestinians. Pro

1298
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:37,980
Palestinian demonstrations have
also been taking place in the

1299
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:42,030
German capital Berlin with a
large police presence. Melissa

1300
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:43,170
Chan has more.

1301
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:46,950
Police have just told everyone
in the area to disperse they

1302
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:50,910
have banned all Palestinian
solidarity protests over the

1303
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:55,110
next few days. Particularly in
Germany, this is a touchy

1304
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:58,200
subject because of the history
of the country, the history of

1305
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,650
World War Two and the Nazis the
Holocaust, which means that the

1306
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:04,530
German government and the German
people, many of them consider

1307
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:08,670
something as simple as waving
the Palestinian flag as anti

1308
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:09,540
semitic.

1309
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:15,180
Just you know, this is always
the flag and all German

1310
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:19,260
arguments to denounce and
actually persecute Palestinian

1311
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:21,840
voices for the rights in
Palestine

1312
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:25,440
also have the right to do
whatever they want. They have

1313
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,110
been paying for 75 years and
that's not okay.

1314
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:30,690
Now over the next few days,
emotions are going to run high.

1315
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:34,260
There's also a big Israeli
community here. And police say

1316
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:36,900
one reason why they're banning
protests is to prevent the two

1317
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:39,870
sides from clashing. Melissa
Chan, Al Jazeera

1318
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,330
Adam Curry: Berlin. It's all
it's all meant to Trump to

1319
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,220
trigger trauma. And when

1320
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:46,890
John C Dvorak: you're done that
was your basic thesis and I

1321
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:49,470
think you're ready. One last
clip for this kind of thing.

1322
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:52,800
There's the Democrats no support
for Israel. Just from New Tang

1323
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:53,490
Dynasty,

1324
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,250
Unknown: some Democrats for your
support for Israel among their

1325
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:59,850
party might be waning. This
comes as some lawmakers voiced

1326
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:02,700
support for Palestine while
others are distancing

1327
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:03,570
themselves.

1328
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:09,930
Some Democrats reportedly fear
that members of their party

1329
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:13,800
might stop supporting Israel
sentiments in the US in the past

1330
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:17,640
few days since the attacks were
mostly pro Israel, however, that

1331
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:21,300
might change. One unnamed
Democratic lawmaker told

1332
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:24,480
Politico for the last couple of
days, we've seen all the

1333
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,150
pictures of girls who were
killed at this festival and the

1334
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:30,840
children. The lawmaker says this
will change now as the counter

1335
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,100
offensive begins.

1336
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:35,100
Adam Curry: Have you actually
I've been honest, it is part of

1337
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:38,580
research. I have looked Have you
seen a lot of people killed at

1338
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:42,660
the festival? I'm not disputing
it. But have we actually seen

1339
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:43,560
that I've seen

1340
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:47,010
John C Dvorak: there's once
there's one telegraph telegram

1341
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:50,310
site that has all these
pictures, it's it's pretty

1342
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:53,580
elaborate, and it does hundreds
and hundreds of pictures. But

1343
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:57,600
specifically from that festival
No, no, I've not seen anything

1344
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:57,960
either.

1345
01:18:57,990 --> 01:19:00,300
Adam Curry: Because they just
reported that they've that

1346
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:04,560
they've seen that. And it's you
know, it's like the base. Yeah,

1347
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:07,860
I'm not disputing it, but but I
have not seen the pictures. And

1348
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:12,450
you and the newsletter you sent
out was, but it was on point. It

1349
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:12,870
will might

1350
01:19:12,930 --> 01:19:17,130
John C Dvorak: lie. I played up
to the bullshit pictures and

1351
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:20,340
somebody sent me I did get a
note for somebody regarding that

1352
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:23,400
girl that they kept showing over
and over and over again to being

1353
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,520
taken out of the back of a jeep
and then being put in the front

1354
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,120
of the Jeep

1355
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:32,430
Adam Curry: which which which I
saw MSNBC claiming she was raped

1356
01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:35,820
and she was bleeding like you
have no evidence of that I when

1357
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:38,460
I saw that first and I'm sorry
that you know to bring up this

1358
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:41,820
is traumatic to see it. It to me
it looked like someone who

1359
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:44,700
crapped their pants because they
were so terrified. That's what

1360
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:49,590
it looked like to me or any
other many reasons but it was

1361
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:50,700
presented as so

1362
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,650
John C Dvorak: she could have
been sitting in blood to foil

1363
01:19:52,650 --> 01:19:56,430
you know, it was presented as
fact. No, and then they had this

1364
01:19:56,430 --> 01:20:01,740
guy who seemed to be in
blackface for some reason. He

1365
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:06,960
shoots a gun in the air, pulls
her out of the back yells. Akbar

1366
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,470
shoots a gun and then puts her
in the in the seat in the comfy

1367
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:14,040
seat. I mean, what was the point
of this? And somebody sent a

1368
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:17,250
note and saying this was a great
news. This is low budget

1369
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:21,990
filmmaking. He says it only cost
them one bullet, you know, and a

1370
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:25,560
day's pay for that a borrowed
jeep. I mean, it's just it was

1371
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,120
really kind of crummy.

1372
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:31,140
Adam Curry: I can hear keyboards
clicking don't send that email

1373
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:35,820
to us. We're just we're just
we're just looking at media and

1374
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:39,720
trying to understand what the
messaging is. Not we're not here

1375
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:43,170
to bring you the truth of what
actually happened. We don't have

1376
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:47,160
it. Nobody does. Exactly. That's
the point. But it's being

1377
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:50,730
presented as fact. We'll
continue with your clip here.

1378
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:53,190
Unknown: The only images we're
going to see for the next couple

1379
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:57,360
of weeks are dead Palestinians.
Earlier this year, a Gallup poll

1380
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,880
found that Democrats opinions on
Israel have changed

1381
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:03,930
significantly. 49% of Democrats
now say they sympathize more

1382
01:21:03,930 --> 01:21:07,590
with Palestine, while only 38%
say they sympathize more with

1383
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:10,590
Israel. That's the first time
more Democrats have said their

1384
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:13,200
sympathies are more with
Palestine than with Israel. In

1385
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,560
the 20 years the poll has been
conducted. Another Democratic

1386
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,560
lawmaker told Politico the key
is making sure that the

1387
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:23,220
sentiment doesn't grow and
metastasize. Meanwhile,

1388
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:26,010
Democratic Representative
Rashida to leave is still flying

1389
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:29,220
the Palestinian flag in front of
her office, Republican

1390
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:33,210
Congressman Max Miller commented
on that saying the Palestinian

1391
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:36,720
flag should not have a place
here. That's why I sponsored an

1392
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:40,470
appropriations amendment to end
this silliness under the

1393
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:43,980
amendment foreign flags couldn't
be displayed on Capitol Hill

1394
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:48,120
Adam Curry: no only pride flags,
no problem with it the

1395
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:50,970
John C Dvorak: same thing when I
heard that, but they you know,

1396
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:55,410
there's a little element here
that was kind of not noticed by

1397
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,440
anybody else, which is this this
idea that they've been pulling

1398
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:03,840
Democrats, and now the sympathy
for the Israelis is down to 39%

1399
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,860
and a sympathy for the
Palestinians up to 49% This is a

1400
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:13,560
switcheroo. And this may be part
of the of the reason to do we're

1401
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:17,520
going to bomb Iran. We got to do
it now. Because this is not

1402
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:23,700
going to go the it's not going
to reverse direction. Yes, it's

1403
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:24,810
clear trend.

1404
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:30,120
Adam Curry: Yeah. That's, that's
a good. You know, what also is

1405
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:34,170
interesting with all these
takedowns of misinformation. How

1406
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:37,260
is it that I'm sure you've seen
her? I didn't clip her. There's

1407
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:42,930
the Israeli blonde Israeli
woman, about 3540. Now must she

1408
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:48,510
must be over 40 Who says 25
years ago, she was you know, in

1409
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:52,140
service, she was specifically of
course, all young people go into

1410
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:55,920
service in Israel. Then she was
in the intelligence division.

1411
01:22:56,070 --> 01:23:00,810
And she's just she's she's doing
video after video. After a video

1412
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:04,440
about how this couldn't happen.
There's no way this was a setup.

1413
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:07,710
This could never happen when she
brought in the cat thing again.

1414
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:12,750
Like you can you can sense a
cat. You've got Brett Weinstein

1415
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:19,800
interviewing her but yet she's
allowed to continue explain

1416
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:24,510
that. If she knows this
information, why why is she

1417
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:25,770
still on the air?

1418
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:28,860
John C Dvorak: Just someone you
would take off just because

1419
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:35,100
Adam Curry: so yeah, and so that
she just continues so you cannot

1420
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:36,900
trust your social media.

1421
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:42,120
John C Dvorak: Now the media
social media. Tell it that all

1422
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:42,930
media Yeah,

1423
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,560
Adam Curry: but but people often
are still like, oh, I can still

1424
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,680
get all this on social media.
Look, I got the proof. Telegram.

1425
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:58,410
Wow, it's proof do you remember
Yanis Varoufakis Oh, yeah,

1426
01:23:58,410 --> 01:23:58,740
whatever

1427
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:02,130
John C Dvorak: happened to him?
Well, he has a really good to

1428
01:24:02,130 --> 01:24:05,160
tell you about bringing up an
old name yes. Yeah, it was one

1429
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:08,760
of the first guys who was pushed
to the curb kicked to the curb.

1430
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:09,300
So this is

1431
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:13,710
Adam Curry: when Greece was
taken down by the US banks was a

1432
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:17,160
Goldman and a couple others

1433
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:20,520
John C Dvorak: Yeah, they the
guy in the motorcycle Yes.

1434
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:24,480
Remember it's not to get it's
not the gay social media guy.

1435
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,590
Another guy disappeared.

1436
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:30,060
Unknown: You're thinking of the
case.

1437
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:34,440
John C Dvorak: Was that guy's
name? It wasn't conservative

1438
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:37,830
with the blonde Yeah, but social
media guy got kicked to the curb

1439
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:42,450
that guy No, this is he was
rough and tumble leather wearing

1440
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:45,120
bike riding American I think you

1441
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,330
Adam Curry: know history. He's
Greek mile. You're thinking of

1442
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:49,170
Yo yo,

1443
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:53,190
John C Dvorak: Milo now that did
this. This great guy ended up at

1444
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:56,610
the University of Texas I think
tape teaching economics, Disney

1445
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:59,280
Adam Curry: while he's an
economics. He's an economist

1446
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:04,980
economics. Feser and when Greek
Greece was being thrust into

1447
01:25:05,130 --> 01:25:08,280
austerity, and we covered all
this 2010, I want to say, so

1448
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:13,260
it's quite a while ago. And the
Greeks, they, what happened is,

1449
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:17,490
the bank said, Hey, we're
calling in our loan, how you can

1450
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:21,630
pay for it, austerity for you.
And all of the Northern Europe

1451
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:22,260
hated

1452
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:25,740
John C Dvorak: this. This was
right after the Greeks decided

1453
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:29,100
to join the Euros, which is
their biggest mistake.

1454
01:25:29,370 --> 01:25:33,270
Adam Curry: And people even go
into Greek restaurants in like

1455
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:36,510
Holland and say, I'm not paying,
because you screwed us. You

1456
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:40,050
stole our money. It was
horrible. So then this guy who

1457
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:43,680
and he's a, he's a Marxist, he
admits his I'm a socialist, I'm

1458
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,500
a Marxist. But he called he
says, in the traditional sense

1459
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,500
of the word, whatever that
means, whatever that means. And

1460
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:54,240
he became the minister of
finance for six months. And all

1461
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:57,630
he did is he just said, no, no
more loans. We're not taking any

1462
01:25:57,630 --> 01:26:01,680
more loans, which was probably a
good thing for Greece. And then

1463
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:04,440
his party got kicked out and he
got kicked out and get kicked

1464
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:08,370
out. And, and now, you know, all
the wealth is in the north in

1465
01:26:08,370 --> 01:26:11,250
the south of Greece. They're
driving around and Lamborghinis.

1466
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:15,720
And the rest of Greece is just
crap. What you get, that's how

1467
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:21,120
it works. They are the ugly
stepchild. So Yiannis resurfaces

1468
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:24,240
with a very interesting book
I've been reading called techno

1469
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:28,920
feudalism. And it kind of folds
into, you know, these platforms.

1470
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:36,270
And he says that capitalism is
in essence, over, because

1471
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:42,810
capitalism is now slave to cloud
capitalism. And that is all

1472
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:46,740
Silicon Valley based, that does
not exist anywhere else except

1473
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:51,180
China. China does have WeChat,
that is the big, the big

1474
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:55,290
competitor to the cloud
capitalists here in the US. And

1475
01:26:55,290 --> 01:26:59,160
he has a one minute. He's doing
interviews all over YouTube. And

1476
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:02,040
I've been fascinated by a lot of
what he's saying, I don't agree

1477
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:06,120
with all of it, of course. But
this idea, this concept was

1478
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:10,350
something I think we should, we
should think about as we see the

1479
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:14,340
world unfold, certainly with
secret meetings about AI and all

1480
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:14,820
that crap.

1481
01:27:15,150 --> 01:27:18,480
Unknown: But what does happen
is, if you're Jeff Bezos, if you

1482
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:23,070
are the owner of Google, of
Apple, of if you're Elon Musk,

1483
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:28,530
then you own this new form of
cloud capital, which allows you

1484
01:27:29,070 --> 01:27:34,200
to extract from the rest of
society from proletarians. But

1485
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:38,370
from everyone else, as well,
huge quantities of rents and

1486
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:43,230
surpluses in a manner that
reconsidered is a form of

1487
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:47,760
feudalism. The difference is
that instead of the original

1488
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:51,600
feudalism, which is a system
based on private ownership of

1489
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,530
land, which produces rent, now,
it's private ownership of the

1490
01:27:55,530 --> 01:27:58,200
clouds of cloud capital, because
the cloud is capital, right?

1491
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:01,140
It's not some clouds up in the
sky in the sky, which yields

1492
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:03,900
again, a form of rent every time
you buy something from

1493
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:09,000
amazon.com 40% of what you pay,
doesn't go to the capitalist, we

1494
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,970
selling you that stuff. It goes
to Jeff Bezos, that's a cloud

1495
01:28:11,970 --> 01:28:14,910
rent and he is a new form of
feudal lord.

1496
01:28:15,810 --> 01:28:18,090
I kind of agree with that. Yeah,

1497
01:28:18,150 --> 01:28:22,320
John C Dvorak: well, I sure
don't, you don't know. It all

1498
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,090
goes to Jeff Bezos off.

1499
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,400
Adam Curry: I mean, to me, of
course, is not the Bezos but he

1500
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:31,290
said it's a public company. But
But Amazon, you know that people

1501
01:28:31,290 --> 01:28:35,460
have a very hard time really
making profit on Amazon. The

1502
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:38,610
same thing for Apple, if you
want to sell an app 30% You want

1503
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:41,970
a subscription of something? 30%
This is why you can't buy a

1504
01:28:41,970 --> 01:28:46,860
Kindle through the app. on
Apple, they are charging rents

1505
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:49,320
for their platforms. It's true.

1506
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:52,350
John C Dvorak: It's not saying
that that's not true.

1507
01:28:52,350 --> 01:28:55,920
Adam Curry: Forget about the
beat down. That's just it's like

1508
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:59,130
John C Dvorak: minor. I mean,
it's like it's like one element

1509
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:02,880
of the DIS stamp. So this whole
idea of what does he call it

1510
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:07,920
kind of capitalism, techno
feudalism, techno feudalism that

1511
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:13,230
this harkens back to the book
called surveillance capitalism

1512
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:16,140
was different little different.
I don't think it's that much

1513
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:20,100
different. It was it's the same
kind of condemnation of tech,

1514
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:23,730
from a perspective of like,
well, these guys have made the

1515
01:29:23,730 --> 01:29:26,940
money that I didn't get to make.
It's just kind of a jealous

1516
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:30,120
mode. Dang, I'm not buying any
of it.

1517
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:34,140
Adam Curry: I think Spotify
tried to do this with

1518
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:35,040
podcasting.

1519
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:38,580
John C Dvorak: And that's where
they got so far they got, but

1520
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:39,270
that's because of

1521
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:43,860
Adam Curry: one special thing.
The ragtag band of developers at

1522
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:48,900
podcast index. We wanted their
plan single.

1523
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:52,230
John C Dvorak: How much effort
did it take to thwart their

1524
01:29:52,230 --> 01:29:53,670
plan? Not much.

1525
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:57,450
Adam Curry: Work. Google
inherited

1526
01:29:57,450 --> 01:29:59,970
John C Dvorak: the billions that
those guys dropped. Google was

1527
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,050
Not much. And

1528
01:30:01,050 --> 01:30:03,480
Adam Curry: that's only well,
because of RSS. Google is still

1529
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:06,900
trying. They're trying to try
and keep trying to talk

1530
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:08,700
everybody into into YouTube.

1531
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:11,970
John C Dvorak: This is another
anti capitalist screed

1532
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:15,720
definitely heard it before, from
a different angle.

1533
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:24,450
Adam Curry: Anyway, just one
quick. So my feeling in general

1534
01:30:24,450 --> 01:30:29,790
is that this is what somebody
wants to try and do with AI. And

1535
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:33,090
I've listened to the whole
interview with Sam Altman and

1536
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:40,800
Joe Rogan. Sam Altman is full of
crap. All he says is just AGI it

1537
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,100
will probably be about, you
know, three decades. Oh, okay.

1538
01:30:44,370 --> 01:30:47,670
Well, we're once Yeah, it's just
they'd be a 30 years we might

1539
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:52,680
have autonomous generative AI,
you know, we'll have

1540
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:55,830
John C Dvorak: getting closer to
the truth,

1541
01:30:55,860 --> 01:31:00,060
Adam Curry: but even then, I
mean, it's like, no, none of

1542
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:02,640
this is happening now. It's all
bull.

1543
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:05,670
John C Dvorak: Well, let me
bring us to real bullshit

1544
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:10,590
artists. Please. You have to go
into the last week's archives to

1545
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:11,670
get three clips.

1546
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:13,890
Adam Curry: Is it under
bullshit? No,

1547
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:17,430
John C Dvorak: this should be no
This is Maria. ReSSA

1548
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:22,110
Adam Curry: okay. Oh, yes. on
PBS. Oh, you got a three parter.

1549
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:22,860
I'm excited.

1550
01:31:24,690 --> 01:31:26,670
John C Dvorak: If you want to
hear somebody who doesn't know

1551
01:31:26,670 --> 01:31:28,230
what they're talking about,

1552
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:31,470
Adam Curry: this is PBS. This is
great. I love the going on with

1553
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:31,710
that

1554
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:34,620
John C Dvorak: black the new
black anchor that's there who's

1555
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:40,470
just seems like a dummy is this
seems I was gay or the guy.

1556
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:43,830
Yeah, that guy seems like a dumb
gay guy to me.

1557
01:31:43,919 --> 01:31:46,379
Adam Curry: And I couldn't be
there the worst John said.

1558
01:31:47,610 --> 01:31:51,960
John C Dvorak: They're the
worst. It's a smart gay guys. So

1559
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:57,450
this guy's lapping it up. And as
you can see it in his eyes. He's

1560
01:31:57,450 --> 01:32:00,060
got this look of Oh my God. Oh,
we're all gonna die.

1561
01:32:00,450 --> 01:32:04,200
Adam Curry: Oh, hold on. Let's
let's make sure we have America.

1562
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:08,250
This is NPR or PBS

1563
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:11,400
Unknown: veteran journalist and
past Nobel Peace Prize winner

1564
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:15,390
Maria ReSSA has a dire warning
about the defense of truth in

1565
01:32:15,390 --> 01:32:19,050
the digital age. She says we
risk losing the information war

1566
01:32:19,050 --> 01:32:22,050
to adversarial artificial
intelligence and to

1567
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:25,080
authoritarian governments who
can weaponize that technology.

1568
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:29,010
And she's experienced it
firsthand. In 2021, she won the

1569
01:32:29,010 --> 01:32:32,130
Nobel Prize for fighting to
protect freedom of expression in

1570
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:35,400
the Philippines under attack by
the regime of then President

1571
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,700
Rodrigo de terre Tae Jeff
Bennett spoke with rest of this

1572
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:41,910
week at the inaugural summit of
the newly launched Institute of

1573
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:44,520
global politics at Columbia
University.

1574
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:47,130
Reesa. Thank you so much for
speaking with us. I appreciate

1575
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:49,710
it. Thanks for having you have
said the world faces a tech

1576
01:32:49,710 --> 01:32:53,490
enabled Armageddon turbocharged
by generative artificial

1577
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:56,610
intelligence. Invoking
Armageddon sort of the final

1578
01:32:56,610 --> 01:32:59,880
battle between good and evil
might strike some people as a,

1579
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:03,840
as an overreach, it might strike
some people as being hyperbolic.

1580
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:06,990
But why in your view, is that an
accurate characterization?

1581
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:10,110
I've lived through this. You
know, I never thought I would

1582
01:33:10,110 --> 01:33:13,200
get 10 Arrest warrants in a
little over a year, right? I

1583
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:16,560
never thought I would have to go
to jail. I never thought that we

1584
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:21,030
would tear apart our shared
reality and doubt facts, and the

1585
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:26,130
lies could spread faster than
facts. MIT's 2018 Study shows

1586
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:30,150
lie spread six times faster. And
that has turned everything

1587
01:33:30,150 --> 01:33:33,510
upside down. Tech enabled
Armageddon, and Rappler the

1588
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:35,850
organization I read in the
Philippines we've been fighting

1589
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:38,190
for our survival since 2016.

1590
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:43,650
Adam Curry: Now Wayman, did she
get arrested by an AI that he

1591
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:45,630
John C Dvorak: liked that make
you believe that no, she got

1592
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:49,230
arrested because she was a
dissident in in the turkey under

1593
01:33:49,230 --> 01:33:51,570
the turret day when he was
running things and he was like,

1594
01:33:51,810 --> 01:33:54,570
putting everyone in jail and so
she got arrested and fought the

1595
01:33:54,570 --> 01:33:58,830
government or something and he
gets ended up here he's gone. So

1596
01:33:58,830 --> 01:34:02,820
she said okay, well Nobel Peace
Prize for being a do gooder. And

1597
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:06,990
now she's an expert on AI with
no tech background whatsoever.

1598
01:34:06,990 --> 01:34:07,320
So what

1599
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:10,620
Adam Curry: she's doing is she's
equating AI with a with a

1600
01:34:11,310 --> 01:34:16,110
dictator. Yeah, who makes
unintelligent decisions?

1601
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:17,760
John C Dvorak: I guess.

1602
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,190
Unknown: The fact that we were
still

1603
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:24,300
John C Dvorak: not you brought
that up. Why is she on this

1604
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:28,350
show? being interviewed by PBS
breathlessly that's what I'd

1605
01:34:28,350 --> 01:34:30,720
like to know. Oh, come on. An
expert.

1606
01:34:31,050 --> 01:34:34,080
Adam Curry: Doesn't matter. Who
isn't. Who is the expert on AI?

1607
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:40,470
Elon, well, she's not they can't
get Elon Musk. Sam Altman. He's

1608
01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:43,650
boring. He's boring. Well, this

1609
01:34:43,650 --> 01:34:44,550
John C Dvorak: girl is kind of
boring.

1610
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:46,500
Adam Curry: Oh, yeah. Yeah,
yeah, here we go.

1611
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:50,910
Unknown: The fact that we were
still here shows you that doing

1612
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:55,200
the right thing is the right
thing. But it's going to get

1613
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:58,020
worse. So the first time that
you had,

1614
01:34:58,470 --> 01:35:01,110
Adam Curry: I'm sorry, the
revenue ation of doing the right

1615
01:35:01,110 --> 01:35:03,750
thing is the right thing. It is
the right

1616
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:05,640
John C Dvorak: thing, and it's
gonna get worse. You bet

1617
01:35:05,670 --> 01:35:07,770
Unknown: it's going to get
worse. So the

1618
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:10,260
John C Dvorak: not You bet.

1619
01:35:10,559 --> 01:35:16,859
Adam Curry: Oh, I cannot believe
it. The jury will disregard my

1620
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:18,869
bet it's Yep. Yep, had

1621
01:35:18,870 --> 01:35:22,230
Unknown: humanity con. First
contact with AI is really

1622
01:35:22,230 --> 01:35:25,590
machine learning when everything
that you post on social media.

1623
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:28,140
So this is social media, right?
Everything you post is pulled

1624
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:31,380
together by machine learning.
And then that's used to build a

1625
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:33,930
model of you that knows you
better than you know yourself.

1626
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:38,760
Replace the word model with
clone. So we're cloned, then AI

1627
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:42,600
comes in and takes all of our
clones, puts it together in a

1628
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:45,990
mother lode database. That's
what's used to my does Oracle

1629
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:49,110
Adam Curry: make that the mother
lode database is that I think

1630
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:50,430
mother lode database

1631
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:52,320
John C Dvorak: is a great name
for a product.

1632
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:57,780
Adam Curry: You've heard of Ms.
SQL, this is the mother lode

1633
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:59,400
database, puts it together

1634
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:02,040
Unknown: in a mother lode
database, that's what's used to

1635
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:06,390
micro target. micro targeting is
not the same as media

1636
01:36:06,390 --> 01:36:07,110
advertising,

1637
01:36:07,230 --> 01:36:10,110
Adam Curry: that she's literally
describing data brokers, it

1638
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:12,720
already exists, lady, it's not
AI,

1639
01:36:12,870 --> 01:36:15,300
Unknown: media advertising, you
see the same things, right? But

1640
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:19,860
micro targeting sells your
weakest moment to a message to

1641
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:23,250
someone who will pay for it. And
that could be a company or that

1642
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:26,880
could be a government. Right?
Right? That right? Not just you.

1643
01:36:26,910 --> 01:36:31,470
And when it becomes relentless,
it becomes Information

1644
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:35,820
Operations. Those
vulnerabilities in the tech

1645
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:40,230
platforms have been exploited by
geopolitical power your America

1646
01:36:40,230 --> 01:36:46,410
in 20 1600 26 million Americans
were impacted were touch by

1647
01:36:46,410 --> 01:36:49,200
Russia, Russia and information
works.

1648
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:57,900
Adam Curry: Nice. Oh, my
goodness, this is all these

1649
01:36:57,900 --> 01:37:01,590
platforms are gonna suck.
Everything's gonna suck.

1650
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:03,360
mastered

1651
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:06,300
John C Dvorak: the idea of micro
targeting, which is you know,

1652
01:37:06,330 --> 01:37:12,600
targeted advertising. Hello, 98
Hello, right Hello 1970 For that

1653
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:13,740
matter way I first

1654
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,750
Adam Curry: I'm gonna get my
milk is going to be ordered the

1655
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:18,750
minutes out in my fridge, it's
going to be so smart the world

1656
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:20,670
would be groovy micro targeting.

1657
01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:27,090
John C Dvorak: So she's bringing
this back to the 2022 era. And

1658
01:37:27,210 --> 01:37:30,660
it's just unbelievable to me
that this is being played on.

1659
01:37:31,170 --> 01:37:35,610
PBS should be ashamed of itself.
For letting this woman ramble

1660
01:37:35,610 --> 01:37:38,160
like this. She's not saying
anything that means anything.

1661
01:37:38,190 --> 01:37:40,110
This is all bullshit.

1662
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:42,630
Unknown: You know, there are US
officials, there are tech

1663
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:46,230
leaders who have said that the
future of this country looks

1664
01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:50,760
fairly bleak if China finds a
way to develop AI technology

1665
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:54,780
faster than we do. So how do we
on the one hand, continue to

1666
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:59,400
innovate, but on the other hand,
implement solutions that don't

1667
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:02,340
strangle the innovation that
we're trying to unleash.

1668
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:07,350
Ironically, China, which is far
from Democratic, has put

1669
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:11,550
guardrails in place around that.
Yes. And they're large language

1670
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:14,370
models, right? Right. While
America says that

1671
01:38:14,370 --> 01:38:18,180
Adam Curry: just just to say, on
their large language models,

1672
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:22,980
right, it's like telling me, we
all agree, China has large

1673
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,720
language models, they put it

1674
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,970
John C Dvorak: down and they put
guard rails around it in the

1675
01:38:26,970 --> 01:38:30,990
mother lode. Now, a journalist
would be sitting there would

1676
01:38:31,110 --> 01:38:34,380
say, Well, what specifically are
those guardrails and how do they

1677
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:34,950
work?

1678
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,460
Adam Curry: What are you You
don't think that that's going to

1679
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,680
come out of PBS as a question to
you.

1680
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:45,990
John C Dvorak: I think at some
in some future world maybe

1681
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:49,110
Adam Curry: this we need to
write we asked world breed need

1682
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:53,100
a list of all these AI bullcrap
words that Sam Alban,

1683
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:56,370
guardrails, guardrails? Yeah,
like the guard rails guard

1684
01:38:56,370 --> 01:38:59,580
rails? Yeah, guard rails, they
really were. Yeah, that's a good

1685
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:01,530
point. What are the guard rails?

1686
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:04,560
John C Dvorak: Yeah, what are
they and how do they work?

1687
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,810
Because it doesn't make sense to
even say that.

1688
01:39:09,090 --> 01:39:12,240
Unknown: has put guard rails in
place around that, right? Yes,

1689
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:14,730
yeah. On their large language
models, right, right.

1690
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:19,470
Adam Curry: No, no, no evidence,
no stories on or anything about

1691
01:39:19,470 --> 01:39:22,560
this guardrails around their
large language models right in

1692
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:23,670
the mother lode database.

1693
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:27,540
Unknown: While America says that
remember, these companies are

1694
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:33,990
driven by profit, surveillance
capitalism. Large language

1695
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:38,790
models will have the ability to
mimic you, it mimics humanity.

1696
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:43,650
And when that happens, it also
doesn't tell you it lies. It

1697
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:48,780
looks for patterns. It doesn't
necessarily find meaning. That's

1698
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:52,200
what we've lost here. And if you
look at the two ways aI have

1699
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:57,360
touched us, the first time it
exploited our fear, anger and

1700
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:57,660
hate.

1701
01:39:59,070 --> 01:40:02,580
Adam Curry: I'm going to agree
It mimics humanity. It lies.

1702
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:06,270
Yeah, cuz we're all liars. Of
course. This is no this is not

1703
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:07,470
great, man.

1704
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:11,580
John C Dvorak: Okay did lie
without having AI. Yeah.

1705
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:18,240
Adam Curry: I was looking at
photos. Where's it here? I put

1706
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:18,690
it in the show

1707
01:40:18,690 --> 01:40:19,800
John C Dvorak: notes at the end
of that clip.

1708
01:40:20,009 --> 01:40:20,999
Adam Curry: Yeah, that was the
other clip.

1709
01:40:21,269 --> 01:40:24,089
John C Dvorak: Yeah it went on
there was there was telling

1710
01:40:24,089 --> 01:40:25,379
people you want to go look it up
here.

1711
01:40:25,409 --> 01:40:30,119
Adam Curry: Let me see there's
this Associated Press Photo. Man

1712
01:40:30,119 --> 01:40:38,189
it was of a black lives matter.
protest. And it's completely AI

1713
01:40:38,189 --> 01:40:41,819
there's people with six fingers.
There's there's a guy in the

1714
01:40:41,819 --> 01:40:45,329
background whose eyes like
bulging and all blurred into his

1715
01:40:45,329 --> 01:40:45,809
Hey,

1716
01:40:45,810 --> 01:40:47,340
John C Dvorak: love the bulging
eyes, it's

1717
01:40:47,370 --> 01:40:50,430
Adam Curry: been, it's the six
finger thing. It's just it's not

1718
01:40:50,430 --> 01:40:54,510
going away. AI is just not
great. Show me a picture with

1719
01:40:54,990 --> 01:40:57,360
well, it should be four fingers
on the thumb. But you know what

1720
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:04,680
I'm saying? It's not it's just
not great. It's people are

1721
01:41:05,250 --> 01:41:09,570
people fall for it. I'm telling
you that I am going to I'm going

1722
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:12,360
to save the world for 3% of the
people will be saved by our

1723
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:17,400
systems that we create with RSS.
Just 3% and everyone else is

1724
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:21,660
going to be a bloody good number
that's about and that's about

1725
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:24,630
what I think I can save. Is that
good enough for a Nobel Peace

1726
01:41:24,630 --> 01:41:25,080
Prize?

1727
01:41:27,090 --> 01:41:32,010
John C Dvorak: Well, we had to
exaggerate the lie. AI does have

1728
01:41:32,010 --> 01:41:35,670
to lie, to lie, but we can
manage it.

1729
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:38,550
Adam Curry: Here's an example of
a human being lying. This is a

1730
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:45,690
great example. This is again
Rear Admiral Kirby. And he is

1731
01:41:45,690 --> 01:41:50,010
asked a question about the
President's thinking. But he's

1732
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:52,920
very clear in his obvious lie.

1733
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:55,920
Unknown: I want to play this
soundbite for you that is just

1734
01:41:55,920 --> 01:42:00,300
last month and Vietnam and ask
you if this still holds for the

1735
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:04,710
President watch. The only
existential

1736
01:42:04,710 --> 01:42:11,010
threat humanity faces even more
frightening than nuclear war. is

1737
01:42:11,370 --> 01:42:16,410
global warming going above 1.5
degrees in the next 2010 years.

1738
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:20,190
Given all the nuclear players in
these two areas where we are now

1739
01:42:20,190 --> 01:42:22,680
engaged on does the President
stand by that comment?

1740
01:42:22,980 --> 01:42:25,740
Absolutely does climate change
is an existential threat, it

1741
01:42:26,970 --> 01:42:30,150
actually threatens and is
capable wiping out all human

1742
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:32,820
life on Earth. Time. I mean,
that's

1743
01:42:34,710 --> 01:42:37,410
Adam Curry: global warming
climate change is in competition

1744
01:42:37,410 --> 01:42:39,750
with AI who's going to kill us
faster

1745
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:42,900
Unknown: human life on earth
over time. I mean, that's I

1746
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:45,030
don't know how more existential,
you get to that. But that

1747
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:47,850
doesn't mean that we walk away
from our obligations, or our

1748
01:42:47,850 --> 01:42:50,460
national security interests in
very dangerous parts of the

1749
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:50,760
time.

1750
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:56,760
He said it was more frightening
than a nuclear war, is that it's

1751
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:59,820
more frightening than a nuclear
war in this moment.

1752
01:43:00,330 --> 01:43:03,270
The President believes
wholeheartedly that climate

1753
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:06,630
change is an existential threat
to the all human life on the

1754
01:43:06,630 --> 01:43:10,830
planet. That's just science.
That's a fact, Martha Beck on

1755
01:43:10,830 --> 01:43:13,890
the other challenges facing this
country and our allies and

1756
01:43:13,890 --> 01:43:14,880
partners around the world,

1757
01:43:14,910 --> 01:43:16,350
Adam Curry: that's just science
and focus,

1758
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,390
John C Dvorak: tip of the day
for that peace.

1759
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:22,290
Adam Curry: Just science, in
fact, Martha, that's all but it

1760
01:43:22,290 --> 01:43:26,040
is. I don't like that you
disparage my clip that way, but

1761
01:43:26,070 --> 01:43:31,770
I'll take the award. Thank you.
And the fact that her name is

1762
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:34,620
Martha makes it better. That's
just science. In fact, Martha

1763
01:43:35,970 --> 01:43:39,000
John C Dvorak: teaches science
in fact, wrong. It's just

1764
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,450
science, in fact that we're all
gonna die from global warming.

1765
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:45,930
Adam Curry: We're not because
we're going to save the world.

1766
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:48,870
No, we're gonna save the world
with carbon credits and right on

1767
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:51,780
cue as predicted on the wait,
wait,

1768
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:54,660
John C Dvorak: carbon credits,
does that change the mnemonic

1769
01:43:54,660 --> 01:43:56,340
carbon is released?

1770
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:59,550
Adam Curry: Why are you trying
to be difficult? Just sit back

1771
01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:04,200
and relax and take the
propaganda. Do you remember I

1772
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:08,370
had the clips from the big
climate change conference in in

1773
01:44:08,370 --> 01:44:14,910
Africa. And they were talking
about land being carbon sink. So

1774
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:19,320
you know, if you own a piece of
land in Africa, you can turn

1775
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:20,640
that into a carbon credit.

1776
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:22,110
John C Dvorak: Yum. Well, what
is

1777
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:27,450
Adam Curry: the United Arab
Emirates has inked a deal to buy

1778
01:44:27,450 --> 01:44:32,700
a fifth? That's 20% of
Zimbabwe's land, four carbon

1779
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:39,120
credits. This is great. 7.5
million hectares

1780
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:41,100
John C Dvorak: is one born every
minute.

1781
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:46,710
Adam Curry: What is 7.5 million
hectares is a hectare. It's

1782
01:44:46,710 --> 01:44:51,000
John C Dvorak: about 14 acres.
14 acres and LinkedIn I think is

1783
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,750
up to date tickets. It's like
for two acres proximately two a

1784
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:55,260
hectare.

1785
01:44:57,750 --> 01:45:01,350
Adam Curry: So there it is. I'll
look it up. The flurry so it's

1786
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:06,750
Oh, it's okay. The global $2
billion Voluntary Carbon Offset

1787
01:45:06,750 --> 01:45:11,850
market allows carbon emitters to
offset emissions by purchasing

1788
01:45:11,850 --> 01:45:15,600
credits from emission reducing
projects primarily in forest

1789
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,580
conservation. So

1790
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:21,390
John C Dvorak: I'm okay hectares
2.47 acres.

1791
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:24,150
Adam Curry: So if I have three
acres here could I turn that

1792
01:45:24,150 --> 01:45:29,370
into a carbon credit? Yeah, how
much? Not much but I could Chem

1793
01:45:29,370 --> 01:45:31,080
bucks it's like a Bitcoin

1794
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:34,020
John C Dvorak: I don't think
it's worth a Bitcoin No, but

1795
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:37,830
Adam Curry: it's like a Bitcoin
you just you just say well, I do

1796
01:45:37,830 --> 01:45:39,210
I got this I got this stuff. Oh,

1797
01:45:39,210 --> 01:45:42,270
John C Dvorak: yeah, you make it
Yeah. But everyone get for it.

1798
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:42,660
And if

1799
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:45,330
Adam Curry: I plant a tree,
another carbon credit and your

1800
01:45:45,330 --> 01:45:50,880
gold we should have been doing
this a long time ago. We really

1801
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:51,390
should have

1802
01:45:54,510 --> 01:45:56,010
John C Dvorak: the bank money in
the bank.

1803
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:59,520
Adam Curry: So very sad isn't we
should take a break but very sad

1804
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:06,510
for this next person. This
although, boy timing is

1805
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:14,460
everything. This this 911 10
times worse than 911, which is

1806
01:46:14,490 --> 01:46:17,670
almost as bad as January 6 could
not have come at a worst time

1807
01:46:17,670 --> 01:46:19,830
for this announcement, a new
curveball

1808
01:46:19,830 --> 01:46:23,310
Unknown: in the race for
president to declare myself an

1809
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:28,920
independent ganda. Robert F.
Kennedy Jr. Leaving the

1810
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:31,560
Democratic Party to run as an
independent

1811
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:32,760
Adam Curry: What are you
drinking?

1812
01:46:34,710 --> 01:46:37,740
John C Dvorak: It's the polar
just a plain polar seltzer get a

1813
01:46:37,740 --> 01:46:39,090
few more cans of this left

1814
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:41,550
Adam Curry: because I opened one
earlier you didn't you didn't

1815
01:46:42,030 --> 01:46:47,730
mention here it oh, I'm drinking
a source Perrier lime. From the

1816
01:46:47,730 --> 01:46:48,090
camp

1817
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:51,060
John C Dvorak: lime ladies and
gentlemen, very you know if

1818
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:56,430
anyone can find a blue bottles
of Perrier lightly carbonated

1819
01:46:56,460 --> 01:47:00,660
tastes just like low bad to wipe
my favorite sparkling beverage?

1820
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:00,810
Oh

1821
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:04,710
Adam Curry: no Budweiser like
boudoir. Like big bad dua. No,

1822
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:06,300
no be de Lobi day.

1823
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:08,880
John C Dvorak: I don't want to
drink low bid day.

1824
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:12,480
Adam Curry: The Democrats are
frightened that I'm gonna spoil

1825
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:15,780
the election for President Biden
and the Republicans are

1826
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:21,870
frightened that I'm gonna spoil
it for President Trump. The

1827
01:47:21,870 --> 01:47:23,910
truth is, they're both right.

1828
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:25,170
Unknown: Back in April, he

1829
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:28,680
launched a longshot bid for the
Democratic nomination. But his

1830
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:31,680
position on vaccines and
abortion were out of the party's

1831
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:35,130
mainstream his own siblings
denouncing his run as an

1832
01:47:35,130 --> 01:47:38,400
independent saying Bobby might
share the same name as our

1833
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:42,150
father but he does not share the
same values vision or judgment.

1834
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:45,030
We denounce his candidacy and
believe it to be perilous for

1835
01:47:45,030 --> 01:47:45,780
our country.

1836
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:47,430
denounce him.

1837
01:47:48,810 --> 01:47:51,240
John C Dvorak: denounce your own
you know, what are your own

1838
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:53,580
members of your own family? It's
disgusting

1839
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:57,090
Adam Curry: was pretty bad. But
this is not good for it. I mean,

1840
01:47:57,780 --> 01:48:00,690
John C Dvorak: the timing sodomy
is horrible, but this is also

1841
01:48:00,690 --> 01:48:04,050
done this like a week ago or
maybe a month from now? It

1842
01:48:04,050 --> 01:48:06,840
wouldn't it wouldn't have
mattered by the way. I was gonna

1843
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:10,980
say that report indicates that
he was thwarted. They did

1844
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:14,100
without going into any details.
There hasn't even doesn't been

1845
01:48:14,130 --> 01:48:17,400
the Democratic Convention yet.
There hasn't been any primaries.

1846
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:20,970
Adam Curry: Well, he he can't
get in. He can't he can't even

1847
01:48:20,970 --> 01:48:22,230
get in the primary lock

1848
01:48:22,230 --> 01:48:24,390
John C Dvorak: him out is what
she should what she should have

1849
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:25,620
said yes, I locked him

1850
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:30,450
Adam Curry: out. Eyes. I mean,
there's still a lot of time a

1851
01:48:30,450 --> 01:48:35,790
lot of things can happen. But I
see no reason why the military

1852
01:48:35,790 --> 01:48:39,690
industrial complex, the
financial, which is same as the

1853
01:48:39,690 --> 01:48:44,460
financial complex. Maybe this is
why Steve Steve Scalise Vegas

1854
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:46,830
possibly can become the new
Speaker of the House.

1855
01:48:47,370 --> 01:48:49,440
John C Dvorak: We that was my
assertion to him was your

1856
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,840
assertion. It was yours. But you
know, hey, you

1857
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,580
Adam Curry: know he's got
cancer. Wow, we can't have that

1858
01:48:53,580 --> 01:48:59,070
guy with cancer. Well get rid of
Raskin then to come on. This is

1859
01:48:59,070 --> 01:49:01,890
what kind of acts we kind of
that's that's probably the one

1860
01:49:01,890 --> 01:49:06,660
of the most demoralizing things
you can say. Hey, ma'am. I'm

1861
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:11,220
sorry. You can't run because you
got cancer. I mean, people

1862
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:17,970
survive. People live with him.
Just an Marjorie Taylor Greene.

1863
01:49:19,110 --> 01:49:21,660
Notice my voice going up when I
say your name, Marjorie Taylor.

1864
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:24,630
But you do that all the time
with Marjorie Taylor Greene why

1865
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:29,010
she do it up? Oh, no, no, no,
he's got cancer. Oh, no, we

1866
01:49:29,010 --> 01:49:32,310
can't have him do he might die
before he can sign more money

1867
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:33,690
for Ukraine and Israel?

1868
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:37,320
John C Dvorak: Well, they have
to put him in my thesis because

1869
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:40,620
he's all pro giving more money
to Ukraine. Yet while he was

1870
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:44,370
marginally, Marjorie, Democrats
should put him in. I mean, it

1871
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:48,510
just takes like 50 of them to
say yeah, and the whole thing

1872
01:49:48,510 --> 01:49:49,140
goes through

1873
01:49:49,170 --> 01:49:52,890
Adam Curry: how much do you
think? So I I think that 24

1874
01:49:52,890 --> 01:49:56,130
billion for Ukraine. I mean, the
public money, right? This is

1875
01:49:56,130 --> 01:49:59,190
just the stuff that they'll tell
us. I think that will now have

1876
01:49:59,190 --> 01:50:04,500
to move to 50 And I think
Israel, I think we go to 400

1877
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:06,450
billion, just for starters.

1878
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:09,720
John C Dvorak: Yeah, that's too
much. They don't need that much

1879
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:14,160
money down there for Iran. Well,
no, Ron's different. If that

1880
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:16,830
happens, then they have to start
putting money down there.

1881
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:20,010
Adam Curry: Yeah, that's what
it's for. That'd be great. And

1882
01:50:20,130 --> 01:50:22,800
who do we actually need to take
out? What do we need to do in

1883
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:23,580
Iran to

1884
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:28,230
John C Dvorak: Toy need to low
flying jets and Hello, flying

1885
01:50:28,230 --> 01:50:30,690
jets and bombs and there's a
neighborhood where all the

1886
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:34,170
mullahs live is known fact they
live in these mansions in some

1887
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:37,710
kind of walled garden
neighborhood. And you just go in

1888
01:50:37,710 --> 01:50:40,410
there and bomb all their houses
and then fly back and say, I

1889
01:50:40,410 --> 01:50:41,520
don't know what happened. You
just

1890
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:44,220
Adam Curry: hired you just got
us fired as the courier Devorah

1891
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:47,580
Consulting Group. This is not
the right answer. How do we get

1892
01:50:47,790 --> 01:50:49,620
real money out of it? Some real

1893
01:50:49,620 --> 01:50:51,240
John C Dvorak: Whoa, yeah,
there's not real money to do

1894
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:54,780
well. Yeah, good question. Good
point.

1895
01:50:56,130 --> 01:51:00,060
Adam Curry: It's not cheap to
send a aircraft carrier down

1896
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:00,420
there.

1897
01:51:01,110 --> 01:51:03,090
John C Dvorak: No, that's
expensive. It's very expensive,

1898
01:51:03,090 --> 01:51:05,970
and they're gonna send another
group. I don't have the clip.

1899
01:51:06,150 --> 01:51:11,130
But somebody else came on one of
the shows another action arm. Of

1900
01:51:11,130 --> 01:51:14,430
course, he says, yeah, and they
got to another group going in

1901
01:51:14,430 --> 01:51:18,420
and reported jumped on him and
go, what this is news jet. Tell

1902
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:21,870
me more. And they gave him no
bah bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.

1903
01:51:23,970 --> 01:51:26,010
That's good. That's good. It was
pretty funny.

1904
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:30,030
Adam Curry: So the other scandal
what was the other scandal wiped

1905
01:51:30,030 --> 01:51:33,540
from the front pages? So many
people benefit from this? Never

1906
01:51:33,540 --> 01:51:41,100
let a crisis go to waste.
Menendez. Menendez don't even

1907
01:51:41,130 --> 01:51:44,430
Don't talk about him anymore.
Bob Menendez and his corruption

1908
01:51:44,430 --> 01:51:45,060
scandal,

1909
01:51:45,270 --> 01:51:47,580
John C Dvorak: though he's a
total criminal.

1910
01:51:47,730 --> 01:51:50,190
Adam Curry: Well, do you
remember what I said?

1911
01:51:51,690 --> 01:51:52,560
John C Dvorak: No, I do not.

1912
01:51:52,589 --> 01:51:55,559
Adam Curry: I said his wife is
the problem. Yes, you

1913
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:56,790
John C Dvorak: did say that. I
remember that.

1914
01:51:57,059 --> 01:51:59,669
Unknown: This is the second time
he's been indicted in the last

1915
01:51:59,699 --> 01:52:03,179
eight years and report suggests
that Menendez his wife played a

1916
01:52:03,179 --> 01:52:09,959
major role in his murky deals.
Menendez med he's Armenian

1917
01:52:09,959 --> 01:52:12,629
American while studying
ARSLANIAN at a restaurant in

1918
01:52:12,629 --> 01:52:16,799
2018 and got married in 2020.
Prosecutors claim she played a

1919
01:52:16,799 --> 01:52:19,769
key role in collecting hundreds
of 1000s of dollars worth of

1920
01:52:19,769 --> 01:52:23,069
bribes from three New Jersey
businessmen seeking help from

1921
01:52:23,069 --> 01:52:26,819
the powerful lawmaker. Her role
was so vital that she was the

1922
01:52:26,819 --> 01:52:29,459
one who introduced Menendez to
parties connected to the

1923
01:52:29,459 --> 01:52:32,849
Egyptian government. According
to the indictment document. The

1924
01:52:32,849 --> 01:52:35,789
filing also states that Nadine
was unemployed before they met

1925
01:52:35,819 --> 01:52:38,609
but the following year, she
incorporated a new consulting

1926
01:52:38,609 --> 01:52:42,989
company strategic international
business consultants LLC. After

1927
01:52:42,989 --> 01:52:45,899
their marriage in 2020. She came
into possession of a large

1928
01:52:45,929 --> 01:52:48,959
amount of gold. She later sold
some of the bars for between

1929
01:52:48,959 --> 01:52:52,949
200,000 to $400,000, according
to the senators financial

1930
01:52:52,949 --> 01:52:59,849
disclosure reports. Now here's a
bit of context, Menendez was the

1931
01:52:59,849 --> 01:53:02,579
chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee until the

1932
01:53:02,579 --> 01:53:05,549
investigation became public.
That post gave him a lot of

1933
01:53:05,549 --> 01:53:09,359
influence in US foreign policy.
This is where wire Hannah comes

1934
01:53:09,359 --> 01:53:12,329
in. Nadine and Hannah were
friends for years before her

1935
01:53:12,329 --> 01:53:15,359
marriage to Menendez. According
to the indictment, Hannah helped

1936
01:53:15,389 --> 01:53:18,479
arrange meetings and dinners
between Menendez, Nadine and

1937
01:53:18,479 --> 01:53:21,509
Egyptian military and
intelligence officials. This was

1938
01:53:21,509 --> 01:53:24,599
part of a covert initiative
aimed at using the Senator's

1939
01:53:24,599 --> 01:53:28,379
influence to boost US aid to
Egypt. After one of these

1940
01:53:28,379 --> 01:53:32,069
meetings in 2018, Menendez
texted his wife telling her to

1941
01:53:32,069 --> 01:53:35,249
inform her that he would sign
off and a multimillion dollar

1942
01:53:35,249 --> 01:53:36,539
weapons sale to Egypt.

1943
01:53:37,290 --> 01:53:40,740
Adam Curry: Menendez should not
be impeached for corruption but

1944
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:44,880
for being an idiot this woman
snookered him in

1945
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:48,660
John C Dvorak: you know, I don't
know that this is really what

1946
01:53:48,690 --> 01:53:52,020
this sounds to me like you're
putting out a story that

1947
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:59,280
parallels the Biden story with
his son you it's his fault. And

1948
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:03,090
I think that's a judgment puts
in my mind I have a clip. New

1949
01:54:03,090 --> 01:54:04,380
bad stuff about Biden,

1950
01:54:05,250 --> 01:54:08,490
Adam Curry: Biden, hey, screw
the war in Israel. We've got the

1951
01:54:08,490 --> 01:54:10,920
Biden and Menendez stuff for you
right here.

1952
01:54:11,129 --> 01:54:14,039
Unknown: You record show that
President Biden was involved in

1953
01:54:14,039 --> 01:54:17,999
his son and brother's businesses
as vice president, America first

1954
01:54:17,999 --> 01:54:21,239
Lego published the records from
the National Archives following

1955
01:54:21,239 --> 01:54:25,199
a Freedom of Information Act
lawsuit. National Archives

1956
01:54:25,199 --> 01:54:28,229

4000 emails with Hunter Biden

1959
01:54:36,089 --> 01:54:40,559
himself over 1700 emails with
his brother James Biden, and

1960
01:54:40,559 --> 01:54:44,429
over 3700 emails was James
Biden's lie in whole group.

1961
01:54:44,699 --> 01:54:48,359
Biden has previously claimed he
was not involved in his son and

1962
01:54:48,359 --> 01:54:51,899
brothers business dealings.
America first legal said on X

1963

extensive commingling between

them. The House Oversight
Committee which has been

1965
01:54:57,629 --> 01:55:00,809
investigating the Biden's family
business dealings is also

1966
01:55:00,809 --> 01:55:04,259
commented saying Biden's
statement quote doesn't match

1967
01:55:04,259 --> 01:55:05,639
his track record

1968
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:15,390
Adam Curry: Oh, yes. You know, I
don't think anyone can say that

1969
01:55:15,390 --> 01:55:18,570
they don't feel much better
after just listening to this to

1970
01:55:18,570 --> 01:55:23,100
this hour and 50 minutes of the
no agenda show. I mean, you're

1974
01:55:31,230 --> 01:55:33,060
John C Dvorak: we're going to be

1975
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:35,430

1976
01:55:35,430 --> 01:55:36,510

1977
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:39,450
Adam Curry: Now they're coming
across the border. Coming right

1978
01:55:39,450 --> 01:55:39,720

1979
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:42,510

buddy wanted to send us some

1985
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:58,770
clips from somebody we won't
even mentioned his name. A guy

1986
01:55:58,770 --> 01:56:04,320
who is a well respected or not
well respected but a well

1987
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:10,200
followed. Guy as on the on the
YouTube and everyplace else and,

1988
01:56:10,650 --> 01:56:14,100
and I said that we don't play
this guy's clip. Charlie Kirk.

1989
01:56:14,610 --> 01:56:18,060
Oh, that's who it was Charlie
Kirk. And you said well, he just

1990
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:23,790

1992
01:56:26,070 --> 01:56:28,890
Adam Curry: We were supposed to
go. But I don't it's something

1993
01:56:29,130 --> 01:56:33,750
that somehow that didn't happen.
And it was a I think it was to

1994
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:40,050
raise money for the Tea Party,
which I guess still exist. And

1995
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:43,890
brother, so I don't know. And I
have nothing against Charlie

1996
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:45,180
Kirk. Personally, he's probably

1997
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:48,270
John C Dvorak: he's he's a very
easy, very sharp, very sharp

1998
01:56:48,270 --> 01:56:48,570
guy.

1999

2021
01:58:02,490 --> 01:58:04,230
Adam Curry: I mean, there's
nothing like John saying that he

2022
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:06,990
prefers the smart gay guys. I
mean, come on. That's common

2023

2035
01:58:52,410 --> 01:58:54,420
I'm not going to mention his

progressive nights sloughed and

not helpful. And then Oh, yeah.

2039

You

01:59:08,730 --> 01:59:09,390
constantly.

2042
01:59:09,870 --> 01:59:12,810
Adam Curry: And he's like, Well,
this is also the guy that claims

2043
01:59:12,810 --> 01:59:16,980
that we never talk about Julian
Assange and it's there's reasons

2044
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:20,550
I find it interesting. You don't
talk about Julian Assange. Mm

2045
01:59:20,550 --> 01:59:30,030
Hmm Hmm. Hmm. It's one of these
guys. Then he and I will not

2046
01:59:30,030 --> 01:59:33,390
stop posting until you
apologize. I don't know what the

2047
01:59:33,390 --> 01:59:38,370
heck he was talking about. And I
didn't realize that we were here

2048
01:59:38,370 --> 01:59:44,760
to work for you. Said the man
with a free account. We don't

2049
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:50,460
even run the thing. But you
know, it's like signaled noise

2050
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:53,730
people see this, you know, even
this even Macedon is bumming me

2051
01:59:53,730 --> 01:59:54,120
out.

2052
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:59,100
John C Dvorak: Really. bumming
you out. It's bumming me out. I

2053
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:02,400
haven't heard that term for
While mountains go wow. Oh, wow.

2054
02:00:02,910 --> 02:00:03,540
Yep, yep.

2055
02:00:06,810 --> 02:00:08,160
Adam Curry: And then it was like
he's a great

2056
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:12,120
John C Dvorak: guy. Oh, okay,
great guy this Assange

2057
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:13,770
Adam Curry: partisan night slot.

2058
02:00:14,730 --> 02:00:15,900
John C Dvorak: Who says he's a
great guy,

2059
02:00:15,930 --> 02:00:18,930
Adam Curry: everybody. Oh,
you're wrong. He's a great guy.

2060
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:21,780
I didn't say he wasn't a great
guy said he wasted my time with

2061
02:00:21,780 --> 02:00:22,650
a screenshot.

2062
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:24,630
John C Dvorak: How does anybody
know where there's a great guy

2063
02:00:24,630 --> 02:00:27,390
or not? Nobody be intermingled
because the thing because

2064
02:00:27,390 --> 02:00:30,390
Adam Curry: he's onboarded so
many people. He's a great guy.

2065
02:00:30,750 --> 02:00:32,790
John C Dvorak: He's
unbelievable. Okay, well,

2066
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,760
Adam Curry: I can't I can't how
I was going to bring my sister

2067
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:39,390
in. But I can't now because you
said something about me. So I

2068
02:00:39,390 --> 02:00:41,190
can't ever let her hear that
because you'd be so

2069
02:00:41,190 --> 02:00:43,440
disappointed. No agenda is no
good with you.

2070
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:47,700
John C Dvorak: On parents
getting kick him off, Master.

2071
02:00:47,730 --> 02:00:48,570
No,

2072
02:00:48,870 --> 02:00:54,210
Adam Curry: no, I'm kicking
myself off. It's annoying. I

2073
02:00:54,210 --> 02:00:56,100
just want to follow some blogs.

2074
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:59,580
John C Dvorak: Well, there's no
such thing anymore. Yes, there

2075
02:00:59,580 --> 02:00:59,940
is.

2076
02:01:00,180 --> 02:01:02,910
Adam Curry: Bringing it back
baby. books, movies,

2077
02:01:02,940 --> 02:01:07,350
documentaries. It's all going to
be RSS and I'm gonna I'm gonna

2078
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:11,550
the the army. The army will
create it. You watch. We start

2079
02:01:11,550 --> 02:01:14,820
with podcasts. No one has taken
down the podcast. No one has

2080
02:01:14,820 --> 02:01:17,790
taken on the podcast. They
tried. They couldn't they tried

2081
02:01:17,790 --> 02:01:18,750
to capture it. Couldn't

2082
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:23,400
John C Dvorak: you couldn't make
it Adams RSS. No. Yeah, you

2083
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:27,720
could be an arse okay.

2084
02:01:30,690 --> 02:01:32,970
Adam Curry: You can follow Adam
and origin the social.com I

2085
02:01:32,970 --> 02:01:35,550
won't post you follow Jhansi
Dvorak at norgine. The

2086
02:01:35,550 --> 02:01:38,610
social.com post something to him
and he'll say something grumpy

2087
02:01:38,610 --> 02:01:40,440
back. Everyone knows it.

2088
02:01:41,790 --> 02:01:43,980
Unknown: Everyone knows it.
We're no good. too rare.

2089
02:01:45,630 --> 02:01:48,630
Adam Curry: It's rare that you
say something grumpy? Yeah.

2090
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:54,840
Where's the evidence? And stuff
like that? All right, then

2091
02:01:54,870 --> 02:02:00,180
that's just the voice I hear my
head. Value for value is the

2092
02:02:00,180 --> 02:02:03,900
reason why you have not heard
any advertisements you've not

2093
02:02:03,900 --> 02:02:08,850
heard anything about gold or
gold? Buy gold buy gold. Yeah.

2094
02:02:08,940 --> 02:02:12,090
And this is the reason what's
happening now is the reason you

2095
02:02:12,090 --> 02:02:16,530
want to secure your future. You
want to buy some gold? I have

2096
02:02:16,530 --> 02:02:19,260
gold bars. John, have you bought
any gold recently? Did you get

2097
02:02:19,260 --> 02:02:19,380
in?

2098
02:02:20,940 --> 02:02:22,170
John C Dvorak: I buy a bar a
month.

2099
02:02:23,550 --> 02:02:27,960
Adam Curry: Bar a month. Wow.
What that DHL plug must be doing

2100
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:33,630
pretty well for you. Bar a
month. No, there's no no and no.

2101
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:36,630
The only advertisements are the
things that we as products we'd

2102
02:02:36,630 --> 02:02:39,420
like or if someone slipped
something in a donation. We're

2103
02:02:39,420 --> 02:02:42,600
fine with that one moment you
will Finchy your your company

2104
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:45,510
name I'm sure the door is being
burnt down with new clients

2105
02:02:45,510 --> 02:02:51,420
everywhere. Lena Lubetkin Yeah.
And so all we ask for is that

2106
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:55,650
you return some value time,
talent or treasure. It saves us

2107
02:02:55,680 --> 02:02:59,160
enormous resources. It really
makes no agenda show and you

2108
02:02:59,160 --> 02:03:03,330
know agenda nation what it is by
the work that everyone else does

2109
02:03:03,390 --> 02:03:06,600
for each other. Like the
meetups. Oh man, the new being

2110
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:11,640
at.io Sir sir de nonnamous. Is
he the upgrade is going to be

2111
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:15,900
phenomenal. I this being a.io.
Man, I can I just give you an

2112
02:03:15,900 --> 02:03:19,470
example of how cool since we're
in the donation segment. How

2113
02:03:19,470 --> 02:03:23,760
cool bing.io is okay, I want a
second. Yeah. So I was looking

2114
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:30,120
for something about a new story.
And this goes back to September

2115
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:37,200
14. So we're almost one month
ago. And it only took me I want

2116
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:41,790
to say 37 seconds to get exactly
what I wanted. And then and that

2117
02:03:41,790 --> 02:03:44,820
includes the editing of the harp
at the beginning of the listen

2118
02:03:44,820 --> 02:03:49,530
to this report from the show
1597 boots on the ground report

2119
02:03:49,530 --> 02:03:52,980
that is troubling from
Massachusetts. In the morning

2120
02:03:52,980 --> 02:03:56,490
boys quick update from the
horrible state of tax that UCITS

2121
02:03:56,640 --> 02:04:00,240
My cousin is set to get married
over Columbus Day weekend. The

2122
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:03,270
groom's family is from out of
town and they rented two floors

2123
02:04:03,270 --> 02:04:05,910
of a hotel so they could all be
together for the weekend.

2124
02:04:06,150 --> 02:04:11,700
Governor Healy just seized the
hotel to house migrants so they

2125
02:04:11,700 --> 02:04:14,370
have lost their reservations.
There's nowhere else to say on

2126
02:04:14,370 --> 02:04:17,370
top of it. All the hotels that
are housing migrants are having

2127
02:04:17,370 --> 02:04:23,700
fires, assaults, etc. It's a
nightmare. So that is one month

2128
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:27,960
ago. One month ago on your no
agenda show and what pops up

2129
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:28,350
today.

2130
02:04:28,379 --> 02:04:32,189
Unknown: Early this year Travel
Agent Mark man's back booked 400

2131
02:04:32,189 --> 02:04:36,119
rooms for clients to stay near
Foxborough for the big Army Navy

2132
02:04:36,119 --> 02:04:39,749
game. Most of his clients are
veterans and plan to stay in

2133
02:04:39,749 --> 02:04:43,889
hotels like Comfort Inn and Best
Western only recently being told

2134
02:04:43,949 --> 02:04:47,639
up to 70 of those rooms were
canceled to make room for

2135
02:04:47,639 --> 02:04:50,819
migrants now staying there was a
done deal. I mean, they'd

2136
02:04:50,819 --> 02:04:52,709
already started taking in
migrants.

2137
02:04:52,740 --> 02:04:55,830
I was very concerned and
troubled to hear that any

2138
02:04:55,830 --> 02:04:58,170
veteran may have had their rooms
canceled.

2139
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:01,200
Go to Bora Healy has directed
her Secretary of Veterans

2140
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:04,920
Affairs to help those veterans
but for many the damage is

2141
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:05,700
already done

2142
02:05:05,730 --> 02:05:09,540
as I understand it, those were
decisions made by area hotels.

2143
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:13,080
Oh yeah, so management confirms
they are providing shelter and

2144
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:17,490
support to refugees, saying we
consider it a privilege to offer

2145
02:05:17,490 --> 02:05:21,240
a safe haven to those who have
been forced to flee their homes

2146
02:05:21,300 --> 02:05:23,190
due to challenging
circumstances.

2147
02:05:23,220 --> 02:05:25,830
Adam Curry: We know that's code
for man the government gave us a

2148
02:05:25,830 --> 02:05:27,060
lot more money than those two

2149
02:05:27,870 --> 02:05:29,460
John C Dvorak: new vets are
gonna give us for these

2150
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:30,180
veterans. That's

2151
02:05:30,180 --> 02:05:33,240
Adam Curry: no good. We don't
care about them. twice as

2152
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:36,810
John C Dvorak: much money from
my for housing and migrant we

2153
02:05:36,810 --> 02:05:39,030
get straight from the government
checks cash and the

2154
02:05:39,030 --> 02:05:42,720
Adam Curry: governor's like, oh,
no, what I can't believe that.

2155
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:46,290
That's crazy. I had no idea this
was happening. So that's what

2156
02:05:46,290 --> 02:05:48,930
being a doctor that's just one
of the many beautiful things

2157
02:05:48,930 --> 02:05:52,920
that we receive as gifts and
value from our producers all

2158
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:56,550
around the world all around no
agenda nation. We also have

2159
02:05:56,550 --> 02:06:00,120
artists and the artists ever
since we started ragging on

2160
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:03,810
their AI have been doing a lot
better. The artwork for episode

2161
02:06:03,810 --> 02:06:08,640
1597 Was I mean, we had some
choices to make. But this was so

2162
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:12,420
perfect because it was the
Fibonacci episode than our last

2163
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:15,570
probably the last one. Well,
considering it'll be another

2164
02:06:15,570 --> 02:06:18,930
1000 episodes before we get to
one. Yeah, I think I think

2165
02:06:20,220 --> 02:06:21,720
John C Dvorak: we're gonna do
2500 And

2166
02:06:23,250 --> 02:06:26,610
Adam Curry: fo Diddley, also
known as Sir Schouwburg did a

2167
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:30,150
just a wonderful piece of
Fibonacci art with no agenda on

2168
02:06:30,150 --> 02:06:33,510
top of it. If you haven't seen
it, then that mean, you missed

2169
02:06:33,510 --> 02:06:35,670
out? Because man, this is good.

2170
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:40,410
John C Dvorak: Yes, it was. It
was. It wasn't we looked and

2171
02:06:40,410 --> 02:06:44,880
looked and looked. And I mean,
we both kind of liked the war

2172
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:49,170
calendar. We liked it a lot. by
Sir shooting. Yeah, it's

2173
02:06:49,170 --> 02:06:50,010
dynamite.

2174
02:06:50,130 --> 02:06:52,980
Adam Curry: We figured we could
use it any time because

2175
02:06:53,670 --> 02:06:56,340
John C Dvorak: we never do that.
By the way. We always talk a big

2176
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:57,030
game about it.

2177
02:06:57,060 --> 02:07:00,480
Adam Curry: I use it for the for
the bad signal today. Oh, good.

2178
02:07:00,510 --> 02:07:00,810
Yeah.

2179
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:03,960
John C Dvorak: Well, well, then.
That's something Yeah. We talk a

2180
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:08,040
big game about that. I also
liked comic strip, strip

2181
02:07:08,070 --> 02:07:13,560
bloggers Air Force, the
parachute. It was la I

2182
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:17,070
obviously. But the no agenda
thing. We looked and looked at

2183
02:07:17,070 --> 02:07:20,970
it. And it's just like it was it
just a good looking piece.

2184
02:07:21,030 --> 02:07:24,750
Adam Curry: It actually probably
wasn't a Fibonacci, golden ratio

2185
02:07:24,750 --> 02:07:27,480
because of the square size of
the of the art.

2186
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:31,290
Unknown: So it felt it felt a
little off. I don't know.

2187
02:07:31,290 --> 02:07:33,870
John C Dvorak: I think it looks
pretty legit to me. But whatever

2188
02:07:33,870 --> 02:07:38,310
the case, it was dynamite. And
it just worked out. Yeah. As a

2189
02:07:38,310 --> 02:07:41,310
pretty piece. And then it's a
little different. It was great.

2190
02:07:42,120 --> 02:07:42,510
So

2191
02:07:43,890 --> 02:07:44,910
Adam Curry: what else did we

2192
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:49,620
John C Dvorak: look at? There
wasn't really much. I mean,

2193
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:52,050
there's a lot of stuff that
could be used

2194
02:07:52,080 --> 02:07:54,750
Adam Curry: Biden kicking the
dog, but the Biden wasn't good.

2195
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:55,290
Yeah, we

2196
02:07:55,290 --> 02:07:57,000
John C Dvorak: didn't talk
enough about Biden kicking the

2197
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,170
dog anyway.

2198
02:07:58,590 --> 02:08:01,560
Adam Curry: Now. What else was
there?

2199
02:08:01,860 --> 02:08:04,590

2201
02:08:11,730 --> 02:08:15,150
hindsight, I think that lather
rinse repeat by the spook was

2202
02:08:15,180 --> 02:08:23,100
kind of nice. to two different
versions. But still, it just

2203
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:24,210

John C Dvorak: Yeah, you get
that a lot with somebody who's

ideas in their head and they do

02:18:06,210 --> 02:18:09,360

through to the 50s won't take
very long and then Bruce

2365
02:18:22,379 --> 02:18:24,359
John C Dvorak: Schwalm starts us
off from Harrisburg,

2366
02:18:24,359 --> 02:18:30,899
Pennsylvania. $133. And it says
David poeple poeple and

2367
02:18:30,899 --> 02:18:36,509
curiously, Australia 12863. And
this is a switcheroo for his

2368
02:18:36,509 --> 02:18:39,809
lovely wife Liz's birthday. It
needs a de douching

2369
02:18:41,790 --> 02:18:43,620
Unknown: you've been de deuced

2370
02:18:45,750 --> 02:18:47,820
John C Dvorak: Yeah, Australians
can get a biscuit for their

2371
02:18:47,820 --> 02:18:49,230
birthday if you can hit that
button.

2372
02:18:51,150 --> 02:18:55,050
Adam Curry: Sorry. I should that
shouldn't be a button. Hold on.

2373
02:18:55,590 --> 02:18:56,280
You asked for it.

2374
02:18:56,309 --> 02:18:59,189
John C Dvorak: They always give
me a biscuit on my birthday God

2375
02:18:59,729 --> 02:19:03,599
and His Pull, pull. Pull pull is
how you pronounce it. I speak of

2376
02:19:03,599 --> 02:19:07,079
the devil. There's Dana Brunetti
from Golden cloud ranch in

2377
02:19:07,289 --> 02:19:11,669
California. That's his ranch. I
will read some of this because

2378
02:19:11,669 --> 02:19:16,409
of the nature of possibly
getting a big part. Monday is a

2379
02:19:16,409 --> 02:19:20,279
Stella's 11th birthday. She's on
the list. The only show episode

2380
02:19:20,279 --> 02:19:22,979
she ever wants to hear while I'm
driving her to school is the

2381
02:19:22,979 --> 02:19:26,609
episode last year where she got
a birthday shout out. Yeah,

2382
02:19:26,699 --> 02:19:29,519
mentioned her every show and I
can listen with her in the car.

2383
02:19:30,419 --> 02:19:34,139
Also, there's a good Fibonacci
reference in my movie 21 about

2384
02:19:34,139 --> 02:19:39,329
the MIT car card counters. He
comes in with a with a 112 30

fives like I discerned two
things from this to 112 a Senate

2386
02:19:42,899 --> 02:19:45,989
becoming an executive producer.
He comes in with just a low

2387
02:19:45,989 --> 02:19:49,199
level. He's running out of
money. He's and he's talks about

2388
02:19:49,199 --> 02:19:52,529
one of his old movies. He's
going back into the business of

2389
02:19:52,529 --> 02:19:53,939
being a producer.

2390
02:19:53,970 --> 02:19:57,630

2392
02:20:04,440 --> 02:20:07,320

Okay,

2551
02:30:58,619 --> 02:31:05,729
Adam Curry: I'm back. I'm back.
I have two to two ISOs to I

2552
02:31:05,729 --> 02:31:08,279
think one of them's the winner.
Do you want to do yours first?

2553
02:31:08,279 --> 02:31:09,299
Are you always how you

2554
02:31:09,420 --> 02:31:10,620
John C Dvorak: did mine first
lesson?

2555
02:31:10,949 --> 02:31:15,179
Adam Curry: You love it? You're
wanted for Christmas? That's one

2556
02:31:16,349 --> 02:31:18,899
second I got a boost this next
one this is the winner Houma

2557
02:31:19,019 --> 02:31:21,809
This is the winner. Me just
looks at the volume sometimes

2558
02:31:21,809 --> 02:31:24,419
these aren't good. Okay, here we
go. This is the winner there is

2559
02:31:24,419 --> 02:31:28,949
just not enough of Taylor Swift
Come on. Come on. That's the

2560
02:31:28,949 --> 02:31:29,669
winner right there.

2561
02:31:29,700 --> 02:31:32,370
John C Dvorak: I like it. I like
it. I may have beat her when it

2562
02:31:32,370 --> 02:31:36,180
means now I have a couple here
that I thought I could fit that

2563
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:40,170
I only I actually have one and
that one the other ones I have

2564
02:31:40,200 --> 02:31:43,710
are just an example of using the
Adobe thing and having it come

2565
02:31:43,710 --> 02:31:50,010
out cleaner but using but
changing some word now listen to

2566
02:31:50,010 --> 02:31:55,080
I get to I so big win and then I
so big win fix the play. I saw

2567
02:31:55,080 --> 02:31:57,660
big win and this is the clip I
wanted to fix.

2568
02:31:57,870 --> 02:32:01,650
Unknown: So a big way. Okay, so
a

2569
02:32:01,650 --> 02:32:06,480
John C Dvorak: big win. Yeah. So
a big win. big wig almost it was

2570
02:32:06,480 --> 02:32:09,990
so nice. But that's the problem
I have Adobe couldn't understand

2571
02:32:09,990 --> 02:32:12,390
it either. But he's but it was
big win.

2572
02:32:12,420 --> 02:32:17,070
Adam Curry: Okay, so here's the
Adobe product. Fixed Here we go.

2573
02:32:17,340 --> 02:32:20,280
Unknown: So I may weigh between

2574
02:32:21,210 --> 02:32:25,500
John C Dvorak: the big one a big
win big wing, the big wing

2575
02:32:26,340 --> 02:32:31,770
thanks to Adobe change when to
Wing Wing for nothing that's AI

2576
02:32:31,770 --> 02:32:37,440
for you. So now let's go to my
other one which is fact check

2577
02:32:37,440 --> 02:32:38,070
true

2578
02:32:38,130 --> 02:32:39,390
Unknown: fact check true

2579
02:32:41,940 --> 02:32:46,170
Adam Curry: na na na na nah,
this beats it. I mean, this is

2580
02:32:46,170 --> 02:32:49,920
just not enough of Taylor Swift
Come on. That's just that's the

2581
02:32:49,950 --> 02:32:50,670
that wins.

2582
02:32:53,010 --> 02:32:55,080
John C Dvorak: So I did a little
digging in this Taylor Swift

2583
02:32:55,080 --> 02:32:55,590
story.

2584
02:32:57,570 --> 02:32:58,530
Adam Curry: Why?

2585
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:02,430
John C Dvorak: Because I'm
because this seems to me to be a

2586
02:33:02,430 --> 02:33:06,990
play by one public relations
firm to get NFL as one of their

2587
02:33:06,990 --> 02:33:09,150
clients because they have a
bunch of players and Taylor

2588
02:33:09,150 --> 02:33:13,320
Swift for some unknown reason is
probably write this up in the

2589
02:33:13,320 --> 02:33:18,480
newsletter. She is managed
publicity wise by us sports

2590
02:33:18,480 --> 02:33:24,150
management company that manages
athletes. Yeah. And she's there

2591
02:33:24,180 --> 02:33:27,180
among the athletes and this
makes nothing but sense that

2592
02:33:27,180 --> 02:33:30,540
they set her up with his a phony
boyfriend story, which is

2593
02:33:30,540 --> 02:33:33,780
Hollywood does all the time, of
course, but let's do it for the

2594
02:33:33,780 --> 02:33:36,570
NFL and get the numbers up. She
didn't show up in the last game.

2595
02:33:36,570 --> 02:33:40,080
We will never hear from her
again in the football era. And

2596
02:33:40,080 --> 02:33:44,100
she never was boyfriend
girlfriend bowl crap. But people

2597
02:33:44,100 --> 02:33:45,090
lapped it up.

2598
02:33:46,380 --> 02:33:48,450
Adam Curry: Do you have a clip
to go along with this or?

2599
02:33:49,019 --> 02:33:50,819
John C Dvorak: No, I use his
brother because you brought that

2600
02:33:50,819 --> 02:33:52,319
clip and I had to say something,

2601
02:33:52,349 --> 02:33:53,939
Adam Curry: just all your
assertions.

2602
02:33:55,440 --> 02:33:59,850
John C Dvorak: Alright, so I got
some I have some offbeat clips.

2603
02:34:00,269 --> 02:34:02,369
Adam Curry: Before we do
offbeat. Let's end with that. So

2604
02:34:02,369 --> 02:34:03,689
I can just depress everybody.
Well,

2605
02:34:03,690 --> 02:34:05,190
John C Dvorak: they're not
offbeat in that way. They're

2606
02:34:05,190 --> 02:34:09,510
their news clips that include
this one, which is Holland

2607
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:12,210
climate change. Oh, here we go.

2608
02:34:12,270 --> 02:34:14,490
Unknown: And the Netherlands.
climate activists are

2609
02:34:14,490 --> 02:34:18,210
celebrating after lawmakers
Tuesday approved a motion

2610
02:34:18,210 --> 02:34:21,810
requiring the Dutch cabinet to
come up with a plan to phase out

2611
02:34:21,810 --> 02:34:25,800
fossil fuel subsidies. This
comes after a sustained campaign

2612
02:34:25,800 --> 02:34:28,980
by activists including a nearly
month long blockade of a major

2613
02:34:28,980 --> 02:34:33,240
highway this Lucas phenotypes of
extinction rebellion

2614
02:34:33,270 --> 02:34:34,230
Netherlands,

2615
02:34:34,410 --> 02:34:38,100
after a month long of daily
protests and more than 9000

2616
02:34:38,100 --> 02:34:41,910
arrests. The Dutch parliament
asked the Cabinet to come up

2617
02:34:41,910 --> 02:34:45,990
with scenarios for phase out of
fossil fuel subsidies during

2618
02:34:45,990 --> 02:34:49,830
this campaign we achieved
transformation I think of Dutch

2619
02:34:49,830 --> 02:34:54,150
society, with three quarters of
the people now wanting a phase

2620
02:34:54,150 --> 02:34:58,140
out of fossil fuel subsidies.
And even a third of the people

2621
02:34:58,140 --> 02:35:02,010
want immediate stuff out All
fossil fuel subsidies that is

2622
02:35:02,010 --> 02:35:07,080
the extinction rebellion demand.
So a big way. Yes.

2623
02:35:07,230 --> 02:35:10,050
Adam Curry: Let me tell you this
is some bull crap from the from

2624
02:35:10,050 --> 02:35:13,890
this ditch guy and I tell you
why. Okay, you ready for this?

2625
02:35:14,460 --> 02:35:19,320
This cabinet this cabinet fell a
while ago, so they cannot make

2626
02:35:19,320 --> 02:35:22,950
any laws or anything Intel
there's a new cabinet after

2627
02:35:22,950 --> 02:35:27,990
elections in November. So he is
full of vasavi coward. We call

2628
02:35:27,990 --> 02:35:29,730
it cow crap in Holland.

2629
02:35:31,380 --> 02:35:33,900
John C Dvorak: Well, the other
thing about that clip is that

2630
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:39,210
they want to end fossil fuel
subsidies. What what is that?

2631
02:35:40,140 --> 02:35:42,360
It's not about ending fossil
fuel.

2632
02:35:42,420 --> 02:35:44,940
Adam Curry: It doesn't matter.
We got those idiots off of the

2633
02:35:44,940 --> 02:35:48,690
aid valve. It was annoying. We
couldn't shoot them with water

2634
02:35:48,690 --> 02:35:52,200
cannons because they were crying
all the time about it. So we

2635
02:35:52,200 --> 02:35:57,870
just say okay, you get something
from us go value children's cast

2636
02:35:57,870 --> 02:36:00,390
was actually pretty good. I
think I think I nailed that guy.

2637
02:36:00,630 --> 02:36:03,480
John C Dvorak: Nailed it. You
nailed it. You nailed it. You

2638
02:36:03,480 --> 02:36:06,450
will get nasty notes from some
of your Dutch. Oh,

2639
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:09,390
Adam Curry: no, they agree. They
think they think it's all

2640
02:36:09,390 --> 02:36:14,100
annoying. Let's do something
depressing for a moment. And

2641
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:18,000
then we'll do something funny.
You recall the well, actually,

2642
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:24,660
you had the clips of the DNA
gene jock from the South

2643
02:36:24,660 --> 02:36:32,040
Carolina. What was it it was a
special hearing about COVID

2644
02:36:32,070 --> 02:36:35,190
About the vaccines about DNA
being in the

2645
02:36:35,610 --> 02:36:39,900
John C Dvorak: DNA being in the
vaccines and going into your

2646
02:36:39,900 --> 02:36:45,480
system as you know, recombinant
and putting it into your your

2647
02:36:46,350 --> 02:36:47,520
genetic material?

2648
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:49,920
Adam Curry: Yes, none of this
seems to be doing very well for

2649
02:36:49,920 --> 02:36:54,840
a lot of people. And this same
ad hoc committee on the health.

2650
02:36:55,500 --> 02:36:56,160
Department of

2651
02:36:56,160 --> 02:36:59,460
John C Dvorak: Health seems to
be making a lot of people sick.

2652
02:36:59,850 --> 02:37:02,850
Adam Curry: Well, here is Dr.
Karen DeVore. She's a

2653
02:37:02,850 --> 02:37:06,600
dermatologist. Nice lady. two
parter.

2654
02:37:06,750 --> 02:37:09,330
Unknown: In the last two and a
half years since a vaccine has

2655
02:37:09,330 --> 02:37:12,840
been widely promoted. And many
patients have taken it out of

2656
02:37:12,840 --> 02:37:18,840
fear and isolation. The patients
who took the vaccine still get

2657
02:37:18,840 --> 02:37:23,970
COVID. And now I see patients
and I could not believe the

2658
02:37:23,970 --> 02:37:26,910
attorney whose spokesman said he
had heard the same thing because

2659
02:37:26,910 --> 02:37:30,030
in 30 years of practicing
dermatology, I've never heard

2660
02:37:30,030 --> 02:37:34,170
people describe their symptoms
this way. I am itching from my

2661
02:37:34,170 --> 02:37:41,580
bones out. I am on fire from the
inside. I see the most unusual

2662
02:37:41,580 --> 02:37:45,240
rashes and they don't respond
well to treatment. And they last

2663
02:37:45,240 --> 02:37:49,560
for months or years. I see
previously well controlled

2664
02:37:49,740 --> 02:37:54,300
autoimmune diseases like
psoriasis and eczema and lupus

2665
02:37:54,390 --> 02:37:59,850
now totally out of control. I
see your see aggressive, severe

2666
02:37:59,850 --> 02:38:03,690
shingles, it is more painful, it
is lasting longer. And this is

2667
02:38:03,690 --> 02:38:08,850
even in those who've had the
shingles vaccine. I see rapidly

2668
02:38:08,850 --> 02:38:12,150
growing skin cancers, including
basal cells that are just

2669
02:38:12,180 --> 02:38:15,540
supposed to be traditionally
very slow growing. I see

2670
02:38:15,540 --> 02:38:18,090
squamous cells, cutaneous
squamous cells that are

2671
02:38:18,090 --> 02:38:22,170
metastasizing much more often
than they ever did before. And

2672
02:38:22,170 --> 02:38:26,700
melanomas have become so unusual
and much harder to diagnose.

2673
02:38:26,940 --> 02:38:30,240
They are much more advanced at
presentation, and I have to

2674
02:38:30,240 --> 02:38:34,770
biopsy more and more things. And
it's all in vaccinated patients.

2675
02:38:35,280 --> 02:38:38,730
Adam Curry: So that's her
professional in her profession

2676
02:38:38,730 --> 02:38:41,940
in her field in the medical
profession. And he or she's

2677
02:38:41,940 --> 02:38:44,580
talking about just some other
ancillary things she has

2678
02:38:44,580 --> 02:38:45,090
noticed.

2679
02:38:45,150 --> 02:38:48,360
Unknown: And then beyond my
field, patients that I have seen

2680
02:38:48,390 --> 02:38:52,440
regularly for six to 12 months,
every six to 12 months for 30

2681
02:38:52,440 --> 02:38:55,320
years. They're aging more
rapidly. They've got unhealthy

2682
02:38:55,320 --> 02:38:58,050
weight loss, they keep their
balances bad, they're falling,

2683
02:38:58,050 --> 02:39:00,900
they're black and blue. They
can't get on an exam table. And

2684
02:39:00,900 --> 02:39:04,020
you see their medical updates as
they were in and they've had

2685
02:39:04,020 --> 02:39:07,170
atrial fibrillation, pacemakers,
heart attack strokes, blood

2686
02:39:07,170 --> 02:39:11,700
clots, pulmonary embolism,
Parkinsonism, ALS, tremors,

2687
02:39:11,910 --> 02:39:15,450
nerve policies, miscarriages,
infertility, did I mention

2688
02:39:15,450 --> 02:39:19,080
aggressive new ones that
cancers, recurrent stage four

2689
02:39:19,080 --> 02:39:23,580
cancers after 20 years of
remission? I know for people in

2690
02:39:24,330 --> 02:39:27,720
one small zip code in
Spartanburg that have rare

2691
02:39:27,720 --> 02:39:32,130
leukemias, three or four of them
are dead now, in over 30 years

2692
02:39:32,130 --> 02:39:34,770
of medical practice. I've
probably only known one or two

2693
02:39:34,770 --> 02:39:38,010
people who had Lou Gehrig's, or
ALS disease, and they were

2694
02:39:38,040 --> 02:39:41,760
distant and not really you know,
third or fourth contacts I now

2695
02:39:41,760 --> 02:39:44,910
know three people in my
immediate range of contact

2696
02:39:45,930 --> 02:39:47,190
Adam Curry: you know what's to
blame

2697
02:39:50,580 --> 02:39:56,580
John C Dvorak: Putin okay with
that, you're right. That was a

2698
02:39:56,580 --> 02:39:57,540
depressing clip. But

2699
02:39:57,540 --> 02:39:59,550
Adam Curry: now Now I'm going to
take you out of it. I'm taking

2700
02:39:59,550 --> 02:39:59,670
this

2701
02:39:59,670 --> 02:40:01,920
John C Dvorak: lie I still have
another news clip before you

2702
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:02,910
take us out I was something

2703
02:40:02,940 --> 02:40:06,270
Adam Curry: no no because I want
you to end with something like

2704
02:40:06,300 --> 02:40:07,260
I'm going I don't have

2705
02:40:07,260 --> 02:40:09,720
John C Dvorak: something like I
have I have a what what clip

2706
02:40:10,920 --> 02:40:14,340
Adam Curry: Okay, do we want it
shouldn't that be the last clip

2707
02:40:14,430 --> 02:40:15,300
the what what clip?

2708
02:40:15,810 --> 02:40:18,000
John C Dvorak: Okay it's it's
actually a good last clip

2709
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:19,140
because you go what

2710
02:40:19,800 --> 02:40:24,450
Adam Curry: will go what what
yep, yep. Here is Dr. Osterholm

2711
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:28,110
that you know he has he has long
COVID Yes long COVID Yeah

2712
02:40:28,110 --> 02:40:30,570
John C Dvorak: the guy would
they got sick? Yeah right sick

2713
02:40:30,570 --> 02:40:30,690
as

2714
02:40:30,690 --> 02:40:34,680
Adam Curry: a dog. He was he was
the OG we're all gonna die. We

2715
02:40:34,680 --> 02:40:38,520
need to get vaccinated. met him
at Joe Rogan first time I went

2716
02:40:38,520 --> 02:40:43,710
on 3 million people gonna die.
Oh gee, he has a podcast. And oh

2717
02:40:43,710 --> 02:40:45,930
man COVID is it's all COVID.

2718
02:40:45,960 --> 02:40:49,230
Unknown: The researchers found
the SARS cov to can infect and

2719
02:40:49,230 --> 02:40:52,500
replicate and white blood cells,
leading to an inflammatory

2720
02:40:52,500 --> 02:40:55,170
response that is known to
increase the risk of heart

2721
02:40:55,170 --> 02:40:58,410
attacks and stroke. And this
elevated risk can last up to a

2722
02:40:58,410 --> 02:41:01,710
year after infection. In
additional research that has

2723
02:41:01,710 --> 02:41:04,530
been done, it has been
demonstrated that individuals up

2724
02:41:04,530 --> 02:41:08,820
to one year after their COVID
case, have an increased risk for

2725
02:41:08,820 --> 02:41:13,260
cardiovascular events,
cardiovascular events, as

2726
02:41:13,260 --> 02:41:17,280
specifically that is at least
seven times higher for COVID

2727
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:20,700
related infections and for
influenza. We have been

2728
02:41:20,700 --> 02:41:23,820
observing an increase in heart
attacks and stroke with COVID 19

2729
02:41:23,820 --> 02:41:26,670
infections throughout the
pandemic. But until now, there

2730
02:41:26,670 --> 02:41:30,720
was no concrete biologic
evidence linking COVID-19 to

2731
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:34,560
this increase, as the authors of
the paper explain their findings

2732
02:41:34,560 --> 02:41:38,700
provide for the first time a
direct mechanistic link between

2733
02:41:38,700 --> 02:41:42,780
COVID 19 infection and the heart
complications that provokes

2734
02:41:43,230 --> 02:41:46,650
Adam Curry: vascular problems.
We knew this, we knew this a

2735
02:41:46,650 --> 02:41:50,160
year of more than a year ago.
And we got it from these two

2736
02:41:50,160 --> 02:41:53,820
women. Do you know anything
about COVID Dix shrinkage?

2737
02:41:53,940 --> 02:42:00,540
Unknown: Yeah, okay, so remember
that it's proof it's COVID COVID

02:42:04,860 --> 02:42:05,820
at that mark

2741
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:10,050
Adam Curry: that's why I stopped
it all right. What give me some

2742
02:42:10,290 --> 02:42:10,890

hell is poster home Oh, Mr.
White He's making himself sick

2745
02:42:18,900 --> 02:42:21,840

right that's a very good you

2746
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:24,630
know how you can just get
yourself again using that term

2747
02:42:24,630 --> 02:42:28,410

sorry for him okay, this is this
is the update on Niger this our

2749
02:42:33,510 --> 02:42:36,480
African story right at the end
of the show, so people can't

2750
02:42:36,480 --> 02:42:40,470
complain you know, you can't is
it Niger on the show and we got

02:42:40,470 --> 02:42:43,770
the funny stuff coming up after
this is Nigeria or nice air.

2752
02:42:44,100 --> 02:42:49,590
Nice air. Okay. So this is the
nice air clip and it just the

2753
02:42:49,590 --> 02:42:53,610
update and it's interesting
because of the very ending the

2754
02:42:53,610 --> 02:42:56,640
little ending at the end make
sure go what, here we go

2755
02:42:56,850 --> 02:42:59,910
Unknown: share, the first set of
French soldiers have started to

2756
02:42:59,910 --> 02:43:03,810
withdraw from the country after
orders by nushares military

2757
02:43:03,810 --> 02:43:07,260
junta following their July
takeover in the capital in the

2758
02:43:07,260 --> 02:43:10,920
AMA. Residents welcomed the
French soldiers departure

2759
02:43:11,460 --> 02:43:15,990
event today this batch of French
soldiers who arrived in who will

2760
02:43:15,990 --> 02:43:20,520
God willing shortly be taking to
the role to return home and is

2761
02:43:20,520 --> 02:43:23,670
only the culmination of a
struggle that the people have

2762
02:43:23,670 --> 02:43:28,230
engaged in. People are on their
feet to demand the departure of

2763
02:43:28,230 --> 02:43:32,640
the French soldiers from Niger
soil, because one thing is

2764
02:43:32,640 --> 02:43:37,170
certain Niger remains for the
people love Niger.

2765
02:43:37,650 --> 02:43:40,650
This comes as the US formally
designated the ouster of

2766
02:43:40,650 --> 02:43:43,710
President Mohammed Bazoom and
military takeover as a coup

2767
02:43:43,710 --> 02:43:47,310
suspending a two new Share. But
US officials say they do not

2768
02:43:47,310 --> 02:43:51,030
plan to remove any of its 1000
military personnel from new

2769
02:43:51,030 --> 02:43:51,480
Share.

2770
02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:58,620
John C Dvorak: What what I said?
What are we doing? We have we're

2771
02:43:58,920 --> 02:44:01,440
just so the French are rousted
and we still have our troops

2772
02:44:01,440 --> 02:44:05,670
there. And we don't plan to move
anything. Yeah, screw you. We

2773
02:44:05,670 --> 02:44:08,280
got our place and then we're
still you know, we're a kick ass

2774
02:44:08,280 --> 02:44:12,690
country. It's unbelievable.

2775
02:44:14,970 --> 02:44:17,490
Adam Curry: You know, they say
that the Empire is in decline,

2776
02:44:17,490 --> 02:44:19,350
and sometimes it kind of feels
like see

2777
02:44:19,350 --> 02:44:20,850
John C Dvorak: no evidence of
this.

2778
02:44:23,280 --> 02:44:25,830
Adam Curry: Well, maybe for you
in California, everything's all

2779
02:44:25,830 --> 02:44:30,480
hunky dory. I don't know. It's

Unknown: But okay,

2781
02:44:31,380 --> 02:44:34,320
Adam Curry: there's no real
empire that EU they're in

02:44:34,320 --> 02:44:37,590

02:44:51,960 --> 02:44:56,190
else that I think we've we've
kind of covered it all. For

02:45:05,130 --> 02:45:07,500
of show mixes and we got

2792
02:45:07,950 --> 02:45:09,840
John C Dvorak: these are
beauties by the way for people

2793

we'd kind of get our summer
Finally, I'm John C. Dvorak.

2806

Adam Curry: We return on

Unknown: Sunday. Right here.

Adam Curry: Please remember us
at devora.org/na Until then,

2809
02:46:07,230 --> 02:46:09,780
adios mofos who we who he adds

2810
02:46:21,420 --> 02:46:27,030
Unknown: I'm gonna I'm gonna
bomb bomb. I'm gonna I'm gonna

I'm gonna bomb bomb out of I'm
gonna. I'm gonna I'm gonna bomb

2812
02:46:34,470 --> 02:46:38,760
bomb. I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm
gonna.

2813
02:47:25,890 --> 02:47:44,430
You 30 to 50% of the population
had relations back to Germany.

2814
02:47:44,910 --> 02:47:48,750
So there had to be this very
clever propaganda campaign. It's

2815
02:47:48,750 --> 02:47:51,090
known today as babies on
bayonets.

2816
02:47:53,490 --> 02:47:57,930
I can think of my nephew
gathered in the mud, the bodies

2817
02:47:57,960 --> 02:48:01,800
of lifeless children suspected
of being poisoned in a chemical

2818
02:48:01,800 --> 02:48:05,820
attack, allegedly orchestrated
by their own government. We have

2819
02:48:05,820 --> 02:48:06,270
all seen

2820
02:48:06,270 --> 02:48:09,210
the reports of the terrible
chemical weapons attack in

2821
02:48:09,210 --> 02:48:13,200
Syria. They took the babies out
of incubators, and let the

2822
02:48:13,200 --> 02:48:13,740
children to

2823
02:48:15,870 --> 02:48:19,140
the incubators. And they were
thrown out of the incubators so

2824
02:48:19,140 --> 02:48:23,280
that Kuwait could be
systematically dismantled 14

2825
02:48:23,370 --> 02:48:27,630
babies and young children babies
being bathed in kill to even

2826
02:48:27,660 --> 02:48:28,230
beheaded

2827
02:48:28,620 --> 02:48:30,450
babies and toddlers were found

2828
02:48:30,480 --> 02:48:34,230
babies and young children with
their heads copper children with

2829
02:48:34,350 --> 02:48:35,160
their head

2830
02:48:35,160 --> 02:48:37,470
deep headed. Babies found

2831
02:48:37,470 --> 02:48:39,720
dead next to that carts that has
been

2832
02:48:39,750 --> 02:48:43,770
through for civilized countries
of this world to do everything

2833
02:48:43,770 --> 02:48:50,010
within their power to remove
this scourge. From the face of

2834
02:48:50,010 --> 02:48:50,490
our Earth,

2835
02:48:50,610 --> 02:48:53,580
emotions drive wars, not facts.

2836
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:57,540
It is sort of evil that it's
beyond comprehension. Beyond the

2837
02:48:57,540 --> 02:48:58,620
Leon the lake.

2838
02:49:01,050 --> 02:49:03,000
It took the babies and
incubators

2839
02:49:03,300 --> 02:49:04,020
is a bomb.

2840
02:49:04,259 --> 02:49:06,779
This is a fuse. This bomb has to
be filled.

2841
02:49:07,259 --> 02:49:17,549
Thomas is the original snack.
Pay attention please. It's a

2842
02:49:17,579 --> 02:49:25,919
classic tale of an authoritarian
and this little tale of

2843
02:49:25,919 --> 02:49:38,039
extremism. And sadly, so many of
those extremists are determined

2844
02:49:38,099 --> 02:49:43,589
to return to a place where you
know people could be in charge

2845
02:49:43,589 --> 02:49:49,859
of their lives feel empowered,
say what they want. So it is

2846
02:49:49,859 --> 02:49:50,549
like a tautology.

2847
02:49:55,710 --> 02:49:59,460
In order to try to end our
democracy, there needs to be

2848
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:06,990
more multiprogramming of the
cult members gun control and

2849
02:50:06,990 --> 02:50:12,450
climate change in the economy
and taxes. What is it you want

2850
02:50:14,580 --> 02:50:20,700
to make America great again?
Tonight don't say that

2851
02:50:37,320 --> 02:50:41,490
oppo vora.org/in A

2852
02:50:42,300 --> 02:50:44,880
there is just not enough of
