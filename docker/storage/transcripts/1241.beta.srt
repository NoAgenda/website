1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,999
oh this is no agenda northern
Silicon

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,999
Valley where everybody's
wearing masks

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,999
and you know there's a smile
under that

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,999
mask I'm Jessie Dvorak yes the
right

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,999
topic off the bat I am
unmuzzled I will

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,999
not be muzzled and you don't
have to be

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,999
muzzled the official word is in
wearing

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,999
a mask in public is not desired

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,999
this is dr. Anthony Fauci on 60
minutes

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,999
right now in the United States
people

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,999
should not be walking around
with masks

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,999
you're sure of it because
people are

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,999
listening really know closely
to the

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,999
right now people should not be
worried

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,999
there's no reason to be walking
around

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,999
with a mask when you're in the
middle of

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,999
an outbreak wearing a mask
might make

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,999
people feel a little bit better
and it

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,999
might even block a droplet but
it's not

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,999
providing the perfect
protection that

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,999
people think that it is and
often there

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,999
are unintended consequences
people keep

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,999
fiddling with the mask and they
keep

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,999
touching their face then can
you get

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,999
some schmutz and sort of
staying inside

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,999
there or of course but when you
think

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,999
mask you should think of health
care

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,999
providers needing them and
people who

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,999
are ill there can be no
question no

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,999
masks and as a handy resource I
have

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,999
made no masks dot-org

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,999
and if you go there I shall do
it myself

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,999
no masks org you will see a
copy of that

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,999
video you will have an audio
there and

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,999
you can bookmark and bookmark
that as a

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,999
handy little resource when
someone gives

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,999
you crap you say oh yeah

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,999
look at tony fauci bitch

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,999
I like to wear you put a byline
on it

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,999
[Laughter] 

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,999
it's not really by design that's

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,999
otherwise you can't have a
title without

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,999
the byline that's just some way
the

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,999
system is cheap generator no
excuse me

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,999
this is the freedom controller
not some

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,999
cheap generator thank you very
much your

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,999
controller you should be able
to have it

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,999
so you should be able to
control it yes

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,999
I know I know I'm working on it
I'm

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,999
working on it anyway so there
it is that

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,999
is the definitive answer it is
from

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,999
Asics nothing has changed since
then

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,999
ouchy in fact is not even on
the scene

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,999
he is in quarantine how handy
is that

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,999
when everybody wants out just
when

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,999
everybody wants him to testify

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,999
all of a sudden yeah no I
thought yes

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,999
someone was exposed so I have
to self

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,999
quarantine little things it's
kind of

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:15,999
fun 

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,999
timing so everyone is not
walking around

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,999
here in a mask I would say
about 50

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,999
percent of the people yeah well
you have

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,999
oh you should private lands
maybe it

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,999
could be right I mean here it's
a

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,999
hundred percent yeah I accept
some of

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,999
the homeless and they're not
walking

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,999
around in messages yelling at
people

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,999
yeah and shaking their fists
everyone

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,999
else is wearing a mask happily
they're

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,999
all happily wearing masks this
is this

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,999
is so not a good idea the more
I think

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,999
about it now that now that we
have the

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,999
official medical advice I mean
you agree

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,999
with me right that is the guy
who makes

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,999
the call correct

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,999
he is the referee oh okay yes
he's the

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,999
referee he's the guy that makes
the call

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,999
he said no mask it was very
clear we

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,999
have a mask ordinance in Austin
which is

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,999
illegal because the the state
overruled

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,999
it but still they're gonna try
and shame

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,999
you and Duke on all kinds of
Democrats

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,999
I don't know if it's just
because the

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,999
Democrats this that's what is
reason

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,999
around here it's something in
the water

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,999
and MS the Republicans try not
to so you

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,999
think that's the delineation
it's not

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,999
just people who are won't be
muzzled let

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,999
sighs yep yeah yes sadly you're
probably

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,999
somewhat right but but the
protest is

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,999
everywhere people want to they
want out

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,999
they're done they don't want to
hear it

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,999
anymore they want to get back
to work

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,999
they want to get back to life
they're

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,999
just not taking it anymore that
boots on

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,999
the ground Pennsylvania from
one of our

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,999
producers gonna kill people
people have

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,999
had enough the overwhelming
majority of

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,999
deaths in Pennsylvania have
been in

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,999
nursing homes the hospitals
were never

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,999
overrun in fact they are
furloughing

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,999
people and hospitals are losing
money by

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,999
the billions due to cancelled
elective

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,999
surgeries not unique to
Pennsylvania we

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,999
were told that even with social

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,999
distancing there was a huge
chance would

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,999
overload the system and it
simply didn't

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,999
happen and yet the governor just

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,999
extended the stay-at-home order
until

111
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,999
June 4th without any data to
back it up

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,999
three four five man the day
that eight

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,999
comes I'll be I'll be Hootin and

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,999
Hollerin seven cars seven car
economy on

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,999
we have a we have a friend that
works

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,999
for NHS mm-hmm and she says
that it's

117
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,999
same thing

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,999
hospitals are empty I'm suppose
it must

119
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,999
be a pocket someplace where
there's a

120
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,999
hospital full and she says
what's

121
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,999
pathetic is that people look
like

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,999
there's a one example recently
there's

123
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,999
this big empty Hospital places
big is

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,999
empty and some guy had a stroke
so they

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,999
brought him in but because of
all the

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,999
rules his wife or nobody can
see him so

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,999
he's stuck in there by himself
when he's

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,999
half out of it and he's
wondering where

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,999
everybody is he's wondering if
he's dead

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,999
my dad where's my wife and my
dad and

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,999
he's just pathetic

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,999
she says this is so sad and
this is

133
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,999
going on all over the Great
Britain with

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,999
these people because you can't
just go

135
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,999
and see him so

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,999
if your assertion is correct
and I'm and

137
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,999
I'm gonna say in California I
bet it is

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,999
that it's political the mask is
a

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,999
political thing that is so it
political

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,999
grease because the people who
wear the

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,999
master responsible and the
people don't

142
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,999
wear the mask and want to kill
everybody

143
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,999
they're horrible Republicans
okay so you

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,999
could say that both of these
groups are

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,999
acting rather cultish right one
says

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,999
we're the smart cult and you
gotta wear

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,999
the mask and the other says
we're not a

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,999
part of the cult and they have
their own

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,999
cult I guess you know true I
don't think

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,999
that I think that non masks
words are

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,999
not part of a cult okay well
that even

152
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,999
strengthens this argument
truthstream

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,999
media put together a cool
little video

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,999
to the shownotes

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,999
in a show notes calm just a
talking cat

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,999
ladies and gentlemen do not
despair no

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,999
agenda show has the talking cat
coming

158
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,999
up in just a moment stand by
they did a

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,999
bit on cults and how people are

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,999
initiated so initiation rituals
into

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,999
cults are they they kind of
mashed up

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,999
the idea of what's going on now
with the

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,999
video while reading a very
traditional

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,999
piece of work about initiation
real

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,999
rituals into cults and I just
picked up

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,999
this one-minute clip from it
necessary

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,999
for new members to function
properly in

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,999
the society they are being
inducted into

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,999
are all imbued at this time

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,999
repetition is typical as its
use helps

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,999
hammer the spell home the
wearing of

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,999
masks may be required

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,999
masking has traditionally
played an

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:42,999
important role in rituals of
this kind

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,999
and hastening the suppression
of ego to

176
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,999
help facilitate a death of the
old

177
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,999
identity before the
identification with

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,999
and manifestation of a new one
disguised

179
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,999
under a mask and hidden away the

180
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,999
initiate is more easily able to

181
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,999
transcend the self pushed
further toward

182
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,999
that invisible line between the
physical

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,999
and spiritual realms I'm all in
on this

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,999
now I'm so no no this mask
thing is a

185
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,999
very bad idea the very bad idea
people

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,999
have to wake up to what's going
on here

187
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,999
we're so preconditioned forget
just the

188
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,999
one it's just how bad I think
it is

189
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,999
especially around here you
don't know if

190
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,999
you see it there but I'm sure
you do you

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,999
have these morons and I'll use
the term

192
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,999
driving in their cars by
themselves with

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,999
masks oh yes John we have that
the

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,999
windows are up yes we well you
don't

195
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,999
want the ronan to fly in and
hit you in

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,999
the face do you know and also
the air is

197
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,999
off no no you can't have any
air on it's

198
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,999
just your hotbox and down the
road with

199
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,999
your mask yes I've seen it

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,999
so we make kind of a sport of
it now to

201
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,999
see okay did you go in without
a mask

202
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,999
yeah hell yeah I did people
aren't

203
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,999
yelling yet they're not not
yelling yet

204
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,999
but anyway the preconditioning
producer

205
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,999
Justin losing obviously a gamer
or he

206
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,999
was a gamer around 2000 said

207
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,999
so much stuff that has been in
the in

208
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,999
the psyche for so long this is
the game

209
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,999
dos dos X that gets some kind
of combat

210
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,999
game whenever and here's a
little clip

211
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,999
your appointment to FEMA should
be

212
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,999
finalized within the week I've
already

213
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,999
discussed the matter with the
senator I

214
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,999
take it he was agreeable he
didn't

215
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,999
really have a choice

216
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,999
has he been infected yes most
certainly

217
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,999
when I mentioned that we could
put him

218
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,999
on the priority list for the
ambrosia

219
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,999
vaccine he was so willing it
was almost

220
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,999
pathetic this play the rioting
is

221
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,999
intensifying to the point where
we may

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,999
not be able to contain it

223
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,999
why contain it let it spill
over to the

224
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,999
schools and churches let the
bodies pile

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,999
up in the streets in the end
they'll beg

226
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,999
us to save them going on for a
while

227
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,999
Deus Ex actually I
mispronounced it oh

228
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,999
yeah but how differents how
different

229
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,999
does it sound from New York
City this is

230
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,999
producer Nick who caught the
giant voice

231
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,999
recording going off as people
were

232
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,999
starting to kind of congregate
getting

233
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,999
too close to each other you
know wanting

234
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,999
to say something to their
government

235
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,999
[Applause] 

236
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,999
[Music] 

237
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,999
and you are ordered to disperse
if you

238
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,999
fail to this person yeah this is

239
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,999

from there you will be ticketed
and yeah

241
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,999
the red zone is for parking

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,999
[Music] 

243
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,999

00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,999
that announcement at the
airport's they

245
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,999
play it inside the airport only
a JFK

246
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,999

do it Oakland so you've even
got yeah

248
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,999

262
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,999
actually save lives

public is not

264
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,999
effective my name is dr. Jeff
Markey and

265
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,999
I'm here representing thousands
of

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,999
physicians across the country
whose

267
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,999
voices are being silenced
because we

268
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,999
don't agree with the mainstream
media

269
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,999
and the experts who are telling
us what

270
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,999
to do

271
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,999
never in the history of this
great

272
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,999
Republic have we quarantined
the healthy

273
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,999
never in the history of this
great

274
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,999
Republic have we told
churchgoers and

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,999
it's illegal for you to
exercise your

276
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,999
First Amendment right of
freedom of

277
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,999
religion yet at the same time
it's

278
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,999
essential to keep pot
dispensaries open

279
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,999
never in the history of this
country

280
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,999
have we been told that you
can't go to

281
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,999
church because it's not
essential but

282
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,999
you can go get an abortion

283
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,999
never be fooled another country
have we

284
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,999
let criminals out of jail but
we've told

285
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,999
you you can't exercise your
Second

286
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,999
Amendment right and protect
yourself by

287
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,999
purchasing a firearm when
liquor stores

288
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,999
are deemed essential but your
businesses

289
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,999
are getting non-essential
there's

290
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,999
something wrong going on this
booklet

291
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,999
the Declaration of Independence
and our

292
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,999
US Constitution was never
designed to

293
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,999
restrain the people it was
designed to

294
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,999
restrain the government I can
inform you

295
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,999
the doctor has been demonetised
doctor

296
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,999
is a republic well there's that
but he

297
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,999
has he has some very valid
points and

298
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,999
he's he's making his point
heard but

299
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,999
there's somebody's got to do it
but

300
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,999
there's a lot of crazy stuff
going on

301
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,999
weird they're just even at a
local level

302
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,999
or the state level and like an
Austin a

303
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,999
mayoral level they just don't
want us to

304
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,999
get out they just want to come
up with

305
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,999
reasons to keep us in and now
we have

306
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,999
the trait at five G up well now
we have

307
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,999
the Tres act on the way House
House

308
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,999
Resolution D well and of course
it is

309
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,999
how it you can't make it up
it's House

310
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,999
Resolution 666 it's one six too
many and

311
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,999
here's the problem a lot of
people have

312
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,999
with it it will authorize the
Secretary

313
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,999
of Health and Human Services
toward

314
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,999
grants to eligible entities to
conduct

315
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,999
diagnostic testing for kovat 19
and

316
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,999
related activities such as
contact

317
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,999
tracing through mobile health
units and

318
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,999
and here comes as necessary at

319
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,999
individuals residences and for
other

320
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,999
purposes 

321
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,999
so they're putting together a
tracing

322
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,999
squad a hundred billion dollars
is the

323
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,999
proposal for this and it will
be yeah

324
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,999
exactly what it sounds like a
form of a

325
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,999
like the EU regulation like an
army and

326
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,999
so if if you've been identified
as

327
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,999
someone who

328
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,999
may have been in contact then
to come to

329
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,999
your house and test you and take

330
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,999
measures so what could these
measures be

331
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,999
well let's take you out of the
house and

332
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:29,999
lock you up

333
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,999
that's correct and this is
doctor Robert

334
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,999
Levin he is the health
secretary of

335
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,999
what's-his-name here a health
director

336
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,999
of Ventura County California
and here he

337
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,999
is talking and when you listen
to him

338
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,999
speak just and I've left a
little more

339
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,999
in this than I would have at the

340
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,999
beginning certainly he's like
mr. Rogers

341
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,999
and he's an ally I even have to

342
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,999
interrupt him he's so sickly at
telling

343
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,999
you what's going to happen I
mean it's a

344
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,999
real doctor and you just listen
to this

345
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,999
guy and what he's talking about
is quite

346
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,999
concerning we are beginning a
program

347
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,999
today and it's a pilot program
which

348
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,999
will certainly grow into
something

349
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,999
larger and larger and that is
community

350
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,999
contact tracing program we've
done

351
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,999
contact tracing all along that
a contact

352
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,999
is a person who's been exposed
to

353
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,999
someone that we document to
have the

354
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,999
kovat infection when we find
someone who

355
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,999
has a kovat infection those
people are

356
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,999
immediately isolated but we
also work

357
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,999
with them to figure out who
their

358
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,999
contacts were just the way he
says that

359
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,999
you know it if you if you have
the virus

360
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,999
okay you can be asymptomatic
maybe you

361
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,999
get tested but the way he makes
it sound

362
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,999
is like immediately isolated
luckily

363
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,999
because you have been doing
such a great

364
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,999
job of cooperating and staying
indoors

365
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,999
and staying isolated you've
been such

366
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,999
good little obedient servants
and slaves

367
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,999
it used to be there were ten
contacts at

368
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,999
least for every patient that we
would

369
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,999
find now it looks like there are

370
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,999
probably only two or three or
four

371
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,999
contacts not surprisingly so
good

372
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,999
very good Human Resources by
the way the

373
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,999
guy is not doing an interview
he's

374
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,999
speaking on stage this is how
he speaks

375
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,999
to his his County is his
subjects

376
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,999
because most people have been
staying

377
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,999
away from others saying that's
that's a

378
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,999
good news but the purpose of
this

379
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,999
program is to bring on people
we're

380
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,999
going to start with ten people
we may

381
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,999
bring on up to fifty or even
more just a

382
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,999
pilot project after all as the
program

383
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,999
grows and as we see the needs
for it as

384
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,999
we do more testing we will find
more and

385
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,999
more people who have kovat 19
and again

386
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,999
will isolate every one of them
and we

387
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,999
will find every one of their
contacts we

388
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,999
also realize that as we find
more

389
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,999
contacts some of the people we
find are

390
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,999
going to have trouble being
isolated for

391
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,999
instance if they live in a home
where

392
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,999
there's only one bathroom and
there are

393
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,999
three or four other people
living there

394
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,999
and those people don't have
kovat

395
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,999
infection we're not going to be
able to

396
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,999
keep the person in that home
every

397
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,999
person who we're isolating for
instance

398
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,999
needs to have their own
bathroom and so

399
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,999
we'll be moving people like
this into

400
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,999
other kinds of housing that we
have

401
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,999
available empty prison cells no
no no no

402
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,999
no no listen you don't call the
prison

403
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,999
cell anymore they'll also have
other

404
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,999
needs perhaps food whatever
it's gonna

405
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,999
be if the county will be there
to back

406
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,999
them up and to support them
yeah I think

407
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,999
you're right it's a prison cell
I think

408
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,999
that's exactly where you're
going and so

409
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,999
you know when you hear this and
you hear

410
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,999
you see this bill that is
coming our way

411
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,999
you gotta think the guys pretty
happy

412
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,999
about it it's like yeah I'm
gonna get

413
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,999
fund it's perfect reminds me of
this a

414
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,999
little bit if you think about

415
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,999
takes place within a strong
legal

416
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,999
framework we operate under the
rule of

417
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,999
law and are accountable for it
in some

418
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,999
countries secret intelligence
is used to

419
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,999
control their people in powers
it only

420
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,999
exists to protect their
freedoms protect

421
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,999
their freedoms

422
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,999
protect their freedoms protect
their

423
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,999
freedoms and that's why we're
doing in

424
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,999
citizen is to protect your
freedoms I

425
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,999
have no fear yeah yeah it's
gross okay

426
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,999
that's that unfortunately is
seems to be

427
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,999
where we're headed now we were
looking

428
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,999
for some names for uh for some
reason

429
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,999
that that really hit a mark and
you see

430
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,999
where I have this people
started coming

431
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,999
up with all kinds of cooler
names for

432
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,999
tracking so that we could kind
of sell

433
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,999
it a bit better so we have
social

434
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,999
interactive safety social
proximity

435
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,999
awareness when we need
something for

436
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,999
these troops we need a name for
them too

437
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,999
social density squad I had one
I forgot

438
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,999
to write it down because
somebody wrote

439
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,999
one and I thought was quite
good first a

440
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,999
bunch of yeah we should put a
webpage

441
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,999
together and you could put by
Adam Curry

442
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,999
on it screw you door I could go
to it

443
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,999
anyway I had a very infected
eye oh yes

444
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,999
you had a big eyeball was
swollen up and

445
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,999
you could even barely see
through it it

446
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,999
was causing problems with this
show show

447
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,999
actually suffered yes there
were certain

448
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,999
buttons like I could not hit
with

449
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,999
accuracy my eye hand
coordination and

450
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,999
gotten thrown totally out of
whack so

451
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,999
after three days of you know as
the

452
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,999
eyelid was all swollen than the
socket

453
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,999
we were in a big boxing match
yes on the

454
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,999
losing end of the match and so
now my

455
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,999
whole face is kind of swelling
up and

456
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,999
like all right now we got this
oh it's

457
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,999
the hair that was my secret and
by the

458
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,999
way little Richard died and
talking

459
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,999
about a guy with a big head

460
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,999
yeah Little Richard man he did
a lot

461
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,999
he's a lot for America he
really won't

462
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,999
bamboo yeah he did a lot anyway
so you

463
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,999
know being a podcaster the you
know the

464
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,999
insurance scene is not all that
easy in

465
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,999
a while back the keeper and I
found this

466
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,999
new outfit from that's actually
a couple

467
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,999
of Silicon Valley guys and it's
called

468
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,999
decent and we may have talked
about on

469
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,999
the show and well they
basically give

470
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,999
you five hundred dollars a
month per

471
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,999
person disaster insurance but
you know

472
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,999
they they do chip in for some
medication

473
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,999
and stuff and whatever it ideal
if

474
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,999
something bad happens you know
I'll have

475
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,999
to figure out the eight
thousand dollar

476
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,999
deductible the insurance kicks
in and

477
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,999
besides I typically go to
doctor wrong

478
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,999
the voodoo doctor anyway it's
not

479
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,999
covered so but one of their
selling

480
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,999
points is unlimited

481
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,999
telemedicine appointments so I
think

482
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,999
well here's my chance I'm going
to have

483
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,999
to do this which of course yeah
good

484
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:35,999
point 

485
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,999
involved downloading the app
which I

486
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,999
have a special phone for which
is goes

487
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,999
off after the usage downloaded
the app

488
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,999
and I have to tell you wait
hold on a

489
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,999
second you can't do this on
your regular

490
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,999
computer a desktop yes you can

491
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,999
you can't can you can't there's
a link

492
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,999
and everything one guy I wanted
to have

493
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,999
the full experience so I could
report on

494
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,999
it on the show this is the new
hot thing

495
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,999
telemedicine and up on the
screen pop

496
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,999
said dr. Sam robot doc now no I
think he

497
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,999
may have been he's maybe a
Turkish

498
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,999
descent but he's in Vegas and
he owns

499
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,999
the telemedicine company he's
also the

500
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,999
CEO and he had a bow tie which
tells you

501
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,999
he's an inventor and that was
fun he's

502
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,999
invented a device that you
connect to

503
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,999
your phone and then he can
listen to

504
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,999
your heartbeat and take your
temperature

505
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,999
and God knows what else maybe
stimulate

506
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,999
but I had a really good
experience with

507
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,999
this and he says you know the
thing is

508
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,999
we can talk as long as you want
there's

509
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,999
no limit and and he told me uh
well I

510
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,999
didn't say confidentially but
anyway he

511
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,999
said that he only charges $10
per

512
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,999
telemedicine visit to the

513
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,999
insurer's he says you have no
idea how

514
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,999
we make it up on volume so we
got tens

515
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,999
of thousands of customers and
they're

516
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,999
calling with prettiness simple
things

517
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,999
and for me was like okay I see
why

518
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,999
you're calling the guy do you
see the

519
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,999
problem you know three
questions and

520
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,999
then get the drops and by the
end of the

521
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,999
afternoon it was already
starting to

522
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,999
clear up I was impressed I'm
not a guy

523
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,999
who likes to go to the doctor
for

524
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,999
anything 

525
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,999
yeah well it's not as a
dangerous place

526
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,999
it's a very dangerous place

527
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,999
it was quite yeah I there's
something to

528
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:20,999
it 

529
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,999
and I and these guys are trying
to

530
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,999
figure out a different business
model by

531
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,999
making it more affordable I
don't know

532
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,999
if they're actually making
money but it

533
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,999
certainly is a hell of a lot
cheaper

534
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,999
than lots of other routes I've
seen and

535
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,999
your eyeballs okay and my
eyeball is

536
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,999
doing quite well thank you got
some

537
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,999
antibiotics and I'm rocking and
rolling

538
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,999
well did he tell you what this
problem

539
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,999
was what my problem will rot
the eyeball

540
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,999
yes he had a name for it which I

541
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,999
promptly forgot but it is
essentially

542
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,999
inflammation of the eyelid from

543
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,999
allergies with a histamine and
then you

544
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,999
rub it and then if you rub it
then he

545
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,999
gets screwed up and you're
screwed yeah

546
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,999
yeah Texas syndrome yes indeed
Texas

547
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,999
syndrome yeah okay I have a
phrase that

548
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,999
I think we will be hearing a
phrase from

549
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,999
the shades no I think well no
it's gonna

550
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,999
be a phrase from the future and
I've

551
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,999
read it a couple times and I'm
like wow

552
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,999
are they really pushing this
and maybe

553
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,999
I'm wrong but the recovery
through

554
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,999
prevention which is just the
most new

555
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,999
speak I've ever heard recovery
through

556
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,999
prevention which of course you
know what

557
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,999
that leads to

558
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,999
yeah locking in jail we let the

559
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,999
prisoners out now the vaccine
of course

560
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,999
it leads you straight to
vaccines

561
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,999
yes exactly vaccines which
totally that

562
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,999
earlier clip well I'm gonna
play this

563
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,999
one for you and this will kind
of

564
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,999
finalize the getting back to
work part

565
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,999
even though everywhere
everywhere in the

566
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,999
world people are just giving up
their

567
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,999
get their walking out of their
homes

568
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,999
they've had it am sir damn is
Rotterdam

569
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,999
it's no the UK isn't is
different the UK

570
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,999
I think they shoot you on the
spot

571
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,999
they're really locked down over
there

572
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,999
hey I have a couple UK reports
okay

573
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,999
we'll get to it after we listen
to the

574
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,999
only way we can get back the
only way

575
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,999
the world would get back to
normal

576
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,999
ladies and gentlemen we have to
listen

577
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,999
to the guru William Gates in my
lifetime

578
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,999
there this will be the greatest
economic

579
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,999
kit but you don't have a choice
people

580
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,999
act like you have a choice
people don't

581
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,999
feel like going to the stadium
when they

582
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,999
might get infected you know
it's not the

583
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,999
government who speak for
yourself pansy

584
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,999
boy saying okay just ignore
this disease

585
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,999
and you know people are deeply
affected

586
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,999
by seeing these deaths by
knowing they

587
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,999
could be part of the
transmission chain

588
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,999
and in old people their parents
that

589
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,999
grandparents could be affected
by this

590
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,999
and so you don't laugh at about
well I

591
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,999
think that he's actually
laughing

592
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,999
because it's a tell some people
have

593
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,999
brought the hammer down on me
and say no

594
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,999
it's because of his Parkinson's
like

595
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,999
well that may be but oh ok when
do we do

596
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,999
his Parkinson's began about a
decade ago

597
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,999
yeah and they're gone as far as
I can

598
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,999
see I know bill before he when
he was so

599
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,999
giving speeches about hobbies
make money

600
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,999
by selling code and I've seen
and I've

601
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,999
seen lucky buy for someone very
young

602
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,999
yeah oh really that laugh has
always

603
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,999
been there and went and when
would he do

604
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,999
the line and Andy in
appropriate smile

605
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,999
right in the middle of a
sentence what

606
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,999
the right so what is that then
if you've

607
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,999
been around it well I think
that the

608
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,999
idea that it's a tell is
probably the

609
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,999
closest it gets my knowing me
just I

610
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,999
mean you could say well it's
just a

611
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,999
nervous laugh but why does it
show up

612
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,999
when it shows up because always
shows up

613
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,999
at a tell moment I think he's
giddy

614
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,999
about the whole idea he's giddy
about

615
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,999
people being afraid

616
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,999
giddy about the only solution
being his

617
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,999
giddy ass vaca Nations well I
think

618
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,999
that's a valid interpretation I
could be

619
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,999
by knowing they could be part
of the

620
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,999
transmission chain and in old
people

621
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,999
their parents or grandparents
could be

622
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,999
affected by this and so you
don't you

623
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,999
know you don't get to say
ignore what's

624
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,999
going on here there are there
will be

625
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,999
the ability particularly in rich

626
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,999
countries to open up it things
are done

627
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,999
well over the next few months
few months

628
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,999
for the world at large normalcy
only

629
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,999
returns when we largely
vaccinated the

630
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,999
entire global population and
and so you

631
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,999
know although there's a lot of
work on

632
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,999
testing a lot of work on drugs
that were

633
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,999
involved with you know trying
to achieve

634
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,999
that ambitious goal which has
never been

635
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,999
done for the vaccine that rises
to the

636
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,999
top of the list

637
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,999
this indoctrination from dr.
bill is so

638
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,999
deep that people are buying
into it I

639
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,999
think part of this is the
reason why

640
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,999
even when cuz pouchy is he's
compromised

641
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,999
he's a trump guy he's got trump
goo on

642
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,999
him she's not a trump no no no
I think

643
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,999
foul Chi is now being pushed
away and

644
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,999
he's being seen as a turncoat
just like

645
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,999
Burks I'm telling you the you
should

646
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,999
know out there foul Chi is
really not

647
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,999
this questions about him he
won't go to

648
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,999
the house for his testimony now
he's at

649
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,999
home now

650
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,999
no no bill Gates is still the
ultimate

651
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,999
guy he dr. bill he knows
everything

652
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,999
people are getting sick a bill
and you

653
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,999
only have to ask someone like
Sean Penn

654
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,999
who appeared on the view who
appeared on

655
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,999
the view to an outlier and
using that as

656
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,999
your example it's still
Hollywood its

657
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,999
Hollywood I just want you to
hear the

658
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,999
programming Sean Penn I know
Sean Penn I

659
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,999
got remind me one of these days
to tell

660
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,999
me Sean Penn story on the MGM
grand air

661
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,999
but for now theory is on the
view as

662
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,999
somebody who has seen government

663
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,999
response to crises

664
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,999
first hand how do you think this

665
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,999
administration Shan has been
helping and

666
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,999
handling kovat and and what
worries you

667
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,999
the most well on federal level
I think

668
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,999
that one thing that certainly
should be

669
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,999
much more robust is in the
defense

670
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,999
production Act manufacturing
just listen

671
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,999
to it and kids I believe that
if we had

672
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,999
that on the kind of level with
which

673
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,999
that Act was used in the past
for war

674
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,999
efforts that there'd be no
question but

675
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,999
that we could test what in fact
give

676
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,999
multiple tests over a series of
weeks to

677
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,999
every American there's no
question we

678
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,999
have a model that's that we've
been able

679
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,999
to push out and with that
you're using

680
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,999
the combination of local
governance and

681
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,999
community organizations or NGOs
if it

682
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,999
would work on a small
municipality level

683
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,999
as it would in a big city or in
rural

684
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,999
areas yeah no Shawn there's no
way we're

685
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,999
going to get multiple tests for
every

686
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,999
man woman and child in the
United States

687
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,999
and and I gotta appreciate the
guy has

688
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,999
local teams here's a score I
think his

689
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,999
name was group and and they
they do a

690
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,999
lot of good things but no you
you're

691
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,999
drinking the kool-aid man it's
not

692
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,999
feasible but then again no yes
nobody's

693
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,999
did this Universal vaccine is
it the

694
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,999
whole world is gonna be
vaccinated is

695
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,999
never the whole world's never
been

696
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,999
vaccinated for anything
especially when

697
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,999
nobody in Africa even trusts
bill again

698
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,999
he's talking about testing now
not VAX

699
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,999
no no I'm talking about backing
up

700
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,999
because you didn't let me get
that look

701
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,999
jab in there well bill or
something go

702
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,999
back go ahead you jab all
you're one of

703
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,999
dr. bill it's bullcrap

704
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,999
well Canada is there's gonna be
more

705
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,999
people walk march in the
streets against

706
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,999
any universal vaccine Trump I
totally

707
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,999
subscribe to the Trump thesis
which I

708
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,999
kind of think where I made know
where it

709
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,999
comes from but it's been
observed before

710
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,999
this thing is just gonna go away

711
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,999
it's not gonna be here next year

712
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,999
the Canada is already talking
about

713
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,999
making the vaccine mandatory
for all

714
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,999
citizens but Canada this guy's
applied

715
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,999
bend over and hey hey hey not
all cand a

716
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,999
Navy ins not all of them they
know who

717
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,999
they are I have a second part
of this if

718
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,999
you just want to laugh a little
more the

719
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,999
fear has also been that all we
do the

720
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,999
fear but this shows you that
not Bill

721
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,999
Gates the yeah that is kind of
what we

722
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,999
do this shows you what right
what the

723
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,999
programming does if you only if
listen

724
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,999
he's appearing on the view you
have to

725
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,999
think he's probably getting his
input

726
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,999
from one-sided sources at this
point but

727
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,999
Sean yes yes so you know his
fear level

728
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,999
is also at a point that is just
off the

729
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,999
scale and unwarranted which
looks do you

730
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,999
saw this she looks nervous and
scared

731
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,999
not at all well I don't think
we need to

732
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,999
attach a face of personality or
what

733
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,999
somebody was sending on their
social

734
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,999
media to be able to identify an
active

735
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,999
shooter an active shooter is
anything

736
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,999
that is continuing to to kill
people and

737
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,999
our brothers and sisters and
fathers and

738
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,999
daughters and sons this is this
virus is

739
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,999
the active shooter and if we
were I

740
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,999
think that if we could wrap our
head

741
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,999
around it in that way and
understand

742
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,999
that it's principally putting
in the

743
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,999
radical people of color

744
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,999
elderly people young people
it's racist

745
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,999
in randomly selecting all of us
but you

746
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,999
see what he's doing there he's
the way I

747
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,999
hear at night I think I'm
hearing what

748
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,999
he's thinking is this is active
shooter

749
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,999
and look at it he almighty it
would have

750
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,999
been better if you said and
active

751
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,999
shooters also target black
people that's

752
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,999
almost what he's saying the
programming

753
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,999
is so deep on that man anyway
with with

754
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,999
or without the vaccine it's all
gonna be

755
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,999
okay especially New York

756
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,999
we're gonna get get back we're
gonna

757
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,999
bring our city back and we're
gonna

758
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,999
bring in the best people to
help our

759
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,999
children when we are reopening
schools

760
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,999
let's Oakland a better school
and let's

761
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,999
open a smarter education system
and I

762
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,999
want to thank the Bill and
Melinda Gates

763
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,999
Foundation will be working with
them on

764
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,999
this project is in everywhere
he's like

765
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,999
yeah we got a city down sitting
down

766
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,999
bring in the Scholastic
Services he can

767
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,999
repurpose common core but he's
a genius

768
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,999
I just knew that Cuomo was
jizan on Bill

769
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,999
Gates is a visionary ways and
his ideas

770
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,999
and thoughts on technology and
education

771
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,999
he's spoken about for years but
I think

772
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,999
we now have a moment in history
where we

773
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,999
can actually incorporate and
advance

774
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,999
those ideas yes so the next
time windows

775
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,999
acts like a bitch just think
Bill Gates

776
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,999
and then you'll know that's why
we

777
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:05,999
worship Him that's why you
can't make it

778
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,999
up you cannot make it up you
can't now

779
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,999
I'll take you into your UK
clips ready

780
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,999
control ready I'm gonna take
you into

781
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,999
your UK clips here's what we're
gonna do

782
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,999
I've got a clip from the UK but
first

783
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,999
some feedback on the stochastic
model

784
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,999
and the assessment thereof of
the Neil

785
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,999
Ferguson Imperial College model
here is

786
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,999
you me Neil Ferguson the guy
who is

787
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,999
shacked up with his mistress
when he was

788
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,999
supposed to be yes sheltered in
place is

789
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,999
the one that's the one the guy
who was

790
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,999
overestimated quite a lot of
numbers

791
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,999
throughout the run see that
that would

792
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,999
be 2 million deaths in United
States we

793
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,999
didn't get too many 500,000 in
the

794
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,999
United Kingdom alone yes that
guy and I

795
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,999
and you recall that he built
these

796
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,999
models not on rock and roll but
on 13

797
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,999
year-old undocumented code and
we had

798
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,999
the lockdown skeptics org and
they

799
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,999
reviewed the code and they had
some

800
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,999
interaction as well with the
college

801
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,999
defeating I had some questions
back and

802
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,999
forth and one of the things

803
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,999
came up was it was the
stochastic part

804
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,999
was and I really didn't have the

805
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,999
capability to analyze it
properly but

806
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,999
what you and I thought was wait
a minute

807
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,999
if this thing is returning
random

808
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,999
results then something's wrong
with it

809
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,999
and we were partially right and
I just

810
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,999
want to read this one paragraph
from

811
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,999
producer Richard who analyzed
what's

812
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,999
going on he says the model and
this is

813
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,999
what the article says under the

814
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,999
paragraph the model and
elsewhere it's a

815
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,999
simulation and of course with
the

816
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,999
simulation you do want some
random

817
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,999
factors being thrown in but he
says this

818
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,999
certainly looks like a poorly
written

819
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,999
one in that in addition to the

820
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,999
intentional pseudo randomness
underlying

821
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,999
the simulation there are
additional

822
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,999
hardware and configuration
dependencies

823
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,999
that cause the results to
differ I would

824
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,999
not call these latter random or

825
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,999
stochastic in the statistical
sense

826
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,999
because despite its flaws

827
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,999
if the code will run multiple
times on

828
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,999
the same Hardware in the same

829
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,999
configuration with fixed random
number

830
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,999
seeds the results would be
identical at

831
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,999
least in single thread mode
this is how

832
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,999
stupid this is

833
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,999
Ferguson's attitude about it is
very

834
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,999
poor and he says admittedly were

835
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,999
partially right about the model
about it

836
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,999
the pseudo randomness of it so
bottom

837
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,999
line this model is shaky it
sounds like

838
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,999
it's it's you know this is this
whole

839
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,999
thing and I don't want to again
I'm not

840
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,999
I'm just sounded like an
ideologue but

841
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,999
this is the same kind of thing
you see

842
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,999
with global warming these
mediocre

843
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,999
models and they go on and on
with these

844
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,999
models and then they make
decisions

845
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,999
based on their lousy output and
that's

846
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,999
what we've have right now with
this

847
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,999
stupid thing and his model in
the

848
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,999
Imperial College whatever that
is not

849
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,999
Oxford it's not it's not
Manchester I

850
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,999
mean what is this place very
influential

851
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,999
that they nearly yeah because
the whole

852
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,999
world's been shut down because
of their

853
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,999
their pride models and this is
what's

854
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,999
going on with global warming to
which

855
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,999
people will never listen to
these people

856
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,999
have never had a science
they've never

857
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,999
taken a course in science but
they're

858
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:20,999
all 

859
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,999
all the big experts and so all
the media

860
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,999
people none of them have ever
they can

861
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,999
barely get through a sociology
class but

862
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,999
here they are talking about
these

863
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,999
computer models and how the
gold is

864
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,999
gonna is melting the world's
melting

865
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,999
it's not just Oliva balandin
snot just

866
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,999
the models it's the actual data
itself

867
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,999
we are hearing numbers of dead
people

868
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,999
ranging from 37,000 to 72,000
we don't

869
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,999
really know what dead is and
the CDC has

870
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,999
a history of exaggerating
numbers of

871
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,999
dead and go back to 2000 from
the movie

872
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,999
super from the documentary
Super Size Me

873
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,999
and at the time there were
headlines

874
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,999
trumpeting everywhere that
obesity was

875
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,999
soon to overtake smoking as the
number

876
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,999
one cause of preventable death
in this

877
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,999
country the head of the CDC
Julie Gerber

878
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,999
Dean went before Congress and
issued big

879
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,999
warnings and there was a big
uproar over

880
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,999
the number of deaths that were
to occur

881
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,999
basically what they did was
divide their

882
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,999
survey samples between people
who are

883
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,999
obese and people who are not
obese and

884
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,999
then basically looked at rates
of death

885
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,999
now if you are obese and you
died from a

886
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,999
snake bite they would say that
it was

887
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,999
your obesity that was causing
your death

888
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,999
not the snake bite and sound
familiar it

889
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,999
was part of a little statistical

890
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,999
hanky-panky on their part in
other news

891
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,999
today the Centers for Disease
Control

892
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,999
said it made a mistake about
the scope

893
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,999
of the obesity epidemic in the
country

894
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,999
roughly a year later another
set of

895
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,999
researchers from the CDC
offered a much

896
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,999
much lower set of estimates
according to

897
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,999
their estimates it was roughly
25

898
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,999
thousand people a year who were
dying

899
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,999
from weighing too much
researchers say

900
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,999
that mathematical errors
exaggerated the

901
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,999
death toll why did the CDC
inflate the

902
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,999
numbers of deaths attributable
to

903
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,999
obesity 

904
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,999
follow the money I think it's
all about

905
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,999
funding and bureaucratic
mission when I

906
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,999
talked to a few CDC officials
they're

907
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,999
constantly preoccupied about
how much

908
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,999
money the government our
Congress is

909
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,999
gonna allow for them for the
next year

910
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,999
they're constantly worried
about getting

911
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,999
their funding cut

912
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,999
all of this might have gone
unnoticed

913
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,999
except for the anti-tobacco
people who

914
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,999
see this as a zero-sum game so
they see

915
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,999
that if obesity becomes a big
public

916
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,999
health issue it's gonna crowd
out

917
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,999
funding to tackle smoking as a
public

918
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,999
health issue so they were among
the

919
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,999
first people to tell him to
point out a

920
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,999
lot of the methodological
problems and

921
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,999
the estimates relating obesity
the

922
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,999
public health outcomes so
they're just a

923
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,999
bunch of lying corrupt
douchebags and

924
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,999
they do it all for the money
for their

925
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,999
own projects for their own
grants

926
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,999
there's so much money in Health
and

927
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,999
Human Services is an incredible

928
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,999
I mean foul cheese little teeny
teeny

929
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,999
weeny division is 11 billion
dollars and

930
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,999
we heard from one of our
producers John

931
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,999
you were on the email who knows
people

932
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,999
in in the business and and they
hate

933
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,999
that within what they call the
flu

934
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,999
people the flu people they get
all the

935
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,999
money it's always the flu
people within

936
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,999
we also point out in that note
that the

937
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,999
flu numbers are probably
exaggerated cuz

938
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,999
we're always talking to all
60,000

939
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,999
60,000 dead from the flu the
seasonal

940
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,999
flu is killing thirty to sixty
thousand

941
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,999
people and it that number may be

942
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,999
exaggerated Allah seemed it
appears that

943
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,999
well RFK jr. is all over this
he says

944
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,999
maybe a thousand people a year
die from

945
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,999
the flu he says it's a lie it's
just a

946
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,999
lie he says but it's a big
moneymaker

947
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,999
for the that by the way it was
the first

948
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,999
question Adam tell me about
yourself

949
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,999
you're 55 okay when's the last
time you

950
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,999
had your flu shot first
question out of

951
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,999
the gate and I say never and he
went

952
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,999
okay next question actually
that's funny

953
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,999
because I've had a big question
asked me

954
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,999
and and as soon as you say I am
I gonna

955
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,999
get one

956
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,999
they don't even lecture you
about it I

957
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,999
mean so I mean it's as though
they asked

958
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,999
this question gratuitously no
because if

959
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,999
they were serious about when
they say

960
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,999
well you should get one no no
no all

961
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,999
they have to do is put the black

962
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,999
checkmark in the database
that's what I

963
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,999
mean by gratuitous they're just
doing it

964
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,999
for someone's black check mark
so

965
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,999
they've done their job yes and
there and

966
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,999
the follow-up it's exact same
by the way

967
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,999
no offense of the doctors out
there but

968
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,999
how is that any different than
would you

969
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:37,999
like fries with that what sighs
mm-hmm

970
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,999
because it's not as though the
french

971
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,999
fry guy had McDonald's or
wherever it is

972
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,999
pushes it they don't say we
should like

973
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,999
fries or they say no they said
all you

974
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,999
should they're great no but for
now it's

975
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,999
not entirely true because the
then it

976
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,999
would be McDonald's saying
excuse me sir

977
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,999
when's the last time you had
fries time

978
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,999
for a tasty fry aren't you
hungry all

979
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,999
right 

980
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,999
so clearly the CDC has had
issues in the

981
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,999
past and there's so much
confusion we

982
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,999
cannot trust any of this data
so who

983
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,999
knows it could be a thousand
people

984
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,999
could be a hundred thousand
people we

985
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,999
don't know we don't know
there's some

986
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,999
average but it seems to be a
heck of a

987
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,999
lot less than we were scared
into

988
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,999
staying home for now did this
work and

989
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,999
you too and I put that chart in
the in

990
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,999
the show notes of the guy who
took the

991
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,999
data before the lockdown after
the

992
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,999
lockdown looked at all the
death rates

993
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,999
of all 50 states and charted
them and it

994
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,999
shows statistically if I
understand it

995
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,999
and I'm not a statistician that
there's

996
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,999
pretty much no difference
between in the

997
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,999
death rate between staying home
or not

998
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,999
staying home you saw this graph
right

999
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,999
yes this graph has been going
around it

1000
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,999
was all over Twitter and it
indicated

1001
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,999
that based on the early numbers
and if

1002
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,999
he's projected outward the
states that

1003
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,999
said we're not locking down and
the

1004
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,999
states is's were locking down
there was

1005
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,999
the graph goes exactly as it
would if

1006
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,999
they if they even switched
positions you

1007
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,999
know the DES block down didn't
do

1008
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,999
anything in other words and
meanwhile

1009
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,999
we're still locked down and
worried sick

1010
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,999
because we have again a lot of
Democrat

1011
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,999
governors and who are scared
that if

1012
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,999
they lift a lockdown oh my god
I'm gonna

1013
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,999
be blamed for somebody else yes
yes

1014
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,999
point the finger at me it's
gonna be

1015
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,999
blood on my hands but even
crazier is if

1016
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,999
you look at New York and the
numbers

1017
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,999
appear to show that over 60% of
the

1018
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,999
people infected got infected
while they

1019
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:38,999
were 

1020
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,999
home lockdown but that doesn't
sit well

1021
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,999
with the media oh no no no no
no that

1022
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,999
can't be true well we certainly
hope so

1023
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,999
I want to put up a quote from
Governor

1024
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,999
Cuomo in New York which which
sort of

1025
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,999
had some surprising information
in it he

1026
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,999
said 66% of the people who were
new

1027
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,999
cases were at home which is
shocking to

1028
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,999
us he said this is a surprise

1029
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,999
overwhelmingly the people were
at home

1030
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,999
we thought maybe they were
taking public

1031
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,999
transportation and we've taken
special

1032
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,999
precautions but actually no
these people

1033
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,999
were literally at home 66% of
the new

1034
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,999
cases how does that happen well

1035
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,999
generally speaking patients
report and

1036
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,999
this has been well established
better

1037
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,999
and safer behaviors than reality

1038
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,999
so people report that they may
be

1039
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,999
staying at home they're lying
but in

1040
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,999
fact we know 600 people got the

1041
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,999
infection during pretty harsh
sheltering

1042
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,999
conditions in the New York area

1043
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,999
how did that happen that means
they got

1044
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,999
the infection during the extreme

1045
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,999
measures dude this they can't
even take

1046
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,999
any kind of news in any other
light can

1047
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,999
they these people be dead liars

Katie

1052
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,999
Hopkins on Sky luckily at least
they can

1053
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,999
talk about the Neil Ferguson
guy and his

1054
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,999
multiple mistakes and only in
typical

1055
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,999
British fashion can they rip a
guy down

1056
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,999
the way Katie Hopkins does in
this clip

1057
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,999
unbelievable so there's this
bearded

1058
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,999
scientist he's the typical
science type

1059
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,999
he looks like the sort of guy
nobody

1060
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,999
would want to sit next to at a
wedding

1061
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,999
he would Neil Ferguson and he's

1062
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,999
basically the guy that was the
the he

1063
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,999
was the one that made it such
that the

1064
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,999
UK was locked down he's called
professor

1065
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,999
lockdown he was the one that
came up

1066
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,999
with the modelling that
persuaded Boris

1067
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,999
Johnson that we all had to be
shut away

1068
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,999
and put under house arrest in
our homes

1069
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,999
he says 500,000 people might
die in the

1070
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,999
UK because of coronavirus now
what they

1071
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:52,999
then 

1072
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,999
did whilst he had the rest of
us locked

1073
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,999
down he got his mistress his
married

1074
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,999
lover a woman funnily enough
called

1075
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,999
missus stats so for a guy who
does

1076
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,999
modelling and statistics she's
called

1077
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,999
back he had her over and
professor pants

1078
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,999
down got his pecker out on a
number of

1079
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,999
occasions to you know help
entertain

1080
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,999
mrs. stats whilst the rest of
us were

1081
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,999
locked out so number one massive

1082
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,999
hypocrisy as per usual number
two he is

1083
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,999
known for being absolutely
crazy with

1084
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,999
these models like five hundred
thousand

1085
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,999
deaths we're nowhere near that
number he

1086
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,999
predicted 200 million would die
from the

1087
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,999
bird flu I believe it ended up
in two

1088
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,999
hundred and forty two like his
modeling

1089
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,999
is about as accurate as my
five-year-old

1090
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,999
standing up to take a pee so
why were

1091
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,999
listening to him at all I don't
know and

1092
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,999
now professor pants down as god
is

1093
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,999
torture out whilst the rest of
us are in

1094
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,999
lockdown so frankly regular
Brits that

1095
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,999
had enough whoa you got butt
slam in

1096
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,999
that clip really because we
played a

1097
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,999
Katie Hopkins clips two shows
ago where

1098
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,999
she's bitching about the same
guy but

1099
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,999
before the mistress story and
she used

1100
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,999
the same story about her little
boy

1101
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,999
trying to pee standing up oh I
forgot

1102
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,999
about recycling some of her gag

1103
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,999
oh boo boo hoo well we shall
report that

1104
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,999
to the sky news division these
fake news

1105
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,999
is it's old news this is no
good we

1106
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,999
can't have that alright so here
I here

1107
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,999
we are in the UK welcome it's
your turn

1108
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,999
ok well I don't have anything
to compare

1109
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:36,999
to that last clip you pre
topped me very

1110
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,999
funny UK restrictions garden
centres

1111
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,999
they finally get their openers
loosen

1112
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,999
things up by opening up the
garden

1113
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,999
centers of any major loosening
of

1114
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,999
restrictions garden centers
though in

1115
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,999
England will be allowed to open
from

1116
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,999
Wednesday it's part of first
step

1117
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,999
measures but with the Sun out
this

1118
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,999
weekend many people are already
ignoring

1119
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,999
some of the restrictions still
in place

1120
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,999
as Rebecca Williams reports

1121
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,999
the sun's out and you'd be
forgiven for

1122
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,999
thinking lockdown is over
despite the

1123
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,999
odd reminder mixed messages and
little

1124
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,999
information from the government
to

1125
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,999
making it feel like the country
starting

1126
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,999
to move again definitely needs
to be

1127
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,999
lifted two roundabouts now like
a lot of

1128
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,999
the people they're not really
sticking

1129
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,999
to the rules anyway I think he
should go

1130
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,999
as far as he can to reduce it

1131
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,999
I think people be very good so
far I

1132
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,999
think there's a tipping point
you feel a

1133
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,999
bit weird like it's
contradicting the

1134
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,999
feeling of are we allowed to be
outside

1135
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,999
now I realized to do more than
one

1136
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,999
exercise a day I think is going
to be

1137
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,999
definitely easy because it's
already

1138
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,999
happening so it would be very
strange if

1139
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,999
he says the opposite doing the
lockdown

1140
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,999
most have stuck to the rules
but police

1141
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,999
have had to come down hard on
some in

1142
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,999
the West Midlands this man even
spat

1143
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,999
blood into a police officers
eye as he

1144
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,999
was handcuffed raising fears of

1145
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,999
contamination forces across the
UK have

1146
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,999
been patrolling parks and
streets but

1147
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,999
there are concerns that this
weekend

1148
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,999
could place added pressure on
officers

1149
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,999
it's got its challenges because
it's a

1150
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,999
bank holiday weekend people
people need

1151
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,999
a boost I think and it's a great

1152
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,999
opportunity to commemorate the
VE Day

1153
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,999
celebrations I knew it's
confusing but

1154
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,999
the rules are still the same

1155
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,999
so the week's go on it seems
parts of

1156
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,999
the country are getting busier
and

1157
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,999
busier in the first four weeks
have

1158
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,999
locked down the police issued
nearly

1159
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,999
nine thousand fixed penalty
notices to

1160
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,999
those flouting the rules for
the highest

1161
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,999
number issued in London the
tenth Valley

1162
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,999
and also Lancashire fine there
is that

1163
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,999
they're handing out tickets
yeah hundred

1164
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,999
pounds I think and our friend
in the UK

1165
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,999
the NHS worker she says the
real problem

1166
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,999
that she's noticing is the what
they

1167
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,999
call them to British isn't like

00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,999
percent since lockdown started
and ad

1220
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,999
revenue down between 50 and 80
percents

1221
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,999
do you have and it's the local
papers

1222
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,999
that are really suffering we
all want

1223
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,999
local newspapers they're really

1224
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,999
important for communities and
providing

1225
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,999
local news and giving guidance
to people

1226
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,999
if they start to disappear as
some

1227
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,999
already have I think that's a
real

1228
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,999
problem 

1229
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,999
one solution being tabled is to

1230
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,999
legislate to force the tech
giants to

1231
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,999
pay for news they've never
really

1232
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,999
compensated news organizations
properly

1233
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,999
for the value of their content
shared

1234
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,999
through those services and
that's

1235
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,999
accelerated their decline and
if we do

1236
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,999
nothing now in a very short
period of

1237
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,999
time we're going to see more
news

1238
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,999
organizations go out of business

1239
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,999
and more people increasingly
reliant on

1240
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,999
the sorts of disinformation and

1241
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,999
low-quality news that
circulates like a

1242
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,999
virus through social media and
with

1243
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,999
digital users continuing to
rise the

1244
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,999
physical paper could ultimately
be saved

1245
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,999
by online success stories these
persons

1246
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,999
can use hold on a second hold
on a

1247
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,999
second how does this work how
come those

1248
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,999
how come those guys are all mad
at

1249
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,999
Google issued in Google be
giving them

1250
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:25,999
their journalists like they do
in

1251
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,999
America we just talk about the
line that

1252
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,999
there's did once the newspapers
go the

1253
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,999
only thing is gonna be
low-quality

1254
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,999
crappy news and then I'm
thinking to

1255
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,999

kind of the

1306
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,999
story which was starting to

00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,999
Thursday and now it's getting
more

1308
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,999
traction is this bright yeah

1309
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,999
this is the guy who will be the

1310
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,999

got ik

1313
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,999

00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,999
short clips but this Norah
O'Donnell is

they're the best clips so this
guy who

1320
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,999
is a nudnik to say the least

1321
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,999
and I don't want to defame him
because

1322
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,999
of your

1323
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,999

kind of a

1327
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,999
character that and he's over
he's okay

1328
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,999

01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,999
go that's fine and so he comes
on is it

1330
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,999

be the Democrats new oh he's
gonna be

1332
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,999
the strong man that's gonna
take down

1333
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,999
Trump and this guy can barely
keep it

1334
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,999
together talking to Nora so
let's listen

1335
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,999
to the clip this is nor on the
hook no

1336
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:22,999
it's actually only three so
let's go at

1337
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,999
Nora interviews bright does the
intro

1338
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,999
quite recently led Barta that's
a key

1339
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,999
agency created to defend the
country

1340
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,999
against troops and he says he
was

1341
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,999
removed from his job for
putting science

1342
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,999
over politics and he filed a

1343
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,999
whistleblower complaint earlier
this

1344
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,999
week and today a federal agency
found

1345
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,999
reasonable grounds to believe
that the

1346
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,999
administrative administration
was

1347
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,999
retaliating against bright well
tonight

1348
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,999
a preview of our wide-ranging

1349
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:52,999
conversation buzzing so this
guy you

1350
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,999
know this agency nobody's ever
heard of

1351
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,999
is making a big fuss and they
they're

1352
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:57,999
gonna use they're gonna grow
after

1353
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,999
another impeachment with this
character

1354
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,999
but I think he's weak listen to
him he

1355
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,999
can't even keep it together in
this

1356
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,999
twenty two second clip part no
no to

1357
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,999
make it part noise from size 50
seconds

1358
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,999
part two tonight another no
wait hold on

1359
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,999
we had interviews bright too

1360
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,999
okay but we skipped over nor it
uh-huh

1361
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,999
I'm sorry I had the wrong one
okay here

1362
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,999
we go the president called you a

1363
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,999
disgruntled employee I am NOT

1364
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,999
disgruntled I am frustrated at
a lack of

1365
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,999
leadership I am frustrated and
a lack of

1366
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,999
urgency to get a head start on

1367
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,999
developing life-saving tools for

1368
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,999
Americans I'm frustrated at our

1369
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,999
inability to be heard as
scientists

1370
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,999
those things frustrate me as
early as

1371
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,999
January email show he was
sounding the

1372
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,999
alarm first about the critical
shortage

1373
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,999
of n95 masks we see

1374
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,999
to many doctors and nurses now
dying and

1375
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,999
I was thinking that we could
have done

1376
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,999
more to get this mask and their
supplies

1377
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,999
to them sooner and if we had
would they

1378
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,999
still be alive today this is
the beauty

1379
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,999
oh yeah

1380
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:29,999
Trump has blood on his hands he
saw all

1381
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,999
the talking points at Nancy's
he sounds

1382
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:40,999
familiar he sounds like this
guy either

1383
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,999
work for someone else are you
work for

1384
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,999
yourself and most people work
for

1385
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,999
someone else in a way that they
aren't

1386
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:53,999
free noodle boy only talks even
slower

1387
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,999
dumb noodle boy its noodle boy
2.0 yeah

he's

1390
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,999
like you see but it this is so
pathetic

1391
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,999
anyway this part three that's a
horrible

1392
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,999
thought to think about the time
that

1393
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,999
passed where we could have done

1394
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:14,999
something 

1395
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,999
and we didn't bright claims his

1396
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,999
persistent warnings caused
tension with

1397
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:20,999
his bosses at the Department of
Health

1398
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,999
and Human Services it reached a
breaking

1399
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,999
point when he raised concerns
over the

1400
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:26,999
administration's embrace of

1401
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,999
hydroxychloroquine what he
called a drug

1402
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,999
unproven to treat kovat 19
patients you

1403
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,999
believe you were retaliated
against

1404
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,999
because you raised concerns
about

1405
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,999
hydroxychloroquine yes I did
and says he

1406
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,999
was surprised to learn he'd been

1407
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,999
reassigned to the NIH to develop

1408
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,999
diagnostic testing you'd been
sounding

1409
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:51,999
the alarm about the lack of
testing

1410
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,999
platforms this sounded like an
important

1411
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,999
job that's an important
initiative nor

1412
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,999
I'm the director of Barda to
take me out

1413
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,999
of our organization focus on
drugs and

1414
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,999
vaccines and diagnostics in the
middle

1415
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,999
of a pandemic the worst public
health

1416
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,999
crisis that our country is
faced in a

1417
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:13,999
sense 

1418
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,999
three and decapitate the Barda

1419
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,999
organization to move me over to
a very

1420
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,999
small focused project of any
scale of

1421
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,999
any level importance it's not

1422
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,999
responsible didn't make sense

1423
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,999
oh my god drama queen is the
right

1424
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,999
question or is the right
description oh

01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,999
my goodness so what is this
Barda

1426
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,999
organization if someone is just

subgroup who runs on HHS and
it's

1428
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,999
biomedical Advanced Research

Advanced Research and
Development

1430
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,999
Authority oh yeah without those

Barda with addy that's where it
is Barda

1433
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,999

website

1434
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,999
- yeah this guy's this guy's
gonna be

1435
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,999
their their go-to guy and
they're gonna

1436
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,999
do if you will see them and
listen to

1437
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,999
them the Republicans on those
committees

1438
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,999
even though they're just gonna
be housed

1439
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,999
you know so it's gonna be led
by Nadler

1440
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,999
and shit the Republicans that
are on

1441
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,999
those committees will eat this
guy alive

1442
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,999
he's gonna be a wreck Wow yeah
I don't

1443
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,999
know how well he'll do without
going

1444
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,999
into tears this is this is
portly died

1445
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,999
but this is part of a larger
movement

1446
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,999
that the media is involved in

1447
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,999
Entertainment News Hollywood I
have two

1448
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:46,999
clips to back it up unless you
want to

1449
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,999
do more but this could but
about this

1450
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,999
particular topic there's blood
on his

1451
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,999
hands this shows up

1452
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,999
this is WGN TV Chicago

1453
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,999
a new study says the death toll
in the

1454
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,999
u.s. is double what it could
have been

1455
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,999
if governments had responded
just a few

1456
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,999
days earlier the earliest
stay-at-home

1457
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,999
orders were implemented in late
March

1458
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,999
orders to wear face masks began
in April

1459
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,999
researchers with Princeton say
if these

1460
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,999
orders had come four days
earlier the US

1461
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,999
would be seeing fewer than a
thousand

1462
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,999
deaths a day instead of more
than 2,000

1463
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,999
a day they point to California
which

1464
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,999
implemented stay-at-home orders
early

1465
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,999
and now has fewer deaths per
capita than

1466
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,999
other large states see how that
works

1467
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,999
that's exactly how it works so
but that

1468
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,999
hasn't taken it far enough no
for that

1469
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,999
we need to go to Hollywood and
for that

1470
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,999
we need to check in with your
girl Amy

1471
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,999
on Democracy Now 56 foot
billboard

1472
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,999
called the Trump Dethklok has
been

1473
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,999
unveiled in Times Square here
in New

1474
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,999
York the Billboard was created
by the

1475
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,999
oscar-nominated filmmaker
Eugene Jarecki

1476
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,999
so the drunk Dethklok is a
billboard

1477
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,999
that hangs over Times Square by
the way

1478
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,999
this is the same will yo as as
this is

1479
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,999
Brent guy and what it shows is
an

1480
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,999
estimate of the number of u.s.
kovat 19

1481
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,999
deaths that resulted from the
president

1482
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,999
and his team's failed response
to the

1483
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,999
corona virus outbreak thanks to
doctor

1484
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,999
foul Chi and leading
epidemiologists we

1485
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,999
now know that had the mitigation

1486
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,999
guidelines been put into effect
just one

1487
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,999
week earlier on March 9th

1488
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,999
instead of March 16th 60% of
u.s. kovat

1489
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:27,999
19 deaths would have been
prevented

1490
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,999
that's an incredible number and
on

1491
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,999
behalf of all those who live
needlessly

1492
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,999
lost their lives to this failed

1493
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,999
leadership in a pandemic we
need a

1494
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,999
symbol a symbol that cries out
not only

1495
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,999
for accountability but also for
more

1496
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,999
responsible and responsive
stewardship

1497
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,999
going forward at the time of
this

1498
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,999
broadcast the Trump Dethklok
stands at

1499
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,999
46,000 485 and growing the
arrogance of

1500
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,999
this hole right down to Amy's
report and

1501
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,999
growing I am actually
speechless it is

1502
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,999
and of course this is the
bottom of the

1503
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,999
days like sleaze ball tactic it
is and

1504
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:10,999
Eugene 

1505
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,999
Jarecki who is a respected film
director

1506
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,999
you know kind of more like a
Sundance

1507
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,999
kind of guy but he has a brand
new movie

1508
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,999
coming out on Netflix who have
quite a

1509
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,999
China strategy so maybe that has

1510
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:26,999
something to do with it

1511
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,999
I don't know how you get a
billboard on

1512
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,999
Times Square will I do actually
I don't

1513
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,999
know if you can even get one
now if

1514
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,999
there's business is being done
but I

1515
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,999
don't I know who owns Time
Square so

1516
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,999
this is a Chinese thing going
on with

1517
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,999
this guy as far as I'm
concerned he's

1518
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,999
virtue signaling towards his
money

1519
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,999
people and his backers and
whatever else

1520
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,999
it's sickening and then for Amy
this

1521
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,999
pencast the Dethklok 46,000 321
and

1522
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,999
Counting lady horrible horrible
horrible

1523
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,999
that is the that is yes that
Dethklok

1524
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,999
thing is it's a humiliation to
the

1525
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,999
country but speaking of
humiliation and

1526
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,999
it's China China oh yeah

1527
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,999
China's put the Dethklok up
there

1528
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:17,999
because they hate Trump they
may be

1529
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,999
behind this whole thing for all
we know

1530
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,999
they can't nobody's been able
to prove

1531
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,999
it and now they're doing this
bullcrap

1532
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,999
just to get Trump out something
like Joe

1533
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,999
Biden well let's have a little
listen to

1534
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,999
the president from the Oval
Office I

1535
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,999
think the words matter you know
what you

1536
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,999
the worst attack we've ever had
on our

1537
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,999
country this is really the
worst attack

1538
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,999
we've ever had this is worse
than Pearl

1539
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,999
Harbor this is worse than the
World

1540
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,999
Trade Center there's never been
an

1541
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,999
attack like this and it should
have

1542
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:50,999
never happened

1543
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,999
could have been stopped at the
source

1544
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,999
that seems if I were in Beijing
I'd be

1545
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,999
like what did he what did he
call an

1546
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,999
attack an attack that's very
clear

1547
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,999
language to me I don't know if
they're

1548
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,999
gonna keep pulling this stuff
like the

1549
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,999
Dethklok the china and yeah we
will say

1550
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,999
that the chinese are behind it
that

1551
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:10,999
because i think your analysis
is correct

1552
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,999
they're gonna hear more of that
because

1553
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,999
you know they we call it the
Chinese flu

1554
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,999
and all this and he backed off
almost

1555
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:18,999
overnight because of a phone
call or

1556
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,999
whatever because he does these
you know

1557
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,999
he does ago she eights well he's

1558
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,999
negotiating now no he went the
Chinese

1559
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,999
want to keep just keep the
pressure up

1560
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,999
to get him voted out which is

masks on wheeling boxes of PP
ease into

1571
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,999
a health care center and doing
his best

1572
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,999
to lift them what a hero it
just barely

1573
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,999
in the door and since it was
going so

1574
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,999
well and also because he didn't
realize

1575
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,999
he had a mic on Magic Mike
decided to

1576
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:24,999
keep it going listening closely
here

1577
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,999
you probably can't hear it but
pence

1578
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,999
literally says to how about
these boxes

1579
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,999
the guy says those are empty
sir and he

1580
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:32,999
says well why don't we just
grab what

1581
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,999
for the for the TV cameras Mike
Pence

1582
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,999
pretending to carry empty boxes
of pee

1583
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,999
pees into a hospital is the
perfect

1584
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,999
metaphor for who he is and what
he's

1585
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,999
doing a big box of nothing
delivering

1586
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,999
another box of nothing so when
I saw the

1587
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,999
clip I'm like oh my god how can
you how

1588
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,999
can you fail on that that's so
so lame

1589
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,999
and I was looking at it on
Twitter and

1590
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,999
I'm gonna give Twitter props
it's right

1591
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,999
underneath the video it said
manipulated

1592
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,999
media I'm like that's
interesting I

1593
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,999
click on it then it says
according to

1594
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,999
some people this was edited
it's not the

1595
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,999
way it happened well it is the
way it

1596
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,999
happened because there's this
is on

1597
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,999
c-span I put a link to it in
the show

1598
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,999
notes there's 20 minutes of
pense

1599
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,999
literally lugging boxes diving
into the

1600
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:21,999
back of the van

1601
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,999
slapping him out not letting
other

1602
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,999
people really help him and
they're heavy

1603
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,999
he's putting them all down at
the very

1604
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,999
end they're joking around and
the guy

1605
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,999
says now those are empty so
come on

1606
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,999
we'll just do it for the TV
cameras

1607
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,999
after he's actually done that

1608
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,999
yeah well Kimmel apologized
because he

1609
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,999
did oh I didn't know I
apologize so but

1610
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,999
he apologized in an offhanded
way the

1611
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,999
apology consisted of him saying
well it

1612
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,999
would turn out that the boxes
he was

1613
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,999
carrying were full they weren't
empty at

1614
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,999
all and I'm so sorry that we
made this

1615
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,999
we this was wrong from and I
hate to say

1616
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,999
that because of it for the

1617
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,999
administration was lying all
the time

1618
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,999
johnny has to because he's got
the

1619
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,999
Chinese Communist Party up his
little

1620
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,999
mouse but like hey hey hey you
be

1621
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,999
careful there but here's what's
really

1622
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,999
going on Reuters subs fara nod
know is

1623
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,999
really the first one to report
on it

1624
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,999
because I think at all it also
is going

1625
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,999
to have a name pretty soon the
name

1626
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,999
would be the economic
prosperity Network

1627
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,999
sharpening his tone against
China

1628
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:37,999
President 

1629
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,999
Trump said late Thursday a
trade deal

1630
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,999
between the two was now of
secondary

1631
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,999
importance the u.s. leader
threatened

1632
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,999
Beijing with new tariffs as his

1633
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:47,999
administration crafted
retaliatory

1634
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,999
measures over COBIT 19 Trump's

1635
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,999
frustration has been growing as
tens of

1636
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:54,999
thousands have died from the
virus in

1637
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,999
the u.s. the economic
contraction as a

1638
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,999
result also threatens his
chances of

1639
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,999
re-election in November two US
officials

1640
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,999
speaking on condition of
anonymity said

1641
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,999
a range of options against
China were in

1642
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,999
the early stages of discussion
although

1643
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,999
they added that recommendations
have not

1644
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:13,999
yet reached the level of trumps
top

1645
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,999
national security team or the
president

1646
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,999
one source said there's a
discussion as

1647
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,999
to how hard to hit China that
could

1648
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,999
leave the u.s. walking a
tightrope in

1649
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,999
its ties with Beijing it's
currently

1650
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,999
importing crucial personal
protection

1651
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,999
equipment from China for health
care

1652
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,999
workers a multi-billion dollar
first

1653
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,999
phase trade deal with China was
only

1654
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,999
signed in January world stocks
pulled

1655
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,999
back further on Friday
following Trump's

1656
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,999
comments while most European
markets

1657
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,999
were closed for a public
holiday stocks

1658
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,999
in London slid over two percent
grim

1659
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,999
data combined with Trump's
threats added

1660
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,999
to already dented sentiment so
this

1661
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,999
thing is real it's quite a task
force in

1662
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,999
fact the the information coming
out is

1663
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,999
this is a whole-of-government
effort the

1664
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,999
very well-known phrase of
course but in

1665
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,999
Trump's case it might actually
happen in

1666
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,999
which free trade advocates seem
to be

1667
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,999
losing their struggle with the
China

1668
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,999
Hawks inside the administration
yes it

1669
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,999
seems like the globalist are
losing out

1670
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,999
this time and I was listening
to a

1671
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,999
globalist who I happen to like
where is

1672
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,999
my globalist buddy here

1673
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,999
this is Elon Musk Oh a LAN and
he was on

1674
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,999
Joe Rogan which was a
interesting I

1675
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,999
think Joe does some of his best
work

1676
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,999
with with Elon Musk that that's
a very

1677
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,999
messed up interview to listen
to at

1678
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,999
times well this was I found
this one in

1679
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,999
pod musk seemed something was
like

1680
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,999
something was wrong with him
well I

1681
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,999
think he's still trying to
figure out

1682
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,999
how to pronounce his kids own
name you

1683
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,999
know that's that's his problem
there

1684
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:58,999
it's like a ex5 Sigma Tau fine
by me

1685
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,999
Elon but here's what he was
talking

1686
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,999
about when when because he's
been pretty

1687
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,999
vocal about the shutdown and
appears

1688
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,999
he's against that it appears he
thinks

1689
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,999
it's not a good idea and this
came up in

1690
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,999
the interview I mean you look at

1691
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,999
civilization through the ages
most of

1692
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,999
them you know they rose and
fell yeah

1693
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,999
and I do think like the
globalization

1694
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,999
that we have at these sort of
like the

1695
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,999
the mean sphere is there's
there's not

1696
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,999
enough isolation between
countries or

1697
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,999
regions it's like if you get up
if

1698
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,999
there's a mind virus that that
mind

1699
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,999
virus can infect to much of the
world

1700
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,999
you know I'm like I actually
sort of

1701
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,999
sympathize with the
anti-globalization

1702
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,999
people because it's like man we
don't

1703
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:49,999
ever want to everywhere it'll
be the

1704
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,999
same for sure and then we we
need some

1705
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,999
kind of like mind viral
immunity so

1706
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,999
that's his he's feel some
sympathy with

1707
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:07,999
the anti-globalist people Wow
you're on

1708
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,999
that was the worst the whole
interview

1709
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,999
he just seemed it did it was
just

1710
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,999
disconnected well even
listening to that

1711
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,999
clip it's like what was he
given I don't

1712
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:20,999
know it's well I think what he
was

1713
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,999
trying to say is that this mind
virus

1714
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,999
where everyone's like holy crap
we're

1715
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,999
all gonna die I mean it's not
just like

1716
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,999
something that happened
accidentally it

1717
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,999
came from somewhere and has been

1718
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,999
enhanced a gain-of-function
amplified by

1719
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,999
the mainstream media

1720
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,999
and he says no HUD how do we
how do we

1721
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,999
stop that well that's basically
what

1722
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,999
globalism does and what it
wants but

1723
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,999
well I agree with with you your
you

1724
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,999
should have been on the show
back on the

1725
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,999
show yes I have not been
invited well

1726
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,999
you will be that's going to be
a couple

1727
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,999
other things going on we can
take a

1728
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,999
couple of cases in the white
house yes

1729
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:01,999
this is Mayo

1730
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,999
and so this is to try to play
that Norah

1731
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,999
on new cases this is a big deal
tonight

1732
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,999
another White House staffer
this time a

1733
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,999
top aide to the vice president
has

1734
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,999
tested positive for coronavirus
Katie

1735
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:15,999
Miller the press secretary to
vice

1736
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,999
president pence is now the
second

1737
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,999
confirmed case tied to the West
Wing

1738
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,999
after a valet who serves the
president's

1739
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,999
meals tested positive on
Wednesday

1740
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,999
Miller is married to Stephen
Miller one

1741
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,999
of the president's senior
advisors and

1742
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,999
tonight her test is raising
questions

1743
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:31,999
about whether the White House
is doing

1744
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,999
enough to distance the
president and

1745
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,999
vice president from others for
his part

1746
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,999
president Trump told reporters
today the

1747
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,999
whole concept of tests aren't
great

1748
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,999
those are his words and he said
he's

1749
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:43,999
convinced the virus will just
go away

1750
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,999
without a vaccine his own
advisors have

1751
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:55,999
said that's not true this is
gonna go

1752
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,999
away by itself which seems to
be the

1753
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,999
case with all these previous
events you

1754
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,999
know from bird flu to swine
everywhere

1755
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,999
yeah my point people say well
why would

1756
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:06,999
it go away it's gonna come back
I said

1757
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,999
what about SARS how come that
didn't

1758
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:08,999
come back

1759
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,999
SARS we never got an immunity
to SARS so

1760
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,999
we've got MERS yeah we never got

1761
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,999
immunity tumor and then he's
just

1762
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:16,999
throwing and how about peak oil
just

1763
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:25,999
throw that in for no reason so
so Nora

1764
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,999
says at the end that he
president says

1765
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,999
he's gonna be it's gonna go
away and but

1766
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,999
his advisors say it's not yeah
how do

1767
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,999
they know doesn't matter

1768
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,999
no it's not gonna go away what
why does

1769
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,999
his advisors know more than he
does cuz

1770
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,999
it's it's a crapshoot you don't
know

1771
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,999
it's gonna go away or it's not
gonna go

1772
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,999
away there's no proof one way
or the

1773
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,999
other 

1774
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,999
but she wants Trump to go away
so that's

1775
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,999
why she has to report this oh
you're

1776
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,999
talking now just alright did
this go to

1777
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,999
new cases and white houses a
continue to

1778
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,999
report oh but wait there's more
news

1779
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,999

president's closest

01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,999

01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,999

Force two but six staffers who
had

1784
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,999
recent exposure to her had to
be removed

1785
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,999
Katie she tested very good for
a long

1786
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:22,999
period of time and then all of
a sudden

1787
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,999
today she tested positive
doesn't matter

1788
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,999
what you do with Trump you're
the top

1789
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,999
you're the best tested me
better than

1790
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,999
anybody else for negative she
was just

1791
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:34,999
the best negative I mean when
it comes

1792
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,999
to testing Katie you couldn't
have a

1793
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,999
better one you tell me you
could not

1794
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,999
have a better person to be
tested it was

1795
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:41,999
Katie a long period of time and
then all

1796
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,999
of a sudden today she tested
positive

1797
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,999
she hasn't come into contact
with me

1798
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,999
spend some time with the vice
president

1799
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,999
Miller is with the vice
president nearly

1800
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,999
every day her husband is senior

1801
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,999
presidential aide Stephen Miller

1802
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,999
president Trump attended their
wedding

1803
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,999
in February held at Trump's
Washington

1804
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,999
hotel despite the potential
which by the

1805
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,999
way is a great hotel it's one
of the

1806
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,999
best hotels it truly if you
want to test

1807
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:07,999
you want the number one test
you're

1808
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,999
gonna do it the best hotel
that's where

1809
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,999
that's a we don't mess around
Trump even

1810
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,999
put it in the story to bring it
up

1811
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,999
despite the potential exposure
mr. pence

1812
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,999
did not wear a mask while in
Iowa we

1813
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,999
also know that President Trump
was in

1814
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,999
the same room as his personal
White

1815
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,999
House fillet on Tuesday before
the valet

1816
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,999
tested positive for coronavirus
today

1817
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,999
the president still addressed a
group of

1818
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,999
world war ii veterans at a VE
Day

1819
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,999
ceremony without wearing a mask
the wind

1820
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,999
was blowing so hard in such a
direction

1821
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,999
that if if the plague ever
reached them

1822
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,999
might be very surprised the
president

1823
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,999
says he's now being tested
every day and

1824
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,999
so far as negative but doctors
say that

1825
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,999
may be a false sense of security

1826
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,999
somebody could become infected
be

1827
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:53,999
incubating the virus and test
negative

1828
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,999
every day including yesterday
then this

1829
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,999
morning become infectious still
feel

1830
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,999
fine and spread it to other
people

1831
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,999
before the next

1832
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,999
shows that they are in fact
infected

1833
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,999
that bastard

1834
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,999
I'm glad that that report at
least

1835
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,999
contained 

1836
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,999
a little bit of VE Day which was

1837
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,999
completely ignored by the
American media

1838
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:15,999
I believe you pointed that out
in the

1839
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:16,999
newsletter 

1840
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,999
but it was also very odd to see
you know

1841
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,999
in the in the Netherlands which
was

1842
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,999
liberated on on May 5th but a
May 4th

1843
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,999
they have at 8 o'clock this is
actually

1844
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,999
very unique to the Netherlands
8 p.m. on

1845
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,999
May 4th all traffic stops
everyone is

1846
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,999
quiet and they told the Bell
with ever

1847
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,999
they have a moment of silence
two

1848
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,999
minutes two minutes and
everyone is

1849
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,999
completely silent and it and
I've been

1850
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,999
in the Netherlands where it was
8

1851
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,999
o'clock and the highway people
stopped

1852
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,999
just stopped on the highway and
then

1853
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,999
waited some got out and then
everyone

1854
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:53,999
waited for the two minutes of
silence

1855
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,999
and they got in there drove off
so the

1856
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,999
this ceremony has been going on
since

1857
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,999
the end of World War two and
having the

1858
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,999
the troops the Yanks and the
Brits you

1859
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,999
know coming through and their
jeeps it

1860
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,999
was you know the flags it was
such a

1861
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,999
joyous occasion none of it all
just

1862
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,999
quiet no one on the street if
there no

1863
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,999
no parties I mean this is this
passed by

1864
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,999
that I think it's a shame how
quietly

1865
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,999
that passed by because of all
this I

1866
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,999
don't think it's because of all
this I

1867
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,999
think it was in spite of all
this they

1868
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:30,999
could have done anything they
could have

1869
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,999
made a little presentation on
the news

1870
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,999
or anything instead of all this
just

1871
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,999
nonsense of doing about how
Miller was

1872
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,999
married at the Trump Hotel
there was

1873
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,999
very little mention of it by I
mean

1874
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,999
Trump did this little ceremony
but the

1875
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,999
media just dropped the day
doesn't want

1876
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:49,999
to talk anything about anything
that's

1877
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,999
patriotic well no I don't want
to do it

1878
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,999
they'd rather do it that made
rather

1879
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,999
brag about the big sign talking
about

1880
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,999
how many dead or some Trump the
other

1881
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,999
thing is again a Chinese
influence the

1882
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,999
Chinese do not want the
Americas the

1883
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,999
Chinese by the way I've been
watching CG

1884
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,999
TV whatever it is the Chinese
outlet but

1885
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,999
constantly and their date the
most of

1886
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,999
the globalists are actually
coming out

1887
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:15,999
of China

1888
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,999
now it is because the Chinese I
actually

1889
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,999
think they have the opportunity
oh yeah

1890
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,999
do not only be for a globalist
world but

1891
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,999
for them to run the thing and
so a

1892
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,999
nationalist event like VE Day
which is a

1893
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,999
nationalist event because we
beat Hitler

1894
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,999
of all people yeah and the
nationalist

1895
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,999
event is to be frowned upon and
the

1896
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,999
media just paid ok we'll we
will play it

1897
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,999
up we won't even mention it I
don't

1898
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:44,999
think half the people even knew
it went

1899
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:45,999
by 

1900
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,999
you're so right though and I
think we

1901
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,999
can't hammer it enough when we
should

1902
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,999
probably reiterate it's CCP
Chinese

1903
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,999
Communist Party I don't know
many

1904
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:54,999
Chinese people I'm sure they're
just

1905
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,999
like us I'm sure that they're
there in

1906
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,999
deeper crap than we are with
these

1907
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,999
a-holes running the show
there's a cool

1908
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,999
video from some Chinese guy
Chinese

1909
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,999
American guy that I put in the
show

1910
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,999
notes and it's the history of
China

1911
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:09,999
actually it's Kali I saw that
it's very

1912
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,999
full great it's called the
story of how

1913
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,999
China ruined everything

1914
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,999
and it's 30 minutes and it's
it's pretty

1915
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,999
good I mean there's it's not
complete

1916
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,999
and it's easy to skip over 5000
years

1917
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,999
here or there but I was very
impressed

1918
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:24,999
with that and you'll learn
something

1919
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,999
from it's worth is worth
watching

1920
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,999
Pompeyo is also out on the road
also

1921
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,999
speaking out against China help
really

1922
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,999
wait just before I want to just
mention

1923
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,999
one thing cuz these clips about
them

1924
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:42,999
infections in the White House
that

1925
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,999
depresses giddy over this
because

1926
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,999
they're hope and true hope and
some gets

1927
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,999
it yeah they want it but we
can't we

1928
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,999
can't forget this one element
that we

1929
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,999
must remember this one element
Trump is

1930
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,999
a germaphobe yeah and he is the

1931
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,999
likelihood of him getting it
based on

1932
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:03,999
some of the earlier reports
that we've

1933
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,999
had on how you do get it

1934
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,999
Trump's never gonna get it
unless he

1935
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,999
kisses somebody with it which
is always

1936
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:18,999
possible yeah right we know for
sure

1937
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,999
that this is actually context
CNBC's the

1938
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,999
financial news channel we know
for sure

1939
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,999
that this virus originated

1940
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,999
Wuhan China and that the disease

1941
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:28,999
emanated around the world the
Chinese

1942
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,999
Communist Party covered this up
we have

1943
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,999
been working diligently and are
working

1944
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,999
diligently today to get the
Chinese

1945
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:37,999
Communist Party to help us
identify

1946
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,999
patient zero where this began
how this

1947
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,999
came to be and this isn't about
politics

1948
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,999
this isn't about partisanship
this about

1949
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,999
protecting Americans tomorrow
this is an

1950
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,999
ongoing crisis are the world's

1951
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,999
epidemiologists still don't
know the

1952
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,999
original of this virus the
reason that

1953
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,999
we continue to ask for
transparency and

1954
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:58,999
for a reliable partner in China
is

1955
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,999
because it matters going
forward so not

1956
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,999
only do we have this current
pandemic

1957
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,999
that's taking place that we
still have

1958
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,999
to figure out how to get
therapeutics

1959
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,999
and get vaccines to mark and
all the

1960
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:09,999
things that we need this
information

1961
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,999
that only the Chinese Communist
Party

1962
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,999
has in its possession and
they're the

1963
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:15,999
only ones that can help the
world

1964
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,999
resolve this today and for our
Americans

1965
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,999
security but we got to make
sure this

1966
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:21,999
doesn't happen again

1967
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,999
so I think this is very
interesting if

1968
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,999
true he's saying that we can't
even make

1969
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,999
the vaccine without pertinent
key

1970
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,999
information that china is not
handing

1971
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,999
over I don't know if it's true
but he's

1972
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,999
saying it and there should be
questions

1973
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,999
about it hey foul cheat or hey
Bill dr.

1974
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:44,999
bill doctor professor bill yeah
yeah

1975
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,999
maybe but but well here's the
tack

1976
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,999
they're not using yet which I
think

1977
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,999
could be used and I think I
think Pompeo

1978
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,999
could do it well and it would
be uses

1979
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,999
leverage the Chinese cases of
Corona

1980
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,999
have dropped to nothing what do
they

1981
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,999
know that we don't know they
just say no

1982
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,999
Trump Xi Jinping

1983
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:09,999
there's your problem that
that's what

1984
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:15,999
would come back just briefly on

1985
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,999
therapeutics and vaccines on the

1986
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,999
therapeutic side I have a
beautiful

1987
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,999
breakdown from our official No
Agenda

1988
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,999
pharmacists many people have
noticed

1989
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:26,999
that the New England Journal of
Medicine

1990
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,999
medicine has published a new

1991
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,999
observational study regarding

1992
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,999
hydroxychloroquine and of
course it

1993
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,999
turns out to be completely
useless why

1994
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,999
would you even consider using it

1995
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,999
but it's interesting because as
our

1996
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,999
official No Agenda pharmacist
says below

1997
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:45,999
are my favorite parts which
highlight

1998
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,999
the implicit bias and the main
bias is

1999
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,999
the patient's they took Oh
besides the

2000
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,999
fact that they had no you know
what do

2001
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,999
you call it double double by no
placebo

2002
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,999
etc they only took and there
was no

2003
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:09,999
treatment with zinc here it is

2004
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,999
the AZ throw Meissen suggestion
was

2005
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,999
removed on April 12 the

2006
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:14,999
hydroxychloroquine suggestion
was

2007
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,999
removed April 29th the decision
to

2008
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,999
prescribe either either or both

2009
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,999
medications was left the
discretion of

2010
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:21,999
treating team for each interval
patient

2011
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,999
he says our pharmacist says
here's the

2012
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,999
implicit bias as the only people

2013
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,999
included in the study were
those people

2014
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,999
who needed to have moderate or
severe

2015
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,999
disease treated so they were
already in

2016
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,999
the ventilator stage which is
actually

2017
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,999
as we know from other doctors
who have

2018
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,999
successfully used
hydroxychloroquine is

2019
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,999
really too late you want to use
it much

2020
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,999
much earlier almost like
Tamiflu so it's

2021
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,999
very similar to the VA study no
placebo

2022
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,999
one one particular group of
people with

2023
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,999
a certain type of level of
illness I

2024
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,999
mean the whole thing is is
broken down

2025
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,999
in the shownotes is under
therapeutics

2026
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,999
well worth a read but a lot of
people

2027
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,999
did send in that as well as a
lot of

2028
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,999
people who have sent a very
it's kind of

2029
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,999
the same letter or email it's
the

2030
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,999
debunking of the plan Demick
documentary

2031
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,999
this is the one with dr. Judy
Mike Ovitz

2032
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,999
who has been around for years
and is

2033
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:29,999
saying the doctor foul she
should go to

2034
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,999
jail for being a criminal and
what's

2035
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,999
interesting is they all are
kind of the

2036
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,999
same these responses or the
debunking

2037
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,999
--zz and it attacks her really
more for

2038
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,999
business political reasons how
she

2039
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,999
handled herself with publishing
of

2040
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,999
studies or not Roy doesn't
address any

2041
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,999
of the many of the main issues
but the

2042
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:52,999
thing that

2043
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,999
always comes up which i think
is the

2044
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,999
mistake in this it seems like
it might

2045
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,999
be might be some form of
coordinated

2046
01:30:59,000 --> 01:30:59,999
response this is literally one
of those

2047
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,999
hey Adam a friend of mine has a
couple

2048
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,999
of nurse friends or doctor
friends and

2049
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:06,999
here's what they have to say
and then

2050
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,999
you get a four word of the
email but it

2051
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,999
always says in there that dr.
Mike Ovitz

2052
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,999
claims there's never been an RN
a

2053
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,999
vaccine and in every single one
of these

2054
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,999
debunking responses it's oh
yeah are you

2055
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,999
kidding me there's tons of them

2056
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,999
this vaccines for all kinds of
RNA

2057
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,999
viruses yeah but that's the
difference

2058
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,999
there's vaccines for RNA
viruses the RNA

2059
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,999
vaccine that is being discussed
that

2060
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,999
actually felt M R an mRNA has
well you

2061
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,999
looked into it right you had a
thing for

2062
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,999
me to put in the show notes
yeah that

2063
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,999
debt paper which discusses the
mRNA

2064
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,999
vaccine which is a which is a an

2065
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,999
experimental idea it's not do
get all

2066
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,999
the RNA vaccines are based on
the

2067
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,999
old-fashioned way view you
cultivate the

2068
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,999
the the disease and then you've
used

2069
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,999
attenuated versions or killing
right you

2070
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,999
put you grow it and then kill
it and you

2071
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,999
do all these different things
to make a

2072
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:08,999
vaccine is just a normal way of
making a

2073
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,999
vaccine this is this mRNA
vaccine is a

2074
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,999
totally different animal it's
never been

2075
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,999
proven to work and so like yeah
so to

2076
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,999
the fact that this was a good
paper on

2077
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,999
it and that's what I when
somebody sent

2078
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,999
me that same exact thing you
got some

2079
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,999
put some stooge to this in this
paper

2080
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,999
and I said here read this the
the thing

2081
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,999
that I like the most is that
they said

2082
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,999
there's never that's a lie

2083
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,999
they've been tons of RNA
vaccines like

2084
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,999
okay this has got to be someone
who

2085
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:41,999
doesn't know what they're
talking about

2086
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,999
so the debunkers are being
debunked but

2087
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,999
there's about three of them in
the

2088
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,999
shownotes under the bronx you
can look

2089
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,999
it up there any more clips to
do in this

2090
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,999
Rona segment I want to guess is
we're

2091
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,999
talking about Bochy debunking
our

2092
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,999
let's listen to the talking cat
yeah

2093
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,999
been waiting for almost an hour
and a

2094
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,999
half period she talks here she
talks

2095
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,999
about pouch II and again and it
just add

2096
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,999
anti foul foul Chi rats very
well

2097
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,999
structured the scientific
evidence is

2098
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:18,999
what needs to drive us and we
appreciate

2099
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,999
the fears of the American
people but we

2100
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,999
don't want to have policy that
would

2101
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,999
have negative unintended
consequences

2102
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,999
that's actually fairly
reasonable but

2103
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,999
that's a quote from 2014 when
he was

2104
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:31,999
talking about whether or not we
should

2105
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,999
quarantine for Ebola

2106
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,999
another interesting quote of
Anthony a

2107
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,999
slouchy and the director of the
National

2108
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,999
Institute of Allergy and
Infectious

2109
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:40,999
Diseases 

2110
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:41,999
that the CIA forgot to scrub
from

2111
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,999
history is when he said that
there is no

2112
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,999
doubt that Donald J Trump
President of

2113
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,999
the United States will be
confronted

2114
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:49,999
with a surprise infectious
disease

2115
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,999
outbreak during his presidency
he likely

2116
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:54,999
said well rubbing his hands
together and

2117
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,999
then cackling to the sky for
several

2118
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,999
minutes when questioned about
concerns

2119
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,999
for the future trump
administration foul

2120
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,999
she reportedly said that there
was the

2121
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,999
potential for a new influenza
pandemic

2122
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:07,999
and outbreaks of diseases that
are not

2123
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,999
yet on anyone's radar the issue
of

2124
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,999
pandemic preparedness and if
there's one

2125
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,999
message that I want to leave
with you

2126
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,999
today based on my experience
and you'll

2127
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,999
see that in a moment is that
there is no

2128
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,999
question that there will be a
challenge

2129
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,999
to the coming administration in
the

2130
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,999
arena of infectious diseases
both

2131
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,999
chronic infectious diseases in
the sense

2132
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,999
of already ongoing disease and
we have

2133
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,999
certainly a large burden of
that but

2134
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,999
also there will be a surprise
outbreak

2135
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,999
he has the same doctor found
you who

2136
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,999
according to this WikiLeaks
email loves

2137
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:50,999

verbatim reading

2138
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:51,999

seconds

2200
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,999
of posting the show the NAR
kissed were

2201
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,999

01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,999
did we get good wink because we
did an

2207
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,999
image search we looked for this
wing we

2208
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,999
found similar stuff but not
exactly that

2209
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,999
and lo and behold there it is
on some

2210
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,999
image did you follow any of
this John

2211
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:11,999
did you follow her this going
down I

2212
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,999
thought the final leg of it
which is

2213
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,999
this is a piece of licensed art
the guy

2214
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:22,999
has a license now that's a no
agenda

2215
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,999
producer for you right there
I'm not

2216
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,999
gonna compromise my boys
putting the

2217
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,999
tribes art that you could find
maybe if

2218
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,999
you searched around not with
the no

2219
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,999
agenda other stuff on it and
it's been

2220
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,999
altered like you do with
licensed art

2221
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,999
but he license he likes a lot
okay this

2222
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,999
first bring up a couple of
there you go

2223
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,999
that parent League comic strip
bloggers

2224
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,999
unfamiliar with including the
piece art

2225
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:48,999
that he actually did still some
time ago

2226
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,999
a little Santa Claus thing
which could

2227
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,999
have been licensed any but he
didn't

2228
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,999
like now don't think for
commercial

2229
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,999
artists they licensed certain
kinds of

2230
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,999
clipart and different kinds of
very

2231
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:04,999
specialized looking to tends to
be

2232
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,999
stylized and they will like
there would

2233
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:08,999
take out licenses from these
different

2234
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,999
places and in one or two of
them and

2235
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,999
then they'll use the stuff
judiciously

2236
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,999
as projects come and go and
it's part of

2237
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,999
the deal and this is done with
video

2238
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,999
more even so even more so than
it is

2239
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,999
with art there's a number so

2240
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,999
there's a couple named Evo the
guy's

2241
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,999
meteo itself didn't use them
but the

2242
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,999
guys had licenses and if you
watch

2243
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,999
almost any of the every time I
said

2244
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,999
watch anybody's presentation
see the

2245
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,999
spinning logo come in and flame
the the

2246
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,999
big ball but explosion of
flames as all

2247
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,999
these things come from one
particular

2248
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,999
site whose name I could always
forget I

2249
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,999
always have to ask Nick we
about it

2250
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,999
what's the name of that site
again but

2251
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,999
it is one site just like its
cost like a

2252
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,999
dollar to dice and some of the
most

2253
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,999
spectacular videos that you've
ever seen

2254
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,999
yeah and and everybody
subscribes to

2255
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,999
these services and so we have a
couple

2256
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,999
of artists I'm sure more than
one Muslim

2257
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,999
can listen to the show and do
live art

2258
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,999
on this fly but we do it this
is a

2259
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,999
example of a licensed pro well
done

2260
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,999
people oh I hope I explained
that yeah

2261
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,999
absolutely 

2262
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,999
anyway I just thought it was
funny the

2263
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:22,999
NARC aswer out that was just
funny

2264
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,999
they're so competitive it's so

2265
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,999
competitive if it's competitive
it

2266
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:28,999
should be yeah

2267
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,999
well thank you Trent Trent drak
for the

2268
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,999
artwork for episode 1240 this
is great

2269
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,999
because we're one of the only
podcast if

2270
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,999
not the only podcast that every
single

2271
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,999
show we release has new album
art it

2272
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,999
shows up in your podcast
players most of

2273
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,999
them will show it and it's
exciting when

2274
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,999
you see it in an overview and
it's this

2275
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,999
is something about the show and
it's a

2276
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,999
part of what what you know what
the

2277
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,999
package matters Packaging
matters we

2278
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,999
learned that from Steve Jobs we
are the

2279
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,999
iPhone of podcasts actually you
think

2280
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,999
about it your little white box
yes

2281
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,999
that's so no agenda art
generator calm

2282
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,999
is where the artists compete
but it's a

2283
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:09,999
fun friendly competition
everybody has a

2284
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,999
good time and we laugh about it
and we

2285
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:13,999
love comic strip blog or just
messin

2286
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,999
with him because ladies comics
your

2287
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,999
blogger he deserves it you
blocked him

2288
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,999
everywhere I have to deal with
the

2289
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:23,999
fallout when you say these
things so

2290
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,999
stop it just stop

2291
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,999
no agenda art generator calm
then we

2292
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,999
have more values art I uses I
probably

2293
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,999
use more comic strip blogger
stuff for

2294
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:34,999
the newsletter

2295
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,999
no and you don't even follow
him you're

2296
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:42,999
a heathen these are too much of
a back

2297
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,999
channel or from that's the only
problem

2298
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,999
part of our like part of our
value for

2299
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,999
value network here at the no
agenda

2300
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,999
media tribe is the way the
system works

2301
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,999
everything you've heard up to
date we

2302
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,999
can give you the narrative at
least the

2303
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,999
one we hear we believe or what
we're

2304
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,999
finding out from actual sources
because

2305
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,999
we're not run by pharmaceutical

2306
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,999
companies or by China or by
anybody else

2307
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,999
for that reason it's you the
producers

2308
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,999
and we love to thank our
executive and

2309
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,999
associate executive producers
as soon as

2310
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,999
we have quite a few maybe we
should get

2311
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:15,999
to it

2312
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,999
All Right bingo boom way more
than

2313
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,999
normal and I want to thank each
and

2314
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:20,999
every one of them and I don't
think it's

2315
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,999
because a mother's day and
maybe because

2316
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,999
we triggered some thoughts or
the ve-day

2317
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,999
mention but well I you look you
should

2318
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,999
say happy Mother's Day and and
we will

2319
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,999
say happy Mother's Day to all
the moms

2320
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,999
out there and yes it was
surprising

2321
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,999
because while we're at it
here's what's

2322
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:37,999
not really a Hallmark holiday
by the way

2323
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,999
nobody here's what we're
surprising is

2324
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,999
typically we do a Mother's Day
promotion

2325
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,999
and the joke is that you know
we get

2326
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,999
five people and said no agenda
producers

2327
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,999
hate their moms and so this
year we did

2328
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,999
nothing like it's Mother's Day
and

2329
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,999
everyone's like beautiful notes
to mom

2330
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,999
starting with stretc rooming
with you

2331
01:42:59,000 --> 01:42:59,999
who gave us a thousand dollars
in two

2332
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,999
dollars and forty two forty one
cents on

2333
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,999
top of that little Utah wait to
see it

2334
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,999
instantize he says last week
observing

2335
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,999
all this to stand here X's
glass shields

2336
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,999
polka-dots masks oh I see only
marketing

2337
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,999
t-shirts I thought I have done
a hell of

2338
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,999
a job gratifying this game of
finding

2339
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,999
this so this is that's the
bonus kovat

2340
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,999
is the death of truth no agenda
is the

2341
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:24,999
opposite of whatever that is
one of the

2342
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,999
very few places where truth
exists fuck

2343
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,999
a duck thank you for this is
this was

2344
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:31,999

zoology I realize that all
these is back

2351
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,999
to mac and cheese long for long
for

2352
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,999
simpler days where no agenda
was wins

2353
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,999
awards and with recipes oatmeal

01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,999
Bill Gates dr. bill someday had

2646
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:34,999
triggered me when I was
listening to RFK

2647
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,999
clips was that the coincidence
of this

2648
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,999
Kennedy family and specifically
the RFK

2649
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,999
branch suffered a loss recently
when may

2650
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,999
mmmm Kennedy drowned while
kayaking meth

2651
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,999
as you may know was the public
health

2652
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,999
official Mao working for the
USDA's

2653
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,999
global aids program

2654
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,999
what about coincidences one
would think

2655
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,999
on another note here in the
eurozone the

2656
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,999
erosion continues now with the
red

2657
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,999
judges of Carl Sewell laying an
AED for

2658
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,999
the ECB stimulus program and the

2659
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,999
European Court almost instantly
replying

2660
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,999
that the German Constitutional
Court

2661
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,999
lacks the legal power to judge
on the

2662
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,999
European institutions role
completely

2663
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,999
ignoring the German Federal
Constitution

2664
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:18,999
that specifically defines the
role of

2665
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,999
the Constitution visa vie
international

2666
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,999
treaties they really don't
wanna clap

2667
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,999
one thing is certain the longer
the

2668
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,999
rhone of crisis lingers the
better the

2669
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,999
odds are for EU implosion you
know in

2670
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:31,999
the meantime I'm now wearing a
hipster

2671
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,999
ponytail as hairdressers are
still shut

2672
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,999
and I already need to get a
haircut

2673
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,999
three months ago yeah if this
is the

2674
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:39,999
worst of this lockdown I'll
take it in

2675
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,999
reality the power grab of our
civil

2676
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:42,999
liberties is without precedent
and I'm

2677
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,999
wondering how long the
obedience will

2678
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,999
last even in the sheeple will
eventually

2679
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:47,999

2680
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,999

Jason Perry in East Peter

02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,999
to get my message on the
donation but

2742
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,999
here it is okay let's let's
contemplate

2743
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,999
what he just said there
couldn't figure

2744
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,999
out how to get my message on my
donation

2745
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,999
but here it is what he did it he

2746
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,999
couldn't figure it out he's
just letting

2747
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,999
you know he had some trouble
but it

2748
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,999
worked out I've been a listener
for five

2749
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,999
years number look upon this
back by luck

2750
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,999
when searching for podcasts and
never

2751
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,999
donated supposedly that means a
douche D

2752
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:30,999
douching yes you've been
deduced how

2753
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,999
many people we found you
through that

2754
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,999
that mechanism through was
probably not

to use this opportunity to
teach them

2817
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,999
about things such as open
debate about

2818
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:02,999
ideas very good iing slaves to
those

perspective of

02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,999
that knowing that no agenda has
brought

2827
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,999
to our household amid the
paranoid

2828
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,999

universe I was further
encouraged by

02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,999
Elon Musk's remark on Rogen
about corona

2997
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,999

2998
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:25,999
been deconstructing in the past
two

2999
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:26,999

Clippers

3043
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,999
for the last Jonas wanted to
play it

3044
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:37,999
because it's just kind of
stand-alone

3045
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,999
and it's a and I want somebody
in

3046
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:41,999
Australia to tell me who this
woman is

3047
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,999
she's like a Katie Hopkins of
Australia

3048
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:49,999
mm-hmm and so she kind of rails
I this

3049
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,999
is only 31 seconds of something
I went

3050
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:52,999
for a couple of minutes because
she just

3051
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,999
kept laying into Joe Biden and
she's in

3052
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:57,999
Australia which is I find

02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,999
including the fake Native
American

3058
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:09,999
Elizabeth 

3059
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,999

3066
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:30,999
frontrunner to be the Democrats

3067
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:41,999

pretty

3068
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:43,999

3069
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,999

02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,999
is which is the wimpy guy
bright and

3073
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:57,999

3074
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,999

alright done

3081
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:26,999
more we could have done more

3082
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,999
we could've definitely that one
again we

3083
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,999
could have done more I like it
because

3084
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,999
but we could have done more
yeah that's

3085
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:37,999
actually not bad that that's
yeah I

3086
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:39,999

3105
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:35,999
update there's about the
reopening

3106
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,999
state-by-state the country is
beginning

3107
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,999
to face the reality of a slow
recovery

3108
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,999
ahead from the Koba 19 pandemic

3109
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,999
companies are considering ways
to bring

3110
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,999
workers back but the
unemployment rate

3111
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,999
is staggering whether you are
here in

3112
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:50,999
New York where there is still a
strict

3113
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:52,999
lockdown order or in an area
reopening

3114
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,999
this is a challenging time
let's get

3115
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:58,999
started with today's top news
cases of

3116
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:00,999
Kovach 19 continue to slow in
most of

3117
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:04,999
the country do you view it
after two

3118
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:06,999
months there were more
reopening zuv

3119
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,999
barbershops salons restaurants
and

3120
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:10,999
public spaces but the rules
differ

3121
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:12,999
state-by-state in New York
where a

3122
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:14,999
lockdown remains for much of
the state

3123
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:15,999
Governor Andrew Cuomo said

3124
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,999
hospitalizations new cases and
deaths

3125
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,999
from the virus dropped again
today but

3126
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:22,999
Cuomo said three children have
died from

3127
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,999
a new syndrome associated with
Kovac 19

3128
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:28,999
and there are 73 reported cases
it's

3129
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:32,999
inflammation of the blood
vessels which

3130
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,999
can then cause problems with
their

3131
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,999
fortune Cuomo said parents need
to be

3132
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:39,999
vigilant while New York health
officials

3133
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:41,999
work with the CDC to
investigate this

3134
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,999
new syndrome nationwide there
have now

3135
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,999
been more than 77 thousand
deaths from

3136
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:49,999
coke at 19 and more than 1.2
million

3137
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:53,999
confirmed cases also today
after reports

3138
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:54,999
at the Trump administration

3139
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:56,999
shelve the guidance from the
Centers for

3140
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:58,999
Disease Control and Prevention
on how to

3141
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:00,999
reopen the country the White
House

3142
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:01,999
issued a statement from the
director of

3143
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,999
the CDC Robert Redfield that
said the

3144
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,999
plan quote was in draft form
and had not

3145
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:08,999
been vetted you seriously I'd
rather

3146
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,999
have Kovac 19 than listen to
that report

3147
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:18,999
again that was bad that was
uninspiring

3148
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:23,999
was not as bad as his lighting

3149
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:27,999
he at home yeah yeah he was now
at home

3150
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:28,999

02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:30,999
him you know cuz the lighting

3152
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:32,999
the guys that can make you look

02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:34,999

Boris

3154
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,999
Karloff playing Frankenstein
Wow okay

3155
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,999

it's also to South Korea in
Italy once

3159
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:50,999
the center of the global
pandemic the

3160
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,999
lockdown is starting to ease
many bars

3161
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,999
in Rome were open today for
takeaway

3162
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,999
drinks but officials warn the
social

3163
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,999
distancing must be maintained
to prevent

3164
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:01,999
a resurgence in coronavirus
cases in

3165
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:03,999
South Korea the mayor of Seoul
closed

3166
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,999
more than 2,000 nightclubs just
one week

3167
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:08,999
after they were reopened dozens
of new

3168
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:10,999
coronavirus cases were
connected to

3169
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:14,999
people who attended clubs last
week hmm

3170
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,999
not much going on there so that
was

3171
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,999
pretty dull you're right yeah
so let's

3172
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:20,999
go and take a look at that this
is the

3173
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:22,999
cove in russia and comparing
russia to

3174
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:24,999
belarus let's look at what's
happening

3175
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:26,999
internationally Russia like most

3176
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:28,999
countries has scaled back its

3177
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:29,999
celebrations to mark the end of
the

3178
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,999
second world war in Europe
because of

3179
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,999
the virus pandemic but in
neighboring

3180
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,999
Belarus one of the only
countries yet to

3181
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,999
impose any social distancing
measures

3182
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,999
thousands have gathered to mark
the 75th

3183
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,999
anniversary from Moscow skies
down a

3184
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,999
magnet has this report

3185
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,999
even Russia has postponed this
year's

3186
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,999
Victory Day parade but it's
smaller

3187
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,999
neighbor to the west Belarus
has not

3188
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:58,999
despite more than 20,000 covet
cases the

3189
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:00,999
veterans were encouraged not to
come

3190
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:04,999
others incentivized to fill
seats good

3191
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:06,999
grades promised to students for
example

3192
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:08,999
at a time when many in Belarus
don't

3193
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,999
trust their president on this
pandemic

3194
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:14,999
most newcomer one the official
count is

3195
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,999
of a hundred and sixteen deaths
the

3196
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,999
freshly dug graves at this
Cemetery in

3197
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:21,999
the small city of stones B
suggests it's

3198
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,999
far more fear of my doom this
reporter

3199
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,999
for Russia's Channel one was
expelled

3200
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,999
from Belarus and his team
stripped of

3201
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,999
their accreditations after this
report

3202
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:33,999
which suggested that even
locals don't

3203
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:37,999
believe the numbers Anna Lilla
through

3204
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:38,999
this woman telling him

3205
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,999
her mother had had kovat but
that the

3206
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:42,999
official cause of death was
heart

3207
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:47,999
failure the picture inside
hospitals

3208
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,999
even in the capital is grim
every piece

3209
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,999
of space is used up here and
there's

3210
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:56,999
that ubiquitous co vidcom where
the

3211
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:58,999
state is failing volunteers are
stepping

3212
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:02,999
in the ubiquitous covered COFF
has that

3213
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,999
been identified as a specific
type of

3214
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,999
cough yeah well that's what JC
when he

3215
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:11,999
had Kovac and these survived it
easily

3216
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:13,999
enough but he ended up with
that Kovac

3217
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:15,999
caught the cotton that lasts a
while I

3218
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,999
did last as long you know how
you get

3219
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:19,999
sometimes you get to coal or
somebody

3220
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:21,999
gets into this just coughed
that never

3221
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,999
goes away gonna last and last
and last

3222
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,999
you know people that I think
horowitz

3223
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:27,999
had it for like three four
shows I like

3224
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:28,999
a month he had this cough this
terrible

3225
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,999
call the covet cough which is
really

3226
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,999
horrible to hear it it's like
it's

3227
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:35,999
horrible to hear it I mean it's
just a

3228
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:39,999
cringe oh it didn't last long
at all

3229
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:43,999
which is good no that is good
that is

3230
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,999
good let me see if we can find
an

3231
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,999
example of this Co good cause
it's it

3232
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:49,999
sounds like it sounds like it's

3233
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:51,999
somebody's coffee and then you
hear a

3234
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:56,999
goose honking here we have a
couple of

3235
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:58,999
examples the the

3236
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,999
is does this sound like you on
YouTube

3237
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,999
that may be exactly what we're
looking

3238
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:05,999
for let's see and why don't I
hear

3239
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:07,999
anything 

3240
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:14,999
is that it no no really no
that's your

3241
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:16,999
fake to a higher gear there's a
very

3242
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:18,999
specific thing it does it is
like really

3243
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:19,999
frightening to hear it

3244
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:24,999
the ghovat caught yes I got an
email

3245
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,999
which may fit into a good topic
for us

3246
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:29,999
today and I and I want to
reiterate that

3247
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:31,999
this show John I come to each
show we

3248
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:32,999
don't talk to each other in
between

3249
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,999
shows rarely maybe an email or
something

3250
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,999
typically John sending me some
chick on

3251
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,999
YouTube whose hey guys whatever

3252
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:44,999
that's usually what I get from
John so

3253
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:46,999
we show up and I have my stuff
he has

3254
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:48,999
his stuff and I received an
email that I

3255
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:50,999
wanted to respond to I thought
that it

3256
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:51,999
would be appropriate I see that
you've

3257
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:53,999
got some clips to talk about it
this is

3258
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,999
from Roland he's from Germany
German

3259
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:58,999
producer in the morning gents
I'm not

3260
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,999
sure how voting works but in
Germany

3261
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:03,999
it's like this you get a
postcard with

3262
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:04,999
your name on it the city knows
where you

3263
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:06,999
live is you have to register
when you

3264
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,999
move to it tells you when and
where you

3265
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:10,999
can go and vote historically
it's been

3266
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:12,999
on Sundays between 8:00 and 6p
at 8 a.m.

3267
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,999
6 p.m. if you're out of town
and you

3268
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:15,999
can't make it to the voting
place

3269
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:17,999
usually a school or
kindergarten in your

3270
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:19,999
neighborhood can send you the
postcard

3271
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:21,999
back at no charge you can ask
for

3272
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:23,999
vote-by-mail papers which you
then get

3273
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,999
and send back in time done well
now this

3274
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:27,999
apparently isn't much of a
thing in the

3275
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,999
US what is wrong what is the
problem why

3276
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,999
are you all so jacked up about
it some

3277
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:35,999
analysis would be helpful
especially to

3278
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,999
the international listeners I
think

3279
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:38,999
that's an appropriate question
Roland

3280
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:42,999
well I have two clips on this
bingo boom

3281
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:46,999
first of all you can't vote by
mail in

3282
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:48,999
some some states in fact that's
all you

3283
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:48,999
do 

3284
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:50,999
you don't even there's not even
this

3285
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:51,999
processor you're talking about

3286
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:53,999
Washington State for example
there's a

3287
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:57,999
100% vote by mail ah there's a
lot of

3288
02:26:58,000 --> 02:26:59,999
people that believe that it
invites

3289
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:03,999
fraud and allow me to explain
the as I

3290
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,999
understand the fraud part of it
in the

3291
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:08,999
United States and this is why
it's an

3292
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:09,999
issue 

3293
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,999
we I I hate to say it but our
voting

3294
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,999
public is pretty dumb so when
someone

3295
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:17,999
knocks on your door and says
hey did you

3296
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:19,999
get your mail-in voting bally's
that I

3297
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:20,999
don't know man it's around here

3298
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:20,999
somewhere 

3299
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,999
well listen why don't you just
you know

3300
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:27,999
just I'll take care of it I'm
gonna hand

3301
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:28,999
it in just what do you want to
be

3302
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:30,999
Democrat right okay we just
write this

3303
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:31,999
down and I'll mail it for you
don't have

3304
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:32,999
to worry about it

3305
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,999
it's called harvesting and
sometimes

3306
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:36,999
they'll get ballots that are
just empty

3307
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,999
and they'll fill it in for them
it's

3308
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,999
theirs and this is I think was
Orange

3309
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:42,999
County 

3310
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:44,999
there are Calabasas somewhere
in in

3311
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:46,999
California where they followed
these

3312
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:48,999
people and showed how they do
it and

3313
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,999
this is not just the US but its
but this

3314
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,999
is harvesting is a real issue
and also I

3315
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,999
think it's just lame as a
citizen you go

3316
02:27:58,000 --> 02:27:59,999
into the booth and you kick the
lever

3317
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:01,999
and you go there you stand the
line with

3318
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:03,999
everybody grousing about it
it's part of

3319
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:07,999
your ID by the way well no
that's

3320
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:09,999
different well in Texas but for
a bid

3321
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,999
yeah Texas you have to show
your ID well

3322
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:14,999
here's a question here's a good
example

3323
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:16,999
if this is what you have to
deal with

3324
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,999
this is on PBS again and
they're having

3325
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:21,999
this this problem in
Connecticut because

3326
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,999
Connecticut you can do an
absentee

3327
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,999
ballot but it's a very
complicated

3328
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,999
process and the problem with
Connecticut

3329
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,999
is what the story's about
mostly is that

3330
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,999
they the Connecticut
Constitution says

3331
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,999
you have to show up yes so it's
not like

3332
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:37,999
Washington state it's like it's

3333
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,999
designing the systems designed
for vote

3334
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,999
vote by mail and by the way
it's funny

3335
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:43,999
how the harvesters do such a
good job

3336
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,999
they tend to get a state loaded
with

3337
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:48,999
Democrats I'm not gonna just
accuse the

3338
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:50,999
Democrats but when you hear
reports like

3339
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,999
this here's the vote by mail
fraud

3340
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:54,999
question that was asked on the
PBS

3341
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,999
amongst some people that are
discussing

3342
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:59,999
how to do this in Connecticut
we just

3343
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,999
six months until November's
presidential

3344
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:03,999
election states across the
country are

3345
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:05,999
trying to determine how they
will safely

3346
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,999
collect and count ballots
during a

3347
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:09,999
national health emergency for
many

3348
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:11,999
states that means reevaluating
in person

3349
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,999
versus absentee voting just
yesterday

3350
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:15,999
California governor Gavin Newsom

3351
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:16,999
announced that the entire state
would be

3352
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:18,999
asked to vote by mail in the
November

3353
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:20,999
Action bought four states like

3354
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:22,999
Connecticut with a long history
of

3355
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,999
in-person voting the push to
vote by

3356
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,999
mail remains a complicated task
Newshour

3357
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,999
weekend's Christopher Booker
has more

3358
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:32,999
the scenes from Wisconsin's
recent

3359
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:33,999
election did not sit well with

3360
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:35,999
Connecticut's Secretary of
State Denis

3361
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,999
Merrill that was a turning
point in my

3362
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:40,999
discussions with both the
legislative

3363
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,999
leadership and the governor
nobody wants

3364
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,999
to look like Milwaukee frankly
and that

3365
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,999
that can happen pretty easily

3366
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:49,999
after Democratic governor Tony
Evers

3367
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:51,999
executive order that delayed
the state's

3368
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,999
election by two months was
overturned by

3369
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:56,999
the Supreme Court Wisconsin
voters had

3370
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:58,999
to go to polling places if they
wanted

3371
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,999
to cast a ballot 52 people who
worked

3372
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,999
the polls or voted on April 7th
have

3373
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:05,999
tested positive for kovat 19 the

3374
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:07,999
situation Merril does not want
to

3375
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,999
duplicate in her state you know
people

3376
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,999
are just waking up to the fact
that they

3377
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,999
may be asked to vote either in
a primary

3378
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:17,999
or particularly in the general
election

3379
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:19,999
is their concern and jeopardize
their

3380
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,999
health and I think the Milwaukee

3381
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:23,999
situation really galvanized
people

3382
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:25,999
because it was all over
television and

3383
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:27,999
people were home watching it
but hoping

3384
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:29,999
to minimize in-person voting in

3385
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:31,999
Connecticut will not be an easy
task

3386
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:33,999
with voting laws dating back to
the

3387
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,999
state's 1818 Constitution the
rules to

3388
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,999
vote absentee or by mail in the
state

3389
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:41,999
nicknamed the Constitution
state are

3390
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,999
restrictive yeah that's a decent

3391
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,999
overview well that's a decent
order that

3392
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:49,999
was the wrong clip the one you
told me

3393
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:53,999
to play vote by mail fraud
question oh

3394
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:57,999
it was the wrong clip but
that's a

3395
02:30:58,000 --> 02:30:59,999
better clip for the intro to
this clip I

3396
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:00,999
would have had it I should have
actually

3397
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:01,999
played that clip first so you

3398
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:03,999
accidentally did the right
thing voter

3399
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:05,999
fraud is a major talking point
for those

3400
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,999
against expanding vote by mail
on April

3401
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:09,999
8th President Trump tweeted that

3402
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,999
Republicans should fight very
hard when

3403
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:13,999
it comes to statewide mail and
voting

3404
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:15,999
Democrats are clamoring for it

3405
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:17,999
tremendous potential for voter
fraud and

3406
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:19,999
for whatever reason doesn't
work out

3407
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,999
well for Republicans voter
fraud comes

3408
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:24,999
up quite often have you seen
rampant

3409
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,999
voter fraud in Connecticut oh
absolutely

3410
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:28,999
not 

3411
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:29,999
I mean for people to complain
about

3412
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,999
absentee ballot fraud in
Connecticut is

3413
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:33,999
really 

3414
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,999
kind of ridiculous because we
have so

3415
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:38,999
many processes in place first
you have

3416
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:40,999
to mail the application to
people they

3417
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:42,999
have to fill it out mail it
back to the

3418
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:44,999
clerk the clerk then mails the
ballot to

3419
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,999
the person which is in a double
envelope

3420
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:49,999
you have to put it in an inside
envelope

3421
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:50,999
and then in an outside envelope
to

3422
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,999
protect their anonymity and
then you

3423
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:55,999
mail it back to the clerk and
during all

3424
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,999
this process the clerk has to
note every

3425
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,999
step of the way in our
electronic voter

3426
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:03,999
registry secretary Merrill says
there's

3427
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:05,999
little evidence that there is
widespread

3428
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:07,999
voter fraud in Connecticut can
you point

3429
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,999
to specific instances of voter
fraud in

3430
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:12,999
Connecticut I don't have them
on me but

3431
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:14,999
we deal with these every year
we end up

3432
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:18,999
having a lot of kind of quirky
election

3433
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:19,999
issues that I don't
particularly find

3434
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,999
coincidental but it's something
we need

3435
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:24,999
to address the critics of
expanded

3436
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,999
vote-by-mail often cite voter
fraud is

3437
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:29,999
there evidence that when you
increase

3438
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,999
the access to vote by mail fraud

3439
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:36,999
increases none there's no
evidence none

3440
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,999
whatsoever no where it does not
exist

3441
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:43,999
oh I'm poorly informed then
yeah you

3442
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:44,999
don't know what you're talking
about I

3443
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:46,999
need to shut up right because
she said

3444
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,999
right there that Democrat woman
she said

3445
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:55,999
no no never happened ever
happens I know

3446
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:55,999
what you're talking about

3447
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,999
by the way just because you go
you walk

3448
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:00,999
into the good like for example
here at

3449
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:02,999
the house I walk in that mail
has been

3450
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,999
there's two or three ballots
sitting

3451
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:05,999
there I could pick any with any
one of

3452
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,999
them up we had type a bunch of
stuff I'd

3453
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:09,999
put stuff on their sign
somebody's phony

3454
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:13,999
name send it in I could do that
anyone

3455
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:14,999
could do it or somebody they'd
lose some

3456
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:16,999
mail somebody steals from a
post office

3457
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:17,999
box 

3458
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:18,999
I mean that's just minor but the

3459
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:20,999
harvesting which you pointed
out which

3460
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:22,999
has always been that the big
threat and

3461
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:24,999
the joke of it is the Democrats
always

3462
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,999
hated much of this because it
would be

3463
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,999
well I mean the Republicans
used to hate

3464
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:31,999
this for the reasons that the
Democrats

3465
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:33,999
used to like it which is in the
deep

3466
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,999
south back in the 50s and 60s
they would

3467
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:38,999
just the Democrats would steal
all the

3468
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,999
black votes just rouse the
black votes

3469
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:43,999
they just steal them they steal
the

3470
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,999
black vote or they buy a vote
they say

3471
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:48,999
there's another way of doing it
before

3472
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:49,999
harvesting you go up to
everybody you go

3473
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:51,999
door-to-door so I'll give you
five bucks

3474
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:53,999
for your ballot is that illegal
I I

3475
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:55,999
think it's a farce it's illegal
is it

3476
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:00,999
yeah what is illegal raise the
league is

3477
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:02,999
it illegal to say to someone
here's five

3478
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:03,999
bucks 

3479
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,999
write down your vote right now
that's

3480
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:08,999
not illegal well probably not
it's not

3481
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:10,999
exactly what politics is I'm
gonna give

3482
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:12,999
you this for your vote isn't
that okay

3483
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:16,999
we should the ditch it's it's
asking for

3484
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:20,999
trouble go well there's that
yeah but

3485
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:22,999
this woman when I heard that
clip we're

3486
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:27,999
at the very end of that clip
she goes oh

3487
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:32,999
then I know something's up how
do we

3488
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:34,999
usually put that somewhere we
had a

3489
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:36,999
thing about that that we could
see oh

3490
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:41,999
yeah that's not it where is it
ah we had

3491
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:43,999
nothing to see here I've lost
so many

3492
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,999
I'm losing my touch

3493
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,999
you are just a eyeball nothing
it's not

3494
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:50,999
completely healed I'll give you
that but

3495
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:58,999
it's not that bad for a long
time I know

3496
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:00,999
that's why I couldn't find it
you know

3497
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:07,999
it's been replaced by so you
know what

3498
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:09,999
it's taking place now is we
have this

3499
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:13,999
political fight which trump is
ch

3500
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:14,999
tweeting about a lot so I guess
he's

3501
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:20,999
worried is this you know the
the house

3502
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,999
is looking to make legislation
and I

3503
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,999
guess you can do it by state
even to

3504
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:28,999
vote by mail because all
coronavirus be

3505
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:29,999
too dangerous for people to
show up and

3506
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,999
vote same is the to danger for
them to

3507
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,999
show up at the grocery store
and stand

3508
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:36,999
in line is it too dangerous to
go to the

3509
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:38,999
haircutter I mean why is this
more

3510
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:39,999
dangerous than these other
things that

3511
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:41,999
people do constantly if there's
a shop

3512
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:43,999
that says haircutter I'm not
going

3513
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:47,999
that's a dangerous shop it says
coops

3514
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:52,999
that's a different story so
there is a

3515
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,999
lot going on in the political
in fact

3516
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:57,999
pretty much all of it is now
political

3517
02:35:58,000 --> 02:35:59,999
and I have been enjoying

3518
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:03,999
these transcripts from the is
that the

3519
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,999
house intelligence Oversight
Committee

3520
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,999

3521
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:14,999

02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:26,999
and saying well how great it
was that

3526
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:28,999
they were released now let's
just go

3527
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:32,999
over this before we play before
we play

3528
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:37,999
Kaylee and Yumi she now has
Flynn been

3529
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,999
exonerated or is that just bar
saying it

3530
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:41,999
has to happen the judge hasn't
done it

3531
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:45,999
yet he's he actually exonerate
exonerate

3532
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:47,999
dropped all charges well in
case it's

3533
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:49,999
not no no I take it back

3534
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:50,999
you gotta use this right
because you're

3535
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:52,999
getting jumped on by all these
guys that

3536
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:54,999
are gonna write your note it's
not

3537
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,999
exoneration when the cases drop
was it

3538
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,999
cases dismissed rights
dismissed and

3539
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:02,999
what is interesting about the
dismissal

3540
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:06,999
as that it comes from now
overwhelming

3541
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,999
evidence from the FBI's own
files that

3542
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,999
they were railroading Flint yeah

3543
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,999
absolutely railroading him like
like

3544
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,999
real assholes like real thugs
really not

3545
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,999
okay stuff but then he fight
it's one of

3546
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:22,999
these old Russian things like
Barry I

3547
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,999
used to do you know said show
me a man

3548
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,999
I'll find you a crime right in
addition

3549
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:30,999
to this very old stalinistic
idea as a

3550
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:31,999
way to do it and that's what
they were

3551
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:33,999
doing and it was but an Obama
was behind

3552
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,999
it well this is what's
interesting so

3553
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:40,999
now we have in in this case all
of a

3554
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:42,999
sudden we have 53 transcripts

3555
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,999
Declassified of all of these
players and

3556
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:47,999
this is the hours and hours and
hours of

3557
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,999
testimony it's very interesting
to read

3558
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,999
I was interested in Brad parse
Cal the

3559
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:55,999
guy who's who is now the
campaign

3560
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,999
manager the for 2020 the guy
was just a

3561
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:02,999
web dude in Texas in San
Antonio who

3562
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:03,999
didn't you know like the
wineries did a

3563
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:07,999
one-pager website for Ivanka's
thing

3564
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:09,999
and you just and they said well
we're

3565
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:11,999
gonna explode 2015 I
exploratory you

3566
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:13,999
throw up a page for Canada
trompe to see

3567
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:15,999
how it looks and it just grew
from there

3568
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:17,999
and the guy just turned out to
be really

3569
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:19,999
smart he's never done any
political

3570
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,999
campaigns anything like that
and he just

3571
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:24,999
used calm in fact he did
everything that

3572
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:26,999
the political consultants in
Washington

3573
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:27,999
DC 

3574
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:29,999
he what they advised he did the
opposite

3575
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,999
did all kinds of different
innovative

3576
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:34,999
things and it's really
interesting to

3577
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:36,999
read his story now there's not
much in

3578
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,999
the way I mean every five so uh
while

3579
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:40,999
you were selecting a vendor's
for the

3580
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,999
website did any of them
possibly have

3581
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:48,999
ties to Russia like that

3582
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:50,999
so did they did they have speak
with an

3583
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,999
accent I mean this is the kind
of stuff

3584
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:57,999
that was going on and this has
worried a

3585
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:02,999
lot of people and the main
here's what's

3586
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:02,999
interesting 

3587
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:08,999
if flynn the case is dropped
and his his

3588
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:10,999
you know what he was accused of
was

3589
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:14,999
lying to the FBI and now it
turns out he

3590
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:16,999
was lying to the FBI because
the FBI

3591
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:17,999
said you better lie are we
gonna lock

3592
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:21,999
your kid up and the lie was a
very menu

3593
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,999
detail of a phone conversation
he had

3594
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:26,999
had with the Russian ambassador
kiss

3595
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,999
lyac and the feds when they were

3596
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:30,999
interviewing which I believe
include

3597
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:32,999
Peter struck they had already
heard the

3598
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:34,999
call they knew the answers to
the

3599
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,999
questions they were asking and
of course

3600
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:38,999
he answered something wrong
word said I

3601
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:40,999
don't remember that or I didn't
have

3602
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,999
this time and then they said
well you're

3603
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:45,999
gonna have to plead guilty here

3604
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:46,999
otherwise we're gonna get your
kid and

3605
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:48,999
he has a kid on the way and it
was it's

3606
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,999
really ugly really it's like J
ed ver

3607
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:58,999
edgar Hoover type style ugly
and the

3608
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:04,999
President Obama all of a sudden
has some

3609
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,999
coincidentally leaked audio

3610
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,999
that comes out in fact I have a
little

3611
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:12,999
news report about it because I
think

3612
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:14,999
what's happening is I believe
Obama as

3613
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:16,999
you pointed out Obama is
implicated in

3614
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,999
this thing it goes all the way
up to him

3615
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:21,999
and he's striking back but
interesting

3616
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:22,999
way he's doing it

3617
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,999
former President Obama
discussed the

3618
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:26,999
Michael Flint case during a
phone call

3619
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,999
with some former Obama
administration

3620
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:31,999
officials and then portions of
the audio

3621
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:33,999
of that call were leaked to
Yahoo News

3622
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:35,999
Flynn you may remember pled
guilty 'aa

3623
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:37,999
lying to the FBI about his

3624
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:38,999
communications with the Russia

3625
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:40,999
ambassador the Justice
Department

3626
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:42,999
announced Thursday it plans to
drop the

3627
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:44,999
case against the former national

3628
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:46,999
security advisor Obama says he
was

3629
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:56,999
shocked by the move where you

3630
02:40:57,000 --> 02:41:00,999
Norm's but our basic
understanding of

3631
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:09,999
rule of law is is it risk
President

3632
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:11,999
Trump praised the Justice
Department's

3633
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:13,999
decision he also praised Flynn
calling

3634
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:15,999
him an innocent man the White
House says

3635
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:17,999
it believes the FBI was trying
to target

3636
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,999
and trap Flynn over his
comments not

3637
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:22,999
surprisingly reaction up on
Capitol Hill

3638
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,999
has been split how I don't like
this

3639
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:27,999
report I think it's full of
crap they

3640
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:29,999
also left stuff out here's the
actual

3641
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:31,999
leaked call and there's
something that

3642
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:33,999
Obama said here which is
factually

3643
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:35,999
incorrect and I'm waiting for
the news

3644
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,999
media to let us know about that
the news

3645
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:42,999
over the last 24 hours I think
has been

3646
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:46,999
somewhat downplayed about the
Justice

3647
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,999
Department dropping charges
against

3648
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,999
Michael Flynn and the fact that
there is

3649
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:57,999
no precedent then anybody can
find for

3650
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,999
someone who's been charged with
perjury

3651
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:05,999
just getting off scot-free
interestingly

3652
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:10,999
he wasn't charged with perjury
that's

3653
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:11,999
just not true

3654
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,999
no he didn't take it Oh mercury
is very

3655
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,999
specific so why did Obama say
that why

3656
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:19,999
is he making a big deal out of
well this

3657
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,999
has never happened before a guy
perjured

3658
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,999
himself when he was no I think
Obama's a

3659
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:27,999
little a little we're a little
afraid

3660
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:29,999
it's getting a little hot under
the

3661
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:33,999
feets yeah I did sound you
think maybe

3662
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:34,999
Obama knew this was being
recorded how

3663
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:38,999
he leaps it was another piece of

3664
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:40,999
disinformation get thrown to
the pot

3665
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:42,999
this perjury nonsense told you
I see if

3666
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,999
anyone picks up the tree pit
flies yeah

3667
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:47,999
interesting well that shows
he's very

3668
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:49,999
when Obama has to step in and
do this

3669
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:55,999
kind of crap he's worried yeah
or

3670
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:57,999
something that's very strange
well I do

3671
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:01,999
have the super clips was this
is about

3672
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,999
the Flynn and this is a bunch
of clips

3673
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:06,999
that can't be right after Flynn
was

3674
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,999
first arrested indicted
whatever they

3675
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,999
want to call it the advertising
and all

3676
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:16,999
the media was and and Trump
knew this

3677
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:18,999
was a setup he bitched about he
said

3678
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:20,999
Clint shouldn't have been
arrested he's

3679
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:22,999
a great Patriot and on and on
and the

3680
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:24,999
White House and and the the
right the

3681
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:26,999
Conservatives all knew
something was

3682
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:28,999
fishy about this whole thing and

3683
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,999
meanwhile MSNBC and CNN and all
the rest

3684
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:33,999
of the news media they had their

3685
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:35,999
thoughts about it and they were
mocking

3686
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:37,999
everybody President Trump and
his top

3687
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,999
aides have been routinely
ignoring the

3688
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:44,999
truth and pushing phony
conspiracy

3689
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:46,999
theories the president it seems
to be

3690
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:48,999
saying that this was a case of

3691
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:50,999
entrapment that Michael Flynn
was

3692
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:52,999
essentially pressured into lying

3693
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:54,999
what is your response I think
that's

3694
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,999
hogwash you know there are all
kinds of

3695
02:43:58,000 --> 02:43:59,999
conspiracy theories about how
he was

3696
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:01,999
entrapped the FBI agents didn't
do

3697
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:03,999
anything wrong here so I think
that's

3698
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:04,999
important because there are a
lot of

3699
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:06,999
sort of conspiracy theories
they all

3700
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,999
work together and you know the
Fox News

3701
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:11,999
people in the White House fuel
these

3702
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:12,999
sort of rumors do they send
these around

3703
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:14,999
with fax machines they come up
with

3704
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:15,999
these conspiracy theories and
they send

3705
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,999
around the facts

3706
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:18,999
they should just knock it off
and

3707
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:20,999
realize that their ridiculous
conspiracy

3708
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:22,999
theories are gonna be knocked
down stop

3709
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:24,999
stop with the conspiracy
theories so I

3710
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:26,999
think that loud sound you heard
it about

3711
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,999
12:30 Eastern was the sound of
10000

3712
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:31,999
conspiracy theories by the Trump

3713
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:33,999
defenders exploding the sound
you hear

3714
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,999
is a million conspiracy theories

3715
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:37,999
exploding think I could call
them the

3716
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:39,999
trumpets all over the country
their

3717
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:41,999
heads were blown up here's
another

3718
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:43,999
conspiracy theory that has been
blown to

3719
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:45,999
bits Trump talking points and
right-wing

3720
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:49,999
media conspiracies demolished
poor

3721
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:50,999
Michael Flynn

3722
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,999
he was Duke it's so
embarrassing you

3723
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:55,999
know watch all your chips to
the middle

3724
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:57,999
of the table better be damn
sure you got

3725
02:44:58,000 --> 02:44:59,999
a good hand yeah the FBI broke
standard

3726
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,999
protocol in the way that they
came in an

3727
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:10,999
ambush general Flynn she knew
better

3728
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,999
yeah don't be no one cares what
they

3729
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,999
said two days ago think we know

3730
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,999
all wrong cares it's like fine

3731
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:21,999

the

3732
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:23,999

02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:35,999
blind people would be able to
work with

4008
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,999
things like jazz hands clapping
I'm so

4009
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,999
happy so glad that no agenda
isn't like

4010
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:42,999
other conservative shows where
they just

4011
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,999
do the opposite of the left
this is true

4012
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:47,999
well we're also not a
conservative

4013
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,999
shiranai conservative show but
but Devin

4014
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:52,999

seventh we

4019
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:11,999
have we have more blind
listeners than

4020
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:16,999

little

4174
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:39,999
taken aback with the the
support for the

4175
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:41,999
moms this has never happened on
the show

4176
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:42,999
before never

4177
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,999
uou I got it I got it figured
it out I

4178
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:47,999
know okay what do you think
Kovach yes I

4179
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:50,999
agree I think that during this
time is

4180
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:52,999
when people are looking around
at their

4181
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,999
household and going holy crap
she does

4182
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:57,999
all that that's what's going
I'm telling

4183
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:00,999
you that's what's going on yeah
that's

4184
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:02,999
what's going on and it's likely
because

4185
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:04,999
this is the worst show of one
of the

4186
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:06,999

about that yeah well should we
do that

4308
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:57,999
now and at last but let's do
that last

4309
03:12:58,000 --> 03:13:00,999
it's not as good as her other
slams in

4310
03:13:01,000 --> 03:13:02,999
the past but it's just a
similar style

4311
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:04,999
and I'm liking the way she's
doing these

4312
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:08,999
things a lot of people like her
then I

4313
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:10,999
get to bite and came out and it
looks

4314
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:12,999
like it came out of the
basement oh okay

4315
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:15,999
this is goodnight a special
special I

4316
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:17,999
don't know why the meet out
personal way

4317
03:13:18,000 --> 03:13:19,999
it was this was this yet another

4318
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:23,999
technological abortion no it was

4319
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:23,999
actually pretty good

4320
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:26,999
I heard that he won didn't do
it well

4321
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:28,999
and it was like Joe Biden live
and his

4322
03:13:29,000 --> 03:13:30,999
lunch life was like in quotes
it was

4323
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:36,999
like you know so he's he comes
out with

4324
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:38,999
with a stupid mask on looks
like an

4325
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:40,999
idiot and I think he's in his
back in

4326
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:42,999
his in his basement with a guy
and I

4327
03:13:43,000 --> 03:13:43,999
don't think he's there's a book
she'll

4328
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:45,999
see I'm I think it's a green
screen I

4329
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:46,999
think they just changed the set
you have

4330
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:50,999
them standing that's what I
think I

4331
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:51,999
don't think he was because I
don't know

4332
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:52,999
that he's got this background
and then

4333
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:54,999
if you listen carefully I'm
gonna play

4334
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:57,999
two clips this is the first
one's a bit

4335
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:02,999
of Biden you play that oops

4336
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:05,999
being here is pacing oh my
sorry it just

4337
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:08,999
affects there we go it has so
far cost

4338
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:10,999
tens of thousand Americans
lives and

4339
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:13,999
millions of the jobs and make
no mistake

4340
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:15,999
it doesn't matter how much the
market

4341
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:17,999
rebounds as long as there are
millions

4342
03:14:18,000 --> 03:14:20,999
of unemployed struggling people
to get

4343
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:22,999
by we won't be anywhere near
bouncing

4344
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:23,999
back 

4345
03:14:24,000 --> 03:14:27,999
[Applause] 

4346
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:32,999
haha that sounded really dumb
we yeah as

4347
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:34,999
long as millions of people
struggling to

4348
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:36,999
get by it's great that's
basically what

4349
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:37,999
he's saying as long as there are

4350
03:14:38,000 --> 03:14:40,999
millions of unemployed
struggling people

4351
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:42,999
to get by we won't be anywhere
near

4352
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:46,999
bouncing back yeah what he
meant was

4353
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:49,999
people struggling to get by but
okay

4354
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:51,999
second his entire economic
strategy is

4355
03:14:52,000 --> 03:14:54,999
focused on helping the wealthy
and big

4356
03:14:55,000 --> 03:14:57,999
corporations just imagine just
imagine

4357
03:14:58,000 --> 03:15:00,999
what we could be doing now with
the 2

4358
03:15:01,000 --> 03:15:02,999
trillion dollars in tax cuts
Trump

4359
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:04,999
delivered to his rich friends
as this

4360
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:07,999
first priority amazes how much
better a

4361
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:09,999
position we be in right now

4362
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:11,999
struck if instead of Donald
Trump

4363
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:13,999
cheering corporations on that
spend

4364
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:15,999
hundreds of billions of dollars
buying

4365
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:18,999
back their own stock these
corporations

4366
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:20,999
have I'm guessing that money to
keep

4367
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:22,999
workers on their payroll okay
all right

4368
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:25,999
this is this is insulting to my

4369
03:15:26,000 --> 03:15:28,999
intelligence the Democrat Party
who with

4370
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:30,999
the Republicans voted
unanimously for

4371
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:34,999
this bill for the cares Act
which he's

4372
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:35,999
not tell about the cares Act
what's he

4373
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:37,999
talking about then he's talking
about

4374
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:40,999
that tax cut that went into
play in 2017

4375
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:43,999
the two trillion dollars well
he's got

4376
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:46,999
his numbers a little mixed up
cuz that's

4377
03:15:47,000 --> 03:15:48,999
not what it was he does have
his numbers

4378
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:51,999
little mixed up well anyway he
goes on

4379
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:53,999
visit next part of it but it
doing just

4380
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:54,999
that they did produce us a
little bit

4381
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:56,999
because they have and I you
notice this

4382
03:15:57,000 --> 03:15:59,999
in the first clip too but
notice it more

4383
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:01,999
I heard birds in the background
that's

4384
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:02,999
what I'm saying

4385
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:05,999
they got phony birds chirping
in the

4386
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:07,999
background is on the brother
greens

4387
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:09,999
there's no way you'd have to
mic the

4388
03:16:10,000 --> 03:16:13,999
birds and come on hey wait a
minute you

4389
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:15,999
sure the windows not open it
could be

4390
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:17,999
the real birds Joe Biden they
can't even

4391
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:19,999
record Joe Biden property let
alone some

4392
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:21,999
birds in the background but it
could be

4393
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:24,999
yes sure okay

4394
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:26,999
please done now he really goes
after

4395
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:28,999
Trump everything's Trump's
fault of

4396
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:29,999
course it is well he has blood
on his

4397
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:30,999
hands 

4398
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:32,999
you know Koba 19 caused massive
economic

4399
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:35,999
challenges but this crisis hit
harder

4400
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:38,999
and will last longer because
Donald

4401
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:40,999
spent the last three years
undermining

4402
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:42,999
the core pillars of our economic

4403
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:45,999
strength many small businesses
closed

4404
03:16:46,000 --> 03:16:47,999
because stayed home or because
of

4405
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:50,999
stay-at-home orders but a lot
of them

4406
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:52,999
won't open again because they
don't have

4407
03:16:53,000 --> 03:16:55,999
a cushion due to three years of
Trump's

4408
03:16:56,000 --> 03:16:57,999
policies that rewarded the
biggest

4409
03:16:58,000 --> 03:17:00,999
companies yes many have lost
their jobs

4410
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:02,999
because of the crisis or we're
seeing

4411
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:05,999
many proud families forced to
endure

4412
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:07,999
epic lines for food boxes in
football

4413
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:10,999
stadium parking lots because
Donald

4414
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:12,999
Trump has spent three years
tilting the

4415
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:14,999
playing field toward the
wealthy and not

4416
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:15,999
the middle-class

4417
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:18,999
you know Trump love to crow
about the

4418
03:17:19,000 --> 03:17:20,999
great economy he villains but
when the

4419
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:23,999
crisis hit became clear who the
economy

4420
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:25,999
had built this was built to
serve not

4421
03:17:26,000 --> 03:17:27,999
workers not the middle class not

4422
03:17:28,000 --> 03:17:30,999
families Trump's economic
agenda has

4423
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:33,999
three unmistakable failings
failings

4424
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:36,999
that have been present since
day one but

4425
03:17:37,000 --> 03:17:37,999
are coming into sharp relief in
the

4426
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:41,999
current crisis first Donald
Trump's main

4427
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:43,999
measures main measure of
economic

4428
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:44,999
progress is the state of the
stock

4429
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:47,999
market it's the only metric he
values

4430
03:17:48,000 --> 03:17:49,999
and it's the only lens through
which he

4431
03:17:50,000 --> 03:17:51,999
sees our economy for the past
three

4432
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:54,999
years even as Americans have
had to work

4433
03:17:55,000 --> 03:17:56,999
harder than ever to pay their
bills

4434
03:17:57,000 --> 03:17:59,999
he said the economy was great
because

4435
03:18:00,000 --> 03:18:02,999
the stock market was up hey
this is

4436
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:07,999
pretty insulting it really is
yeah I do

4437
03:18:08,000 --> 03:18:09,999
but I heard a different bird
when I

4438
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:11,999
listened to Joe Biden this is
the berta

4439
03:18:12,000 --> 03:18:21,999
here it's it's gosh man instead
of

4440
03:18:22,000 --> 03:18:24,999
saying here's what I'm going to
do no

4441
03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:26,999
this is all he's got so that he
has

4442
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:28,999
nothing that's got nothing you
can't

4443
03:18:29,000 --> 03:18:31,999
just lean this before you can't
just run

4444
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:34,999
on I hate Trump no that's
probably why

4445
03:18:35,000 --> 03:18:37,999
Hillary lost exactly above all
other

4446
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:39,999
things I mean she could have
won easily

4447
03:18:40,000 --> 03:18:41,999
but just con she had no plans
it was

4448
03:18:42,000 --> 03:18:43,999
just all this guy sucks yeah
this guy

4449
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:46,999

rid of

4453
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:54,999
him that's exactly right

4454
03:18:55,000 --> 03:18:56,999
is exactly what's happening
here nothing

4455
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:58,999
going on and then last on my
list of

4456
03:18:59,000 --> 03:19:00,999
clips I do have Kaylee and this
is going

03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:02,999

4458
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:04,999
some of these quotes that were
from the

4459
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:06,999
released papers and she was
thinking

4460
03:19:07,000 --> 03:19:07,999
that's great I'm sure she's
gonna have

4461
03:19:08,000 --> 03:19:09,999
more about their real this is
Kaylee

4462
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:11,999
mackaninee who is the new girl
on the

4463
03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:14,999
block she is putting up quite a
fight

4464
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:17,999
against against the Washington
press

4465
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:19,999
corps I I am sorry I thought she

4466
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:21,999
wouldn't last a week but she is
there

4467
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:24,999
and she's hanging in she's a
tough

4468
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:40,999
made-up cookie it simply glad
you asked

4469
03:19:41,000 --> 03:19:43,999
that because for about first
four weeks

4470
03:19:44,000 --> 03:19:47,999
of the election I was watching
CNN and I

4471
03:19:48,000 --> 03:19:49,999
was naively believing some of
the

4472
03:19:50,000 --> 03:19:55,999
headlines that I saw I'm
actually not

4473
03:19:56,000 --> 03:19:57,999
going to read the headlines so
I very

4474
03:19:58,000 --> 03:19:59,999
quickly came around supported
the

4475
03:20:00,000 --> 03:20:01,999
president in fact CNN hired me
I was on

4476
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:04,999
many eight on one panels where
I proudly

4477
03:20:05,000 --> 03:20:06,999
supported this president who I
believe

4478
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:08,999
is one of the best presidents
it's not

4479
03:20:09,000 --> 03:20:09,999
the best president this country
will

4480
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:12,999
ever have but I would encourage
the

4481
03:20:13,000 --> 03:20:14,999
individual who did that
analysis of my

4482
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:17,999
past rather than focusing on me
he

4483
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:19,999
really should be focused on
some of the

4484
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:21,999
very guests CNN chose to have
on their

4485
03:20:22,000 --> 03:20:23,999
network he should be focused on
I mean

4486
03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:25,999
my over here Jim Jim clapper
who said

4487
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:28,999
you know ten days before he
privately

4488
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:29,999
told investigators there was no
evidence

4489
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:32,999
of collusion that Watergate
pales in

4490
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:34,999
comparison to the Russia probe
I'd

4491
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:36,999
encourage them to look at
Samantha

4492
03:20:37,000 --> 03:20:38,999
Power's who was privately
saying I'm not

4493
03:20:39,000 --> 03:20:39,999
in possession of any evidence of

4494
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:42,999
collusion ambassador rice I
don't recall

4495
03:20:43,000 --> 03:20:44,999
intelligence or evidence of any

4496
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:46,999
collusion former attorney
general

4497
03:20:47,000 --> 03:20:48,999
Loretta Lynch I do not recall
that being

4498
03:20:49,000 --> 03:20:51,999
briefed to me and for three
years two

4499
03:20:52,000 --> 03:20:53,999
years probably more than that
CNN ran

4500
03:20:54,000 --> 03:20:55,999
with the collusion narrative
and if the

4501
03:20:56,000 --> 03:20:57,999
American people are watching
right now

4502
03:20:58,000 --> 03:20:58,999
they're probably very confused
as to

4503
03:20:59,000 --> 03:20:59,999
some of the

4504
03:21:00,000 --> 03:21:01,999
I read those individuals were
saying

4505
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:03,999
much different things publicly
than they

4506
03:21:04,000 --> 03:21:05,999
were saying privately and I'm
very

4507
03:21:06,000 --> 03:21:06,999
grateful that those transcripts
were

4508
03:21:07,000 --> 03:21:08,999
released yesterday and perhaps
the Kay

4509
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:15,999
file should do an analysis of
that

4510
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:18,999
president there is no
questioning that

4511
03:21:19,000 --> 03:21:20,999
so honored to work for him and
ebony

4512
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:23,999
next question

4513
03:21:24,000 --> 03:21:26,999

03:21:27,000 --> 03:21:28,999

reporting

4515
03:21:29,000 --> 03:21:31,999
is she only interested in
making Caylee

4516
03:21:32,000 --> 03:21:33,999
look stupid is that what
they're doing

4517
03:21:34,000 --> 03:21:36,999
what a waste of time they're
not getting

4518
03:21:37,000 --> 03:21:40,999
very far it's like a huff x
mark mean

4519
03:21:41,000 --> 03:21:43,999
girl does that wouldn't touch
her she's

4520
03:21:44,000 --> 03:21:46,999

03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:48,999
