00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,950
Adam Curry: So we had to
speaking of Eclipse we had the

21
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,710
Eclipse yesterday. Yeah, we had

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,500
John C Dvorak: it too, though.
You had it too. Oh, yeah. We had

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,490
the was the 95% It wasn't full
like yours down there. But, boy,

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,340
I know your show isn't quite
100% full but you got one coming

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,430
in April. That's 100% And it's
gonna be in Texas. Yes.

26
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,660
Adam Curry: Yes. The 1% 100%
Well, the one yesterday was a

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,310
was judgeship was a total Jip

28
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,070
John C Dvorak: wasn't cool. No,
no, it wasn't cool. You know

29
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,910
what Chip is?

30
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,000
Adam Curry: Now we gotta we
gotta Ring of Fire. Okay, now,

31
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,080
that arc was what what, what,
what? What are you What are you

32
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,700
hiding from, but we had

33
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,860
John C Dvorak: cloud cover
through a bunch of fog. You got

34
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,290
to read it not only didn't get
dark, you wouldn't know it

35
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,400
didn't even happened.

36
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,599
Adam Curry: So Fredericksburg
was full. It wasn't like what we

37
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,529
expect for the full eclipse in
April. But it was full. And I

38
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:03,599
know it was full because we had
dinner with some new friends.

39
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:08,429
Remember, I told you I had my
birthday dinner? And this guy

40
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,259
bought us bought our dinner?

41
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,190
John C Dvorak: Yeah, the guy
from across the room. It won't

42
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,610
get Yeah.

43
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,350
Adam Curry: Oh, yeah. Anyway, so
they had they he has a ranch

44
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,170
like in Midland or something.
And he lives in Austin, but they

45
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,010
always come to Fredericksburg on
their way to the ranch. And, and

46
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,340
that's how we how we met them.
And they could they had to stay

47
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,890
at the Comfort Inn and we're
lucky to get a comfort in room,

48
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,360
which is almost a step below
LaQuinta everything was full,

49
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,270
but it wasn't over full crazy.
And you know, but people all I

50
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:42,570
ever do

51
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,420
Unknown: all. Ah ha. Ah,

52
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,150
Adam Curry: I just don't get it.
Why are people so fascinated by

53
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,400
it? By the Eclipse? What is it
that

54
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,520
John C Dvorak: the knives I've
seen a couple of them? I've seen

55
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,970
a lot of debate boys, and moon
and sun. And I did fun. It's

56
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,250
interesting. It was always
interesting. When you have a

57
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,310
full Eclipse, it actually
literally gets about 10 degrees

58
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,730
colder. Right on the spot. Yeah,
that didn't happen yesterday,

59
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,090
either. No, it didn't happen
here either. But normally, you

60
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,390
get this and as you can feel
it's like Oh, and by the way,

61
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,000
when that happens when everyone
out there gets to experience

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,520
this, like 10 degree drop in
temperature when the sun gets

63
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,540
fullest Eclipse for just a few
seconds. Thank yourself. Ah, the

64
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,120
sun has nothing to do with
global warming.

65
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,880
Adam Curry: Sure. Okay, well
speaking of that. So this new

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,510
friend, we're gonna call him
Paul, the tycoon oil tycoon.

67
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,710
John C Dvorak: So we had this
new friend of yours, it has to

68
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,910
be named in code.

69
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,430
Adam Curry: B, I haven't
discussed with him yet. And I

70
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,560
don't want to ruin my new
friendship just yet. So he had a

71
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,010
very successful Oil Company,
which he took public, and then

72
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,620
they sold it. And then he had a
year that he couldn't do

73
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,440
anything. They started a new
one. So it was no new oil

74
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,900
companies worth one and a half
billion dollars. You wouldn't

75
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,480
know looking at the guy. So this
is like, Oh, how interesting.

76
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,070
John C Dvorak: Texas
billionaires. They're all like

77
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,240
that. Yeah, exactly.

78
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,940
Adam Curry: And it's real. Like
he's a guy that has, you know,

79
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:24,240
like drills on the ground and
oil comes out. Yes. He's not a

80
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,320
wildcatter.

81
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,200
John C Dvorak: So wildcatters
wildcatter.

82
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,760
Adam Curry: And he says, and so
we're, you know, we're yapping

83
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,040
away and ESG comes up, he says,
ah, oh, gotta tell you about ESG

84
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,520
All right, says Guess who the
and this company is not yet

85
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,530
public. Guess what the number
one investor is in my in my my

86
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,910
company my oil spurting out of
the ground company. You get one

87
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,450
guest jump

88
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,370
John C Dvorak: I wouldn't have a
clue of what who to guess. I

89
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,680
mean, yeah. Microsoft I mean, I
don't know

90
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,750
Adam Curry: No, no. Did you talk
by in the troll room got it

91
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,020
right right off the bat,
BlackRock, BlackRock,

92
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,510
John C Dvorak: 50, blank row.
They're interested in everything

93
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,590
and it will count down, but

94
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,480
Adam Curry: they're the guys who
started the ESG program. This is

95
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,750
This is Larry Fink's baby. And
it's like all we owe, you know,

96
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,810
if you're, if you don't have a
high ESG score, then you're on

97
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,560
investable. And so he explained
the mechanics, he said, he

98
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,560
backed off on it, by the way
recently, yeah, a little bit,

99
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,910
but the ESG score hasn't gone
away. And if you have a low and

100
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,610
environmental, social government
governance, if you don't have

101
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:35,730
oh,

102
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,970
John C Dvorak: yeah, he's an oil
company. You should be low

103
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,780
score, you should

104
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,920
Adam Curry: be zero negative
score. So 50 million already in

105
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,940
another 50 million coming from
BlackRock. And my new friend

106
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:54,090
Paul, the oil tycoon says, the
ESG is phenomenal. It's great.

107
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,290
Because whenever they tell us
all bow climate change,

108
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,520
whatever, you got to close it,
well, boom, price goes up, we

109
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,080
make out like bandits. He says
it's a whole the whole thing.

110
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,210
It's a scam. He says when we had
the public company, it was

111
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,480
phenomenal. Oh, boy, we have to
close it well, oh, it's a

112
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,360
problem. Boom, stock price
rockets. To this whole thing is

113
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,380
a scapegoat. When

114
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,160
John C Dvorak: I look at the
evidence of this, take a look at

115
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:34,020
the chart for Exxon. And first
look at where Joe Biden was

116
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,750
elected and look at the stock
price then and look at it. He

117
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,530
also said

118
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,680
Adam Curry: specifically, he
says look, I don't like it for

119
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,130
our country in the world. But
Democrats are good for business

120
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:49,200
use. Whenever a Democrat in the
White House is good for us.

121
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,140
John C Dvorak: Tell it tell it
to the 90s that's when Clinton

122
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,460
was in Iraq and

123
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,650
Adam Curry: yeah, why don't you
soak in that for a bit? I love

124
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:03,270
saying that marinate in that
once you put that in your pipe

125
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,380
and smoke it I don't know about
you but there's nothing but

126
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,390

disinformation so all
disinformation everywhere.

128
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,890

suspending some of the accounts
after they were contacted by NBC

00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,950
News but didn't otherwise have
any comment. It's something

167
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,170
we've seen a lot of over the
past few days. Oh, yeah.

168
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,480
Militants started a new
airstrike on Israel. You see

169
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,210
that? That's that video that is
actually from a video game. No,

170
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,030

conclusion to what they're doing

173
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,010
here. You and you know what's
coming.

174
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,230
Unknown: And there was this post
claiming Israel bombed and

175
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,260
destroyed an old Greek Orthodox
Church in Gaza. It has something

176
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,730
like 3 million views.

177
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,920
Adam Curry: It has something
like 3 million. What kind of

178
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,260
news report is that? And how
many views that it have not

179
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,090
something like that's something
like

180
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,100
John C Dvorak: $3 million. The
number is right there. You can

181
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,460
read it.

182
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,980
Adam Curry: Now she sounded like
a high school girl. It's

183
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,500
something that had something
like 3000 3 Million Likes now.

184

Unknown: And there was this post
claiming Israel bombed and

185

destroyed an old Greek Orthodox
Church in Gaza. It has something

186
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,080
like 3 million views, but the
church itself said it hasn't

187
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,550
been touched that any other news
is false. Now have disclaimers

188
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,980
on the bottom if you go to F and
look at the posts, but they're

189
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,980
not taken down and some of them
are posted from verified users,

190
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,980
making it harder for people to
know what's real. NBC News tech

191
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,710
correspondent Jake Ward Joining
us now and Jake these are just a

192
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,770
couple of examples of this these
posts containing misinformation

193
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,400
disinformation very difficult
especially in a moment like this

194
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,340
when people are frankly
desperate for information

195
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,710
turning to social media
platforms just there's not a

196
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,690
clear cut picture that
desperately is

197
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,830
not a clear cut picture Holly
the past few days, this vivid

198
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,590
lesson in the fact that you
literally cannot trust what

199
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:28,230
social media is. Even more
difficult is the surprise turn

200
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,200
of events which means that
legitimate sources of

201
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,930
information are slow to react
because they were taking just as

202
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,220
surprised as so many people were
across Israel. So a very, very

203
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,150
difficult moment but as you look
for raishin of of misleading

204
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,480
content, and when it's not just
made up as in the case of the

205
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,840
video game clip you're showing
there a middle it's out of

206
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,370
context or out of time Oh, it
trust us legitimate sources.

207
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,910
It's even hard for us people
trust legitimate sources.

208
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:02,340
John C Dvorak: And when you're
going on this route, because I

209
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:10,410
have a series of misleading
clips from provided by PBS I

210
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:15,750
love that which is beyond like
misinformation. It's a it's a

211
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,890
it's a lie.

212
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,880
Adam Curry: Well, let me set it
up. Let

213
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,950
John C Dvorak: me set it up with
keep no I want to hear more of

214
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:20,280
this.

215
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,860
Adam Curry: Yeah, another
misinformation clip. This is

216
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,210
from CBS a term fake

217
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,290
Unknown: news is a controversial
one controversial. It's often

218
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,020
used to falsely claim that the
facts someone doesn't like or

219
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,310
just made up. But actual fake
news takes on a new tone when

220
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,030
it's used as a weapon of war
when misinformation has already

221
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,910
cropped up in abundance in the
current conflict in the Middle

222
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,700
East. Jolene Kent has the story

223
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,160
Adam Curry: you see a similarity
here the M five and what they're

224
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,610
saying.

225
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,520
Unknown: Oh, as the wound was
real in Gaza

226
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,680
good start

227
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,310
John C Dvorak: there trying to
use misinformation and a random

228
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,960
explosion Yeah, how

229
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,360
Adam Curry: should we start this
report about misinformation? I

230
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,430
don't know blow something up.
Good one

231
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:05,699
Unknown: as the war in Israel in
Gaza plays out in real time on

232
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:09,629
social media. Experts say bad
information and propaganda are

233
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:12,599
spreading on X formally, Twitter
Oh,

234
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,510
Adam Curry: it's x again.
Formerly known as Twitter I

235
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,190
there's a pattern here it's
group

236
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,490
Unknown: aleafia detected a
network of at least 67 accounts

00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,630
that posted false content about
the war faulty Russians millions

238
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:30,270
of views by now. excluding these
mistranslated videos of Russian

239
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,810
President Vladimir Putin and
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov,

240
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,590
you manipulated to falsely say
that Russia will support

241
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:43,050
Palestine if the US supports
Israel. Why are 67 accounts so

242
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,230
powerful in their influence? And
why do they not

243
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,270
Adam Curry: know they are? No
they are they're very powerful.

244
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,330
This is Elon his home business
model is now being attacked.

245
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,310
This is this is the point of
this

246
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,250
Unknown: and why do they matter?
It matters whether or not people

247
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,610
believe that and the more times
that people are able to view

248
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:04,680
content of a similarly, the more
opportunities an actor has to

249
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,680
convince somebody of something
that may or may not be for

250
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,500
Adam Curry: an actor George
Clooney was doing this. What

251
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,540
actor actor Brad Pitt This

252
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,930
Unknown: comes after Elon Musk,
the owner of X laid off much of

253
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:22,050
the team responsible for
monitoring. The European Union

254
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,750
sent this letter to the
billionaire asking Musk to

255
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,990
immediately remove illegal
content and disinformation.

256
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,750
Adam Curry: My name is God but
at all I have a habit bug it in

257
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,200
my book.

258
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,440
Unknown: Otherwise, penalties
can be imposed. How does this

259
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,550
disinformation impact the war?
And what we know about it

260
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,890
when we flood people with this
sea of unvetted information,

261
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,190
much of it deceptive, is we're
throwing away the goodwill of

262
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:51,750
our citizens. And we're opening
the door to a variety of people

263
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,520
that want to manipulate their
goodwill.

264
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,270
Do you anticipate seeing more of
this kind of activity as the war

265
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,320
continues? Oh, yes,

266
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,490
Adam Curry: of course. Yes.

267
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,910
Unknown: We do anticipate that
in the coming days that this

268
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,990
information sphere is going to
get updated and that more actors

269
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,820
will be weaponizing information.

270
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,030
Adam Curry: More and more
actors.

271
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,490
Unknown: What our history as

272
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,400
Adam Curry: she did it again,
did she just do again x formerly

273
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,030
known Twitter

274
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,330
Unknown: X. Formerly Twitter has
said as of Monday, they've

275
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,360
already removed several 100
accounts, including those that

276
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,240
are Hamas affiliated. Meantime,
we've been pressing the other

277
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,900
social media companies about
this. And Snapchat, Tik Tok and

278
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,660
Facebook all say they've
increased their resources to

279
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,070
fight disinformation.

280
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,270
John C Dvorak: Oh, please.

281
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,670
Adam Curry: So before, before we
get to your clips, I'm very

282
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,030
interested in those two things.
One, this is confirmed all right

283
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,360
now I don't have I don't have to
have the TIC tock app. People

284
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,450
send me tic TOCs all the time
and I open them in the browser.

285
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,350
And so what I do then every
single time after that tick tock

286
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:58,590
is done that one video, the
same. Horrific, violent clip

287
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:04,440
pops up from some Israeli kid
being killed at the at the at

288
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,080
the at the rave and my my buddy
Dave

289
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,490
John C Dvorak: he says it must
be your cookies

290
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:13,770
Adam Curry: no he didn't get it
well okay but I'm two people in

291
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:18,150
two different states are seeing
the same thing so I there's

292
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,460
those misinformation different
from from different from

293
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,790
Michigan now before we get
before we get into it before we

294
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,700
go any further with this talking
about this conflict what's

295
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,960
happening in the Middle East

296
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,010
John C Dvorak: Adams gonna read
his email by area fine there's

297
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:32,640
the old clip

298
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,940
Adam Curry: it's called a
cigales from the gym

299
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,330
Unknown: who's gonna read his
email

300
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:47,310
Adam Curry: on the no agenda.
That's not tedious. I want to

301
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:52,560
remind everybody that when we
deconstruct these things, same

302
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,340
with COVID lockdowns you,
Ukraine. It is it is masks, it

303
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:05,460
is bad for business. It is not a
great business model that we

304
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,410
have. It's not like people go
oh, yeah, this is great. No,

305
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,770
people walk away from the show.
They go,

306
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,650
John C Dvorak: Oh, I've been I
bought in hook line and sinker

307
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,530
and they're telling me I'm
wrong. You guys suck.

308
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,630
Adam Curry: I has been listening
to your show no agenda for two

309
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,180
to four years. That's Wait, wait

310
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,260
John C Dvorak: two to four
years.

311
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,350
Adam Curry: That's an interest.
Very interesting range. Never

312
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:37,350
heard to two to four years and
I've always enjoyed it. However,

313
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:42,390
your coverage of the atrocities
by the monstrous Hamas,

314
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,860
including the beheading of
innocent babies, babies torn

315
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:53,670
from their mother's bellies is
so appalling. So I, I don't

316
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:57,780
recall babies torn from their
mother's bellies to new one.

317
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,430
There is indeed ample footage
pictures to prove what happened.

318
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,890
And your glib laughter was one
your glib laughter with John,

319
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:12,150
well, there are no words, you're
excused that you're just

320
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,040
evaluating the media coverage is
cheap, and not even believable.

321
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,830
To say I'm disappointed and
disgusted would be an

322
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,270
understatement.

323
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,300
John C Dvorak: I want to remind
people out there who have these

324
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,750
kinds of complaints, send them
to Adam because he'll read him

325
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,620
on the air.

326
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,570
Adam Curry: You know, it's it's
taken on a whole new level, you

327
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,680
know, the mid curry.com. You
know, the, you know, that dude

328
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,520
who was so mad about when we
started talking about trans

329
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,420
Maoism.

330
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,330
John C Dvorak: Tim Poole now?
No,

331
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,880
Adam Curry: I iron iron hide.
1970 Mike Ironhide 1972 He was

332
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,330
it was he was putting pictures
up on Norwegian art generator

333
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,610
that we suck. It was your post?
Oh,

334
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,290
John C Dvorak: yeah, we I think
we bounced him that way.

335
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,850
Adam Curry: I died. I mean,
Paul, pocket two are bouncing

336
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,570
from that. But they showed up in
the troll room last show. So now

337
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:12,840
I get an email from one of our
producers who happens to also

338
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,670
own the venue where he's
organizing the a meet up. It's a

339
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:22,080
burger joint. And the email he
received which I'm sure many

340
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,910
John C Dvorak: the hater, you're
talking about organizing a

341
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,930
meeting? No, no, no, no.

342
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,170
Adam Curry: One of our producers
who's organizing a meetup who

343
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,130
organizes one regularly who has
a venue he owns the venue in

344
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,180
this case, as the venue owner,
he received an email from the

345
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,710
hater. Okay, letting you know
that a group from the no agenda

346
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,910
podcast will be at your
establishment on October 14 at

347
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,950
5pm this group follows a very
homophobic and transphobic

348
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,300
podcast. I would use all caution
when serving these people.

349
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,900
John C Dvorak: Wow.

350
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,070
Adam Curry: That was a good wow.
That was a very good wow,

351
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,650
John C Dvorak: that's a very
good while because that's a wow

352
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,490
moment. Yeah, so this prick
that's calm where he is.

353
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,220
Besides, he doesn't like to show
for whatever reason. Oh, noes

354
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,720
are after the venue for the
meetup. But coincidentally, the

355
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,450
venue is owned by the guy
organizing the meetup. So he

356
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,890
sends the mail right on to us,
which you just read. That is

357
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:30,780
unbelievable. That guy is a true
a whole I wish these people

358
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,850
wouldn't even listen to the
show. They get better things to

359
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,630
do. There's other shows that can
go to well, this I harass us,

360
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,050
because they're white trying to
ruin a good meet up. I mean,

361
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,760
come on. That's sick. I actually

362
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,860
Adam Curry: tried to talk him
off the ledge when this first

363
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,530
started and I was emailing him
personally and then he decided

364
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,220
that the prick Yeah, then he
then he published all my emails.

365
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:56,040
I'm like, Dude, I pray for him.
I go, I forgive him. I forgive

366
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,430
him. He has issues I forgive
him. I hope it works out for

367
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:05,070
him. All right now won't now on
to your your disinfo clips from

368
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,510
NPR which I'm very excited for
PBS it was our I'm sorry I mean

369
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,580
NPR PBS I mean

370
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,710
John C Dvorak: yeah what diverse
is a second let's

371
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,700
Adam Curry: do it let's do it
right

372
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:22,110
Unknown: elitist voices of
America this is NPR or PBS

373
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,550
Adam Curry: doesn't matter

374
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,000
John C Dvorak: so a couple of
these I got some intro ones that

375
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,440
we can go into which is the
Brooks and K part.

376
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,140
Adam Curry: Oh Mike you know,
I'm gonna have to start banning

377
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,740
these these these clips because
I'll blame me Oh, but nobody

378
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,030
watches this anymore. They have
zero traction. They don't they

379
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,650
still think it's Brooks and Dunn

380
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,750
Unknown: never was Brooks.

381
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:53,250
Adam Curry: That's a country
duo. What's what's Brooks

382
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,900
John C Dvorak: Garth Brooks?
What's the other guy? A key part

383
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,040
before before

384
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,640
Adam Curry: before K part who
was at the shields? Oh, Brooks

385
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,920
and shields see we don't even
remember the old guys

386
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,820
John C Dvorak: I remember.

387
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,330
Adam Curry: Oh, okay. Okay some
point all right, let's go but

388
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:09,660
what are we

389
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,560
John C Dvorak: examples I'm
gonna lead into the into the to

390
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:19,620
the egregious re edited clip.
I'm sorry. They used to become a

391
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,490
gassed and pissed off. And it's
ridiculous. But let's firstly

392
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,610
get us in the mood by listening
to these two boneheads in the

393
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,510
mood in the mood. This is start
I'm gonna start with Brooks

394
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,650
Putin Hamas.

395
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,860
Unknown: For I thought this was
one of Joe Biden's best weeks as

396
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,100
president. You know, he was a
was a moral clarity.

397
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,970
Adam Curry: That's great. Right
there. He's better. He said,

398
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:45,390
Hey, I've seen proof of the
babies decapitated. It's true.

399
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,090
It's right. It's certified
verify? Oh, I'm sorry. No, the

400
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,290
President was confused.

401
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,320
Unknown: He was one of the early
voices to remind everybody that

402
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,560
what Hamas has become looks like
ISIS sort of a death cult. He

403
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,410
did in the face of divisions on
the left. There are a lot of

404
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,840
mainstream liberals who are
appalled by what happened there

405
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,140
more progressive voices, many
who think this is a legitimate

406
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,560
part of decolonization. And
yeah, Joe Biden has knows

407
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,170
Israeli history. He knows the
Palestinians. He's been doing

408
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:14,040
this for a long time. And he
knows that this is a case of

409
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,650
someone who wants to have a
group that wants to destroy

410
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:21,180
Israel and push the Jews into
the sea. And so he said that it

411
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,730
is also making the case which I
think Solinsky is a little ahead

412
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:28,020
of him on Ukraine and Israel,
the Morgans Tomas and against

413
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,260
Putin are joined their wars
against barbarism.

414
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,820
Adam Curry: What? Yeah. What did
he say

415
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,450
John C Dvorak: that Putin in
Hamas are the same? Ukraine and

416
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:46,110
Israel is the same. Wow. Wow.
Okay. Yeah.

417
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,980
Adam Curry: It's the same. It's
the same except the reverse, but

418
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,530
John C Dvorak: we can't actually
say it's the same. It's the same

419
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,220
Hello. So

420
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,740
Adam Curry: you have a big
country like Russia is just like

421
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,510
Hamas? The big country and the
big country, the big the big

422
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,870
elephant in the fight? Okay. All
right. Okay, good.

423
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,820
John C Dvorak: Let's go Brooks
to K part two.

424
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,510
Unknown: And I think he sees
that clearly. And so I just

425
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,970
think it was it was just a
marvelous display, moral

426
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,750
clarity, and real storytelling.
For a guy who stories grand

427
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,330
narrative storytelling, and
rhetoric is not always the great

428
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,160
gift, but I just thought
magnificent

429
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,500
moral clarity and grand
storytelling. What's your

430
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,090
assessment of the
administration's response?

431
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:29,670
I agree with with David 100%.
President, it's the Secretary of

432
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:35,940
State who spoke from the heart
next to Prime Minister Netanyahu

433
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,320
and Secretary of Defense Lloyd
Austin being there earlier in

434
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,200
the day today also showing
solidarity but i What happened a

435
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:52,170
week ago, tonight or tomorrow is
really it's beyond disturbing.

436
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:57,570
And I I just feel compelled. You
know, as an African American, I

437
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:05,280
understand the ancestral pain
and terror felt by my Jewish

438
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,750
friends and Jews around the
world by what happened this was

439
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:14,880
not what Hamas did was not the
usual Middle East back and

440
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,980
forth. This was barbaric.

441
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,070
Adam Curry: This is literally
what you get called out for. If

442
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:24,540
you say I have a black friend.
You know, that's, that's a raw

443
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:28,410
take. No, but you can see I have
a Jewish friend but oh, that's

444
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,940
Dr. Jewish friend. Okay.

445
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:30,870
John C Dvorak: Another Jewish
friend.

446
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,980
Adam Curry: I got Jewish friend.
Oh, man. That's not so

447
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:37,350
John C Dvorak: they're pushing
this barbaric thing. So, of

448
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,080
course, so they are building up
to this and now I'm going to

449
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,340
take us into the to the
egregious editing of a Trump

450
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,520
clip to make him say stuff he
didn't say and I have the

451
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,210
original clips. I dug them up.
Okay, the way we do Yes, and I

452
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,990
want to compare one to the other
but let's start but it's also

453
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,830
the reaction first they edit it
clip, and then they react to it

454
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,130
even though the clips of fake If
they react to it and they go

455
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,700
out, they go off the rails with
how bad Trump is as a person.

456
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,240
This is the the intro to this
clip and this is Brooks Trump

457
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,770
edit intro as we

458
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,080
Unknown: talk about the Biden
administration's response and

459
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,920
response his predecessor Donald
Trump drew why criticism and

460
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,250
condemnation this past week for
faulting Netanyahu for calling

461
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,530
Hezbollah very smart in his
remarks.

462
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,710
Adam Curry: Oh, it's another
it's a new very fine people is

463
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:30,540
the very smart people. Now this
is good. This is good. Okay,

464
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,500
where do we go now?

465
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,940
John C Dvorak: Okay, so first of
all, he makes a mention he that

466
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,080
that's the host guy, the black
guy, postgame he mentions the

467
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:47,130
Netanyahu and then he mentioned
that, that Trump says Hezbollah

468
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:52,470
is very smart. And now we go to
they take the clip of a butcher

469
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:55,950
a clip, and they don't even have
it from the same feed. So it's a

470
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,820
mess. And I tried to even clean
it up with Adobe. But to hell

471
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,280
with it. Let's leave the mess
with the way it is because Adobe

472
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,510
actually doesn't work on Trump.
No interest. Very, I've noticed

473
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:12,000
this before. Adobe does not work
on Trump. They hate Trump. He

474
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,470
must. So they probably do.
Silicon Valley. So let's go to

475
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,740
this is the Brooks Trump and
this got the edited clip this is

476
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,880
to Okay,

477
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:25,260
Unknown: I'll never forget that
Bibi Netanyahu let us down. That

478
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,400
was a very terrible thing. I
will say that it is a GI Oh, PES

479
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,090
Villa desert attacks on the
north, because that's the most

480
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,290
vulnerable status.

481
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:43,980
And we can contrast that to what
Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley had

482
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,310
to say,

483
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:48,060
Israel has a right to defend
itself. And that means do that

484
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,630
to the hilt. You have to uproot
the terrorist infrastructure,

485
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,010
these networks, and Hamas needs
to be no more this is sick, and

486
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:56,190
we

487
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,770
have to treat sick people the
way they deserve to be treated

488
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,670
and eliminate them.

489
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,860
Your response to what Donald
Trump had to say.

490
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:09,150
The clip you showed is exhibit
number, whatever it is, of why

491
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,320
he should never ever again be
entrusted with the power and

492
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,610
responsibility that comes with
sitting in the Oval Office. I am

493
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,720
happy to be wrong about the
reaction from the Republican

494
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:26,160
presidential field. I thought
they would follow form and not

495
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,680
criticize Trump at all for fear
of engendering rage of their

496
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:37,260
base. But Governor Haley,
Governor DeSantis, Governor

497
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:42,000
Christie, former Vice President
Mike Pence, most of them

498
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,870
criticize Trump, and I applaud
them for that. But there's no

499
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:49,050
way that guy should be President
of the United States, again, by

500
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,280
back clip alone.

501
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,790
Adam Curry: So you know, when we
deconstruct clips, and we're

502
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,060
looking at the media and we get
another kind of feedback I read

503
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,810
earlier, these a holes are just
politicizing it for their own

504
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:04,620
for their own ego, whatever it
is, oh, whatever it is, let's

505
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,480
keep Trump out. That's That's
disgusting.

506
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,540
John C Dvorak: waiting to hear
their original Trump clips. I

507
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,200
can't wait. We can also play I
think Brookes reaction to this

508
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:20,880
same edited little clip where he
says Netanyahu, first Trump

509
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,590
brings in Netanyahu then he says
Hezbollah smart. And this says

510
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,720
they're gonna attack from the
north or something. It's a very

511
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,330
confused, it's a really screwed
up edit. And then they bring in,

512
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,410
as you heard DeSantis talking
about a Hamas, which is not what

513
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:40,410
Trump was talking about. And
then Nikki Haley saying it's

514
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,200
these people are sick, kind of
indicating that Trump

515
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,630
Adam Curry: is sick, which is
not what that was about at

516
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,180
John C Dvorak: all. That was not
what that was about. So this is

517
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:54,660
a real real hack job hack job.
Exactly. And here's the follow

518
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,650
up by Brooks.

519
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,190
Unknown: It's also a reminder of
how Donald Trump's isolationist

520
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,730
views have really realigned the
Republicans approach to foreign

521
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:03,300
policy.

522
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,390
It's stunning. I mean, it well,
first that Donald Trump clip,

523
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,020
everything is about Donald
Trump, like 1000 People get

524
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,860
murdered, and it's all about
Donald Trump. And the party has

525
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,880
you know, it was the party of,
of anti communism. It was the

526
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,690
party of American led world
order. It was the party of

527
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,330
containment against Russia
against the Soviet Union. And

528
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,910
now it's very much the opposite.
And as I look at the Republican

529
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:30,150
Party, I just want to make sure
they're gonna fund Ukraine

530
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,780
John C Dvorak: so now, these are
two guys that are supposed to be

531
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,050
arguing with each other to give
people perspective when they

532
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,630
watch the PBS NewsHour, right.
And but no, there are two guys

533
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,000
that are in total agreement.
Neither one of them are

534
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:49,740
representative of anything other
than one lone pro Ukraine view,

535
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,790
but just go back to that clip
that they butchered and listen

536
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:57,360
to Trump's actually this is a
long clip, but you need to hear

537
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,230
the whole thing in context. The
six This is actually a good

538
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,840
sorry, this isn't good. This is
good quality. This is the Trump

539
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,500
unedited comments regarding
Hezbollah being smart

540
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,830
Unknown: for $6 billion was a
tremendous amount of money, but

541
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,070
nothing compared to the hundreds
of billions of dollars that

542
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,700
Biden allowed them to make and
oil and other things, hundreds

543
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,210
of billions that became a rich
nation in three years. That's

544
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,580
why they're doing this f so much
money. They don't know what to

545
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,210
do with it. They had no money,
they were broke. And then there

546
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,660
was the inevitable attack four
days later, which I predicted.

547
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,190
And then two nights ago, I read
all of Biden security people,

548
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:39,480
can you imagine National Defense
people? And they said, Gee, I

549
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,320
hope Hezbollah doesn't attack
from the north. Because that's

550
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,650
the most vulnerable spot. I
said, Wait a minute. You know,

551
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,500
Hezbollah is very smart. They're
all very smart depressant, like

552
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,100
when they say, you know, I said
that President Xi of China, 1.4

553
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,280
billion people, he controls it
with an iron fist. He said he's

554
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,210
a very smart man. They killed me
the next day. I said he was

555
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:05,700
smart whenever I get a say. But
his was diverse. And they have a

556
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:10,170
national defense minister or
somebody saying I hope Hezbollah

557
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,140
doesn't attack us from the
north. So the following morning,

558
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,990
they attacked, they might not
have been doing it. But if you

559
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:20,430
listen to this jerk, you would
attack from the north because he

560
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:24,390
said that's our weak spot.
Whoever heard of official saying

561
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,360
on television that they hope the
enemy doesn't attack in a

562
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,010
certain area. Now unless it's a
con job. But you know what a con

563
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,520
job is you're waiting. They're
ready. You want them if you want

564
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,130
to, but they weren't ready. They
weren't ready. You know, say

565
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,430
what you want. Israel was not
ready. This was a big surprise.

566
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,710
This was a terrible thing that
happened. They weren't ready.

567
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,670
But if you wanted them to attack
because you've got a million

568
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,430
people there with guns and
you're gonna blast to hell, then

569
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:53,910
you do exactly, but they didn't
have that. They didn't have that

570
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,900
Biden's National Security
Adviser Jake Sullivan, even

571
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,080
bragged just days before the
attack that the Middle East

572
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,560
seems to be quite quiet. That
was good. They really, they

573
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,640
really, honestly what they've
done. It's a shame.

574
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,140
John C Dvorak: Yeah. Okay, now,
what couple of things about

575
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,080
that, oh, this is all in
context. It's fine. What he

576
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,130
said, Whoa, he's not
complimenting Hezbollah, like

577
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,220
they also like to imagine, but
what did you notice? There was

578
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,380
no mention of Netanyahu in that
entire

579
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,870
Adam Curry: letter. They edited
that together. So that and it

580
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:31,680
was in the intro piece. It was
two different pieces of audio.

581
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,210
That's the first thing I
noticed. Yeah,

582
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,000
John C Dvorak: it was they did a
botch job. I mean, they could

583
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,700
have had good quality because it
was all from the same speech. In

584
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,720
fact, I have the Netanyahu
piece, and the Netanyahu piece,

585
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,900
which they just pulled out of
context and dropped it in as a

586
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:50,520
cheat as a as a sleazy lowest
form of journalism thing you

587
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,350
could possibly do, which they
did on PBS. I have the Netanyahu

588
00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:00,570
piece, which actually stand
alone is very interesting and

589
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:03,090
could have been used as a
jumping off point for a big

590
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,330
discussion. And I'm surprised
that they didn't do that because

591
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,480
it's more interesting than what
they did, which was just Trump

592
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,160
batch. But listen to this. This
is Trump on on Netanyahu. It's a

593
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,740
backgrounder. That's kind of
interesting.

594
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,440
Unknown: The savage attacks on
Israel happened for three

595
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,210
reasons Biden loosen might

596
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:24,509
Adam Curry: not the grudge clip.
This is the regular live show. I

597
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,410
John C Dvorak: used to grudge
clip.

598
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,880
Unknown: I did have a bad
experience with Israel, though.

599
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:33,990
When we took out Soleimani. It
was us at Israel working as a

600
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:38,730
group. And we knew where he was.
We knew how he was coming in. We

601
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,610
knew the plane. We knew
everything. We worked on it for

602
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:45,210
weeks for months, actually. But
we worked on it for weeks. The

603
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,270
night before? Nope, I didn't I
don't think this has ever been

604
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:51,840
told. They'll say oh, it's
classified information. Well,

605
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,200
maybe it is. But I don't think
so. Israel was going to do this

606
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,440
with us. And it was being
planned and working on it for

607
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,340
months. And now we had
everything all set to go. And

608
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:07,140
the night before it happened. I
got a call that Israel will not

609
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:12,600
be participating in this attack.
Let's do it. And he came on the

610
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,900
plane and we follow them right
from the Situation Room. We

611
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:20,730
followed the whole thing and
about 15 seconds later it was

612
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:25,860
all over. And we did it but I'll
never forget. I'll never forget

613
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,480
that Bibi Netanyahu let us down
that was a very terrible thing.

614
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,030
I will say that we were
disappointed by that very

615
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,180
disappointed but we did the job
ourselves and it was absolute

616
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:41,430
precision. magnificent,
beautiful. And then maybe tried

617
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:45,450
to take credit for it. That
didn't make me feel too good but

618
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:48,870
that's all right. So they gotta
strengthen themselves up.

619
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,890
Adam Curry: Wow, that's that is
a little piece of info we didn't

620
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:53,610
know about.

621
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,400
John C Dvorak: We had no idea
but he noticed a little part in

622
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,880
that clip versus BB let us down
is the little piece they took

623
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,600
out They chopped it from that
and put it on the front end of

624
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,110
the other.

625
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,000
Adam Curry: Let's play that
intro again,

626
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,640
Unknown: as we talk about the
Biden administration's response

627
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:12,540
response, his predecessor Donald
Trump drew wide criticism and

628
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,940
condemnation this past week for
actually the beginning because

629
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,780
it's too hard to

630
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,380
Adam Curry: I'm sorry. Yeah,

631
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,640
Unknown: I'll never forget that
Bibi Netanyahu let us down. That

632
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,060
was a very terrible thing. I
will say that and they said gee,

633
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,580
I hope Hezbollah doesn't attack
from the north.

634
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:31,230
Adam Curry: Wow, that I mean,
you should you should be fired

635
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,910
from journalism for doing that.

636
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,470
John C Dvorak: They should all
be fired from PBS should PBS

637
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,490
should take a knee for for this
is the one of the most egregious

638
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:47,850
examples of editing. And false
it's this is misinformation,

639
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:48,720
misinformation.

640
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:52,620
Adam Curry: Yes. Blatant,
blatant on your national

641
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,340
treasure PBS or NPR. So I'm one
of those two, same thing.

642
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,350
John C Dvorak: So those are the
original clips and you can see

643
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:03,960
that they they totally, this is
a lie. And Brooks and K part

644
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,480
should be ashamed of themselves
for going along with it. And

645
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,690
then making a big fuss about
what a jerk Trump is.

646
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,700
Adam Curry: Unbelievable. It's
not unbelievable. It's

647
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,870
believable. It's totally booked.
No, it's

648
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,580
John C Dvorak: not unbelievable,
because it's happened

649
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:19,770
believable. Yeah. So that's
good. Good presentation.

650
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,010
Adam Curry: I like it. I like
it. Well, of course, we were

651
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:23,340
told

652
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,940
John C Dvorak: and I want to say
it again. Do not send your money

653
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,250
to these people send it to us.
Yes,

654
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,560
Adam Curry: we don't have tote
bags, but we can use the money,

655
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,760
that's for sure. So of course
everybody was all riled up about

656
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,870
the Day of Rage this

657
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,870
Unknown: morning law enforcement
officers across the country on

658
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:43,920
heightened alert after Hamas has
called for a Global Day of Rage.

659
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:47,460
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Office is pulling personnel from

660
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:54,210
specialized units to increase
visibility. In New York

661
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,110
congregates from dozens of
synagogues prayed for peace as

662
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:01,020
helicopters watch for suspicious
vehicles from above

663
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,320
and boats with radiation
detectors patrolled the waters.

664
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:09,090
The NYPD telling its officers to
prepare for 12 hour shifts.

665
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,650
We have directed the NYPD to
surge additional resources to

666
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,850
schools houses of worship to
assure that they are safe.

667
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,860
John C Dvorak: So as far as I
know, they got some day I got a

668
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:27,300
Day of Rage clip. Okay. What's
his? Well,

669
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,120
Adam Curry: there's always
something going on in the world.

670
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,840
Yeah, there's something

671
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,550
John C Dvorak: that's why I
think this is a good example.

672
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,720
This is the various 13th which
is the de river Okay, right.

673
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,800
stabbings.

674
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:41,340
Unknown: A Jewish teacher in
France is reportedly dead after

675
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,480
a knife attack to others have
been injured and asylum seeker

676
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:49,290
reportedly went on a stabbing
spree attacking various people

677
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:49,800
screaming

678
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,160
Adam Curry: alone notice notice
we've gone to asylum seekers now

679
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,800
which is the it's the word they
use in Europe. We're going to

680
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,620
use it everywhere. It does be
using this for years asylum

681
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,540
seeker. Asylum Seeker

682
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,930
Unknown: reportedly went on a
stabbing spree attacking various

683
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:07,980
people screaming Allahu Akbar,
France's President Emmanuel

684
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:12,300
Macron visited the school on
Friday afternoon. Also a staffer

685
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,170
at the Israeli embassy in China
was stabbed on the sidewalk in

686
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,710
Beijing for the chose the
diplomat being stabbed multiple

687
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,360
times by a man and white

688
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,770
Adam Curry: so that was your Day
of Rage not very successful, but

689
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,930
they got us all riled up I think
kind of everybody

690
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,290
John C Dvorak: get me riled up.
Somebody riled up didn't get

691
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,700
riled Oh, would you must have a
clip

692
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,950
Adam Curry: no agenda, people
don't know no agenda. People

693
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:37,410
don't get riled up. We just
don't get riled up. We don't

694
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,070
because we know we know what
they're doing to us. Now, I want

695
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,290
to talk about the military
industrial complex. A lot of

696
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:46,950
people benefit from this, this
crisis in the Middle East. I

697
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:51,390
just got an A message, I should
say, from Sir Brian of London,

698
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,790
boots on the ground. Who, you
know, there's this funerals this

699
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:00,600
guy's attending. He is right in
the middle of it, though, and

700
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,570
I've been back and forth with
him for days and he's having a

701
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:09,510
rough go of what's happening.
And, and he sent a video and he

702
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:12,870
has on his and I take his
credibility quite high. He's

703
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:20,400
He's a night that Israel is now
using the laser iron beam. Not

704
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,320
Iron Dome, but the iron beam.
And it's cool that they have a

705
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,500
laser now shooting things out of
the sky. Yep, yep.

706
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,330
John C Dvorak: Okay, there's a
couple of things before you go

707
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:34,020
into these clips. Did you see
the Richard angle clip that's

708
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:39,210
going around showing how the
Iron Dome supposedly works? You

709
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,850
see these missiles flying into
the air and then they're taking

710
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:46,080
a right turn and going in the
opposite direction. Have you

711
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,310
seen those clips? Well, I've

712
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,930
Adam Curry: seen it I don't know
if it's the one you're talking

713
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:49,680
about. I've seen

714
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,260
John C Dvorak: similar probably.
I just don't understand what's

715
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,510
going on with these clips
because there was always the

716
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:59,970
iron Iron Dome at work. Missile
going up and then turning around

717
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,540
Ronnie going the other way I
thought the Iron Dome was was

718
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,610
Patriot missiles that were
shooting these things out of the

719
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,150
sky.

720
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,520
Adam Curry: That's what I
thought, well not but now they

721
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:13,050
have, you can see laser beams.
In fact, Jewish laser beams. I

722
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:17,430
mean, it's a little crazy. But
I'm sure they're ours. But these

723
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,420
have directed energy weapons now
they're using which is it's

724
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:25,710
quite like whoa, okay, I didn't
expect to see that. Anyway, we

725
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,100
need to go to the military
industrial complex, which the

726
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,800
both of these people are part of
it in some way. Catherine

727
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,130
herridge, of course, the pixie
girl who was read in on all

728
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:38,310
things, military and
intelligence and John Bolton who

729
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:42,180
is just a huge moustache aihole.
And just a quick couple of clips

730
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,180
here because you know, you don't
hear from this guy for years,

731
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,880
and he's off the stage. But he's
back

732
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,310
Unknown: earlier today I spoke
with former national security

733
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:53,880
adviser to President Trump
Ambassador John Bolton about the

734
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,660
situation in the Middle East. As
we head into the weekend as a

735
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,630
former national security
adviser, what indicators are you

736
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,500
going to be watching?

737
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,440
Well, I think the big unknown
question at this point is what

738
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,190
happens with Hezbollah in the
north? I think the evidence is

739
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:12,540
clear beyond real dispute here
that the signal caller in this

740
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:17,490
operation is Iran. They armed
and prepared Hamas. I think they

741
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:19,980
unleashed him at a time they
thought it would be beneficial

742
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:24,270
to Iran in the Iran issue is Rod
part of the strategy that

743
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:28,770
they're following is to get the
Israelis sucked into Gaza in a

744
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:32,250
very heavy way, militarily, and
then to unleash Hezbollah from

745
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:36,150
the North. I think there are
some signs along the northern

746
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:39,630
border. Nothing conclusive, but
I think that's the main point of

747
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,370
danger at this point. Yes. Okay.

748
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:44,940
Adam Curry: Um, thanks. I mean,
my my sister in Italy could have

749
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,920
gone on on your show and said
that. Let's go a little deeper

750
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,400
into that.

751
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,680
John C Dvorak: Bring her on next
time. She's,

752
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,330
Adam Curry: yeah, get on
Catherine herridge. Let's get

753
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,730
this. Let's get John Bolton,
you're so interesting.

754
00:41:56,819 --> 00:41:59,909
Unknown: Let's take that a step
further. Given the scope and the

755
00:41:59,909 --> 00:42:04,439
sophistication of the Hamas
attack. Do you believe that

756
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:05,999
another shoe is going to drop

757
00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:08,039
Adam Curry: Oh, another shoe is
gonna drop?

758
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,740
Unknown: I think it's very
likely. And I think Hezbollah is

759
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,100
the most likely implementer of
that. But there may be terrorist

760
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,400
attacks around the region.
Friday has been declared a day

761
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,850
of jihad in the region and
around the world. And so this

762
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:23,940
this really could be the
beginning of a much longer

763
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,470
process here. What that will
entail, but I think anybody who

764
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:31,350
thinks hold on to the over in a
few days, unfortunately,

765
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,630
mistaken nothing happened.
Bolton

766
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,060
Adam Curry: Yeah, nothing. He's
such a prognosticator

767
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,690
John C Dvorak: genius. Oh, as a
jihad day. Yeah.

768
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:43,410
Adam Curry: Take a long time.
We're gonna need some money and

769
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,590
start printing some money. We
need money. We mean money.

770
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,110
Unknown: What does it mean here
at home, law enforcement

771
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:52,260
officials have been telling CBS
News and other media outlets

772
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,260
that they're seeing no signs of
a specific or credible threat.

773
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,570
Adam Curry: This is so much fun
to play that after the global

774
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:58,470
day at rage.

775
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:02,370
Unknown: I think at the moment
the main threat area is in the

776
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:05,430
Middle East. I think it's
Israel. It's the target, but I

777
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:11,220
think it's almost certain that
having wow wow,

778
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:13,230
John C Dvorak: wow, what a
genius.

779
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:16,740
Unknown: Look at my moustache. I
think it's almost certain that

780
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,580
having missed this attack to
begin with, not just Israeli

781
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:26,070
intelligence. But but our own
intelligence community, whatever

782
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,250
evidence there was, they didn't
draw the right conclusions. You

783
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:32,100
know, the next question you
should ask is What else have we

784
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:32,820
missed? What

785
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,780
Adam Curry: else have we missed?
Oh, we need more spy gear was

786
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:43,290
not good. You know, I just as a
as a little side note here. This

787
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,920
is fantastic story which checks
out and I'm not gonna say it's

788
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,050
related to it per se. But you've
heard of Pegasus. The spyware

789
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:56,250
Pegasus, the company Pegasus? I
think so. So Pegasus was, you

790
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:00,180
know, that's the Israeli spyware
that's on everybody's phone and

791
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,870
they've sold it all around the
world. Our our US agencies were

792
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:07,350
using a Pegasus is great. You
can be track everybody. You got

793
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:13,410
to phone Pegasus is on it. So
when, when Trump came in, and

794
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:21,690
the Obama Biden administration
left the Blinken and who is the

795
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:27,420
assistant deputy director of CIA
Avril Haines, I think is her

796
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:33,720
name Haidee something could be
they all started a lobbying firm

797
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,850
called West executive. And they
started lobbying for a competing

798
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:47,100
firm. And that firm was also
with a P. O a second

799
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,180
John C Dvorak: that Palantir

800
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,370
Adam Curry: No, no, no, no, no,
no, this is all follow up

801
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:54,030
topology Palantir now they
started lobbying of course it's

802
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:58,710
great when when you lobby you
know, as a former

803
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:03,660
administration, prepare Gone
Paragon was was call and they

804
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,790
started loving all Paragon we
gotta get you got to have

805
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:10,020
Paragon and and you know this is
no good this this Pegasus

806
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:16,410
software. And coincidentally, if
you recall the big stink about

807
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:21,300
Khashoggi was that it was
Pegasus software that the

808
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:26,520
Israeli Pegasus company had sold
to Saudi Arabia that got him

809
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,260
killed. You remember that?
Remember that?

810
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:29,790
John C Dvorak: Vaguely remembers
it?

811
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,720
Adam Curry: Yeah. So that was
probably planted by these guys

812
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,110
because they get back in with
Biden. And in March of this

813
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:41,250
year, Biden writes up this huge
executive order on prohibition

814
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,430
on use by the United States
government of certain commercial

815
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:48,210
spyware that poses risks to
national security. And when you

816
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:53,550
know, that was written precisely
to outlaw Pegasus, and have this

817
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:56,970
other software be the software
and they haven't sold it to

818
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:00,840
Saudi Arabia. So it's just a
little side note. But when you

819
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:06,240
have the Israeli government
highly relying on one software,

820
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,210
for spying on anybody with a
phone, and that's Pegasus, and

821
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,540
all of a sudden, it's no good
and everyone has to have Paragon

822
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:19,560
and that company starts to bleed
employees bloat bleed clients,

823
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:24,030
that may have contributed in
some way to some lapses in

824
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:27,120
security. I have no proof for
that. But I just thought that

825
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,330
was interesting that Sullivan
and all these eight holes,

826
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:34,110
including Ehud Barak, they were
all involved in in this lobbying

827
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:37,710
firm, and then they get in and
boom, there you go. They get rid

828
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:40,950
of that company. And this new
company is supposed to be it and

829
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:43,650
I don't even know if the
Israelis are using it. Now, just

830
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:49,110
a little side note. So when
Bolton says, oh, yeah, baby

831
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:51,660
lapse and security, maybe our
lap, maybe it was a shitty

832
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,920
software you brought in

833
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:54,180
Unknown: why are the

834
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:57,570
John C Dvorak: US or no lapse in
security? That also possible?

835
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,140
Unknown: What are the US
government's best options to

836
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,990
secure the release of the
hostages bomb Iran?

837
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:09,030
Well, I think at this point,
unfortunately, given how caught

838
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:12,480
by surprise we were, that it's
going to take rescue efforts

839
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,150
under extraordinary
extraordinarily difficult

840
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:18,180
circumstances. I mean, I think
the administration is correct to

841
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:22,590
seek a diplomatic approach
they're in gutter today. I just

842
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,470
don't think Hamas is in a mood
to bargain I think they've got

843
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:29,220
a gutter he said gutter he
didn't say cutter

844
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,980
which they're in gutter today.
Yeah, gutter is in a mood to

845
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,850
bargain. I think they've got
very valuable bargaining chips

846
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:41,340
that they're going to get a much
higher price for at least that's

847
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:44,610
what they think. I think the
hostages are in grave danger and

848
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:49,110
I think therefore any further
time that goes by before rescue

849
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:52,680
efforts begin puts their lives
in even greater danger than it

850
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,580
is already All

851
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,850
Adam Curry: right. So Bolton is
that just asking anybody to come

852
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:01,140
on who's connected to anything
Think Tank anything money

853
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,410
anything hateful, these are all
just horrible people who would

854
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:08,610
just talk him out of there but
but the best by far the best

855
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:11,970
person the best representative
of the military industrial

856
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:17,910
complex on mainstream M five M.
Television is definitely Lindsey

857
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:22,530
Graham. Lindsey Graham is
rocking it. And he is making

858
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:28,200
very sure we understand that
Iran is in our sights, boss

859
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,300
Unknown: in the last hour
announcing it's going to begin

860
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:35,220
to execute hostages and post
video evidence online for every

861
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:39,090
Israeli airstrike. your sights
on this moment, Senator?

862
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:46,110
Well, for every Israeli or
American hostage executed by

863
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:51,780
Hamas, we should take down and
Iranian oil refinery. All the

864
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,020
way you got to keep this for
from escalating is to hold Iran

865
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:55,590
accountable.

866
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,720
Adam Curry: The only way you
keep the war from escalating is

867
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,700
by bombing another country? Yes.
How

868
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,850
Unknown: much more death and
destruction do we have to take

869
00:49:03,629 --> 00:49:05,459
Adam Curry: by creating more
Lindsey

870
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:08,550
Unknown: from the Iranian
regime? I am confident this was

871
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:11,970
planned and funded by the
Iranians. Hamas is a bunch of

872
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:16,290
animals who deserve to be
treated like animals. So if I

873
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:19,770
was Israel, I would go in on the
ground. There is no truce to be

874
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:23,460
had here. I would dismantle
Hamas. This is the best

875
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,660
opportunity Israel has to
destroy Hamas. Take it to the

876
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:31,530
Iranians. If you harm one
American in Syria by using your

877
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:35,850
Iranian militia against us in
Syria, to escalate an area

878
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,720
urging Hezbollah to attack
Israel in the north, if Hamas

879
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,260
kills one American Israeli
hostage, we're going to blow up

880
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,770
your oil refineries and put you
out of business. It is now time

881
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:49,200
to take the war to the
ayatollahs backyard.

882
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:51,510
Adam Curry: I mean, he's
channeling Bush now.

883
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:53,789
John C Dvorak: They know he made
handling McCain.

884
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,590
Adam Curry: Well, but yeah, of

885
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,450
John C Dvorak: course if and if
you remember, I wish we could

886
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:00,450
find a clip where we can. Of
course, of course We have

887
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,580
Barbara and sewing as bom bom
bom bom bom Irfan

888
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:06,750
Adam Curry: I'm sure we have it

889
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,660
John C Dvorak: we do have it is
this God knows what it's called.

890
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:11,460
Yeah no this is all

891
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:16,140
Unknown: bomb bomb Iran bom bom
bom bom bom I

892
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:25,050
Adam Curry: think it's our own
version. I like it.

893
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,160
Unknown: Bom bom bom bom bom
Moran. Yeah.

894
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,770
John C Dvorak: So the ghost of
John McCain.

895
00:50:38,009 --> 00:50:38,939
Adam Curry: He's still with us.
He's

896
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,940
John C Dvorak: still with us.
And he's being channeled through

897
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,170
Lindsey Graham now if you

898
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:46,050
Adam Curry: think that was good
and who is his buddy and just as

899
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:49,830
an aside, this is exactly what
we talked about this has always

900
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:54,360
been on the radar. This is pure
evil that exists in the West,

901
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:58,080
not even one group of people is
just evil that is taken over.

902
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,560
And they these people don't
actually care about dead

903
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,290
Israelis or dead Palestinians.
They don't care about any of

904
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:06,780
that. They don't care about you.
They don't care about me. They

905
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:11,760
just care about the programming
they have in their brain to just

906
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,150
bomb stuff more money getting
into the markets, we need stuff

907
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:17,250
to happen. This is what we live
for.

908
00:51:17,279 --> 00:51:20,789
Unknown: What I would do is I
would bomb a Ron's all

909
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:24,269
infrastructure, the money
financing terrorism. This is on

910
00:51:24,269 --> 00:51:28,799
CNN now comes from Iran. It's
time for this terrorist state to

911
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:33,359
pay a price for financing and
supporting all this chaos. Yes,

912
00:51:33,389 --> 00:51:37,169
if you're the Iranians, if we're
up to me, this war escalates.

913
00:51:37,169 --> 00:51:38,249
I'm coming after you.

914
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,670
I think this is what I'm trying
to clarify here. Because I'm

915
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:43,200
wondering, listen,

916
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,940
Israel, US and Israel, is

917
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:48,690
the United States. Crystal clear
The United States. Let me just

918
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,510
let me just understand you.

919
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,770
John C Dvorak: What was the
point of that he

920
00:51:55,770 --> 00:52:00,120
Adam Curry: has no he he's
telegraphing that we aren't

921
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,690
going to do it. It's US and
Israel, Israel, Israel, but

922
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:08,190
okay. And the telegraphing is
we're going to give them all the

923
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:11,190
stuff, Bibi is going to pull the
trigger, someone's going to pull

924
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:15,270
there's not going to be us. Now
we want Israel

925
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,320
John C Dvorak: to throw that in
because he forgot to do that

926
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,340
earlier. Yes. You

927
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:23,250
Unknown: forgot, drill us in
Israel, the United States.

928
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:25,500
Crystal clear in the United.

929
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,950
Adam Curry: Let me just let me
join operations. That was

930
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,520
exactly what Trump was talking
about when when Bibi pulled out

931
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,070
of the joint operation. Isn't
that interesting. But he's

932
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,240
clear. It's clear. Now I

933
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:39,450
Unknown: understand you. Just to
be clear, you're saying that you

934
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:43,800
would want the United States and
Israel to bomb Iran, even in the

935
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,550
absence of direct evidence of
their involvement in this

936
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:51,240
attack? Hey, yeah, so

937
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:58,680
Adam Curry: what evidence,
evidence Come on? Everybody

938
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,110
knows this. Yeah.

939
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:05,220
Unknown: If there's an
escalation, Abby, there's

940
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:10,260
people's throats being cut on
television, as Israel goes into

941
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:11,070
Gaza.

942
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,260
Adam Curry: She's already
telling us what the what the

943
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:18,120
nightly programming is going to
be. It's as if he knows Oh, if

944
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:22,800
we start seeing people's throats
getting slit on television, wow,

945
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,890
tick tock, maybe television
really, really, they haven't

946
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:29,250
shown much on television, or
shown anything. Please don't

947
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,350
email us. We've seen that we've
seen

948
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:33,270
John C Dvorak: Okay, now we got
to telegraph account. Don't

949
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:36,840
worry about we have a telegraph
but

950
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,110
Adam Curry: he is telegraphing.
He is telegraphing what we're

951
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:40,890
going to see.

952
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,420
Unknown: Yeah. So if there's an
escalation, Abby, if there's

953
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,640
pappy throats being cut until
How is

954
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,560
Adam Curry: people's throat
being cut on television

955
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:53,820
escalation of anything, but the
mainstream media is not an

956
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:57,810
escalation of the atrocities?
No, I mean,

957
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,240
John C Dvorak: no, I know
exactly what you mean. He's

958
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,690
just, he's gotta be he's got a
script. He's going by I don't

959
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:07,560
know where it came from who's
delivered it? But it's always

960
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,010
well, of course, again, I like
I'll say it again, it came.

961
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:16,680
We're behind. we're way behind
on that. On that on the west

962
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,180
Clarke seven. Yep. And things
are time is running out on this

963
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,820
Iran deal. So they're either
going to have to do they got to

964
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,280
take action now because this is
the last bit and if Trump comes

965
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,530
back in office, which is
possible, not gonna happen,

966
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,530
won't happen. Not gonna happen.
So they mean something will

967
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:33,210
happen. But we will be that
which

968
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:35,610
Adam Curry: is exactly why
Brooks and Dawn are over there

969
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:39,090
saying, oh, it'd be horrible if
Trump came back in Oh, no,

970
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:43,890
because then we won't be able to
bomb Iran. So I know Iranians,

971
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,260
by Iranian friends.

972
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,880
Unknown: If there's an
escalation Abby, if there's Pam

973
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,880
throats being cut on television,
as Israel goes in Gaza, and

974
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,240
they're threatening to kill the
hostages of Hezbollah, As

975
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,350
unleashed on Israel in the
north, it will be because Iran

976
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:09,150
is supporting that. If you don't
get the connection between Iran

977
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,180
and this terrorist activity by
Hamas and Hezbollah, you're

978
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:15,030
missing a lot. This is a
terrorist state that has

979
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:19,320
American blood on its hands. It
is now time to dismantle the

980
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:24,180
financing system of terrorism.
If this war escalates, yes, I

981
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,030
would do to joint military
operation joint I tell the

982
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:30,660
Iranians today, if the war
escalates, you will pay a price

983
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,210
you will be out of that all
business want to be crystal

984
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:34,470
clear? And if we don't,

985
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,600
Adam Curry: that's interesting.
You'll be out of the oil

986
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,230
business, the oil before
business, are they still in the

987
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:41,100
oil business?

988
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,790
John C Dvorak: Or did they trip
up, though tripped the clip by

989
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:49,800
played from Trump starts off
with him talking about the fact

990
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,190
that they went from nothing to
let allowing him to produce oil

991
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:57,990
to the tune of 80 to $100
billion in profits war in Iran.

992
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:03,330
All day, I would like you to
play the just the beginning of

993
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:06,000
this again, because this is the

994
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,760
Adam Curry: which one is that
which is the clip.

995
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:16,740
John C Dvorak: I think it's the
BB background. But no, it's the

996
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,290
unedited comments just right.
The very beginning. He's talking

997
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:19,920
about Iran

998
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:23,250
Unknown: for $6 billion was a
tremendous amount of money, but

999
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:26,460
nothing compared to the hundreds
of billions of dollars that

1000
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:30,030
Biden allowed them to make and
oil and other things hundreds

1001
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,430
and 1000s it became a rich
nation.

1002
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:37,680
Adam Curry: Oh, yes. Yes, yes.
Yes. Yes. Good catch. Trump's

1003
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,650
John C Dvorak: blaming it on
Biden. Yeah. More because they

1004
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:44,040
loosened up some restrictions,
of course, sanctions.

1005
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:47,400
Unknown: If the war escalation
will pay a price, you will be

1006
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,240
either all of this.

1007
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:51,330
Adam Curry: Do we? Did we ever
get those hostages back, by the

1008
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:57,930
way, which was the ones that we
paid $6 billion for? Have they

1009
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:00,690
been interviewed? Or have they
been on 60 minutes have been

1010
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:03,600
this would be a big deal? I
mean, these are each person's

1011
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,600
about a billion bucks. Should we
be talking to them

1012
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:09,390
John C Dvorak: to remember there
was hostages involved in this

1013
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:10,260
deal? Yeah, that's

1014
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:14,910
Adam Curry: guess the $6 billion
was to get hostages back from

1015
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:15,480
Iran.

1016
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:18,420
John C Dvorak: Iran? Oh, that's
right. There was a few

1017
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:19,380
prisoners. Yeah,

1018
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,930
Adam Curry: prisoners. Alright.
Do we do we? Do we know even who

1019
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:24,210
that what their names are? If
they'd been on television? I

1020
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:24,540
mean,

1021
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,420
John C Dvorak: their names or
their CIA names? Thank you.

1022
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:30,150
Unknown: If the war escalates,
you will pay a price you will be

1023
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:33,270
either or business. Want to be
crystal clear on that? And if we

1024
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:36,600
don't do that, what do you
expect to happen in the future?

1025
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:41,130
Do you expect Israel to forgive
and forget? Biden did mention

1026
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,130
one word about Iran today and I
want to support the president.

1027
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:48,810
I'm supporting the Saudi Israel
peace deal. Israel made peaceful

1028
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:52,230
several Arab countries through
their Abraham Rickroll course. I

1029
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:55,650
want to help the Palestinians we
can do business with as part of

1030
00:57:55,650 --> 00:58:00,420
a Saudi Israel peace deal, but
I'm tired of letting Iran I

1031
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:04,530
think they did this to stop the
Saudi Arab peace negotiations.

1032
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:07,380
The Iranians, I don't want to
reward them I want to punish

1033
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:07,590
them.

1034
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:11,010
Adam Curry: Now that he says
that I think that's bull crap,

1035
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:14,340
too. But this month Oh, they did
this to stop the peace

1036
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:19,020
negotiations really? Really
think that Iran just I mean, is

1037
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,900
it true Iran just wants death
and destruction?

1038
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,980
John C Dvorak: Bring back a
tweet I mentioned in the

1039
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:30,870
newsletter somebody posted which
was about it seems a little

1040
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:37,680
weird. That on the 50th
anniversary of the famous Yamba

1041
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:42,000
Kapoor award, the 50th
anniversary debt the debt Israel

1042
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,050
let down their guard.

1043
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:47,910
Adam Curry: Yes, see? Seems like
we you know, did you remember

1044
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,580
odd? Did you read Seymour Hersh
his

1045
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:53,610
John C Dvorak: piece? No, no, I
didn't know what he did. What'd

1046
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:54,600
he say this time so

1047
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,560
Adam Curry: it was also the
Sukkot celebration. But yeah, so

1048
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,890
I'm gonna reading verbatim from
his just reading a paragraph or

1049
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:04,830
two. The so called celebration
near Palestinian village, known

1050
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:08,760
in Hebrew is how it should need
would need extra ordinary

1051
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,250
protection given the tension
over the latest violence and the

1052
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,950
local Israeli military
authorities with the approval of

1053
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:17,640
Netanyahu ordered two of the
three army battalions each with

1054
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,400
about 800 soldiers that
protected the border with Gaza

1055
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:24,090
to shift their focus to the so
called festival that left only

1056
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:28,320
800 soldiers the insider told me
to be responsible for guarding

1057
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,560
the 51 kilometer border between
the Gaza Strip and southern

1058
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,100
Israel. That meant the Israeli
citizens in the South were left

1059
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:39,060
without an Israeli military
military presence for 10 to 12

1060
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:42,090
hours. They were left to fend
for themselves. And that is why

1061
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:45,840
Bibi is finished. It may take a
few months but he's over. Now.

1062
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,880
I'm jumping ahead because I want
to get to that because I have

1063
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:51,840
some other things that play into
that. But first we need to

1064
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:56,190
listen to Lindsey Graham. He's
just I mean, you could do a

1065
00:59:56,190 --> 01:00:00,210
super In fact, I'll probably get
a super cut. So now he got I was

1066
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:02,580
done with crystal meth and he
lays out this plan.

1067
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:06,600
Unknown: Listen to me now and
listen to me good. We should,

1068
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,560
without lubricant, go into Gaza
from behind. I know it sounds

1069
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:14,970
brutal, but we need to penetrate
them blow our loads. And then

1070
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:21,480
subsequently Plowshares ai i
love it. Actually, if we stay

1071
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,960
inside for an extended period of
time because we need to make

1072
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,550
sure that the deed is done. I
have been an expert on this

1073
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:33,030
subject for many years. And I
think now is the time to act.

1074
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:36,030
Adam Curry: That's AI obviously,
but I thought it was fun fun to

1075
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:36,300
play.

1076
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:39,870
John C Dvorak: It is was the AI
is getting funnier. Yeah. The

1077
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:42,960
problem, of course, is that if
you don't listen to our show,

1078
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,640
and you don't know or super
skeptical about everything, you

1079
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:51,690
will be susceptible to some AI
shenanigans. But

1080
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:55,080
Adam Curry: the whole point of
good AI is that you catch on and

1081
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,600
it's funny. I mean, otherwise it
just no good.

1082
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:00,420
John C Dvorak: Most people can't
do that and lizard kind of

1083
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:05,100
training. You have trained ears.
I don't believe that 90% of the

1084
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:09,960
people that would hear that 90
wouldn't buy into it.

1085
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,060
Adam Curry: No, come on. It's
like yeah, we gotta

1086
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,440
John C Dvorak: say that, but

1087
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:19,350
Adam Curry: that's fine. That's
fine. Now before I get to the

1088
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:22,860
Netanyahu bid, just one more
just as its global, the whole

1089
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:28,770
Iran focus, as we suspected, yea
perhaps predicted is everywhere

1090
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:33,930
as let's go to the European arm
of the CIA propaganda machine

1091
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,390
toyed chavalla with some think
tank aihole

1092
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:39,360
Unknown: for its incursion,
Hamas has used 1000s of drones

1093
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,900
and rockets and carried out
cyber attacks. The conflict has

1094
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:46,140
raised questions as to how the
group is able to finance these

1095
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,670
complex attacks.

1096
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:52,140
Adam Curry: They've done cyber
attacks. This is news to me.

1097
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:57,270
Every cyber attack is always
Russia. Now Hamas has done North

1098
01:01:57,270 --> 01:02:01,440
Korea. Now Hamas has done cyber
attacks, very complex seems

1099
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,180
unlikely. Well, it's the CIA
come on these or whatever

1100
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:09,270
Unknown: questions as to how the
group is able to finance these

1101
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:13,230
complex attacks. Israeli
retaliation also has enormous

1102
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,950
costs for the economy of the
Gaza Strip, which is under Hamas

1103
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:20,310
rule. Joining me for this
conversation is Matthew Levitt.

1104
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:22,980
He's the director of the program
on counterterrorism and

1105
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:27,060
intelligence at the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy.

1106
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:30,150
Adam Curry: Oh, goodness, I
mean, you know exactly what this

1107
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:33,360
is. We need a gig like that. I
want to be at the National

1108
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,570
Institute for terror Near East
Institute,

1109
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:39,330
John C Dvorak: something up like
that, and probably do as well as

1110
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:40,860
we're doing for the show, or
better

1111
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:45,630
Unknown: East policy, has been
using drones, cyber attacks and

1112
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:50,220
rockets against Israel. Where is
it getting the funding for these

1113
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:51,060
weapons from

1114
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,700
Adam Curry: a where's it
getting? Hello, hello, Think

1115
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:57,870
Tank guy, Hamas and Hezbollah
things in the background? Why

1116
01:02:57,870 --> 01:03:03,600
what I'm just out of curiosity,
do you have any idea where

1117
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,230
they're getting the funding for
these cyber attacks? Could you

1118
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:10,260
Could I'm at a loss, what could
it be

1119
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:13,620
Unknown: moss is funding streams
have changed over the years in

1120
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:18,720
particular, in 2007, when Hamas
took over the Gaza Strip by

1121
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:22,020
force of arms, pointing its guns
not at Israel In that instance,

1122
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:25,590
Israel had already withdrawn but
against Palestinians, once it

1123
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:28,830
controlled territory, it was
able to tax some might say

1124
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:33,960
extort the local population. And
that is its primary source of

1125
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:39,330
income right now. The second
most important source of income

1126
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:42,000
and this is something that has
been consistent over decades

1127
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:45,750
since the founding of Hamas in
the late 1980s. US government

1128
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:49,770
estimates that Iran provides
some us somewhere between 70 and

1129
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:54,210
$100 million a year, probably
additional funds and moments of

1130
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:58,560
crisis like this. And that has
been constant. That is money

1131
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:01,680
that is in kind that is weapons
there is on top of that

1132
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:04,080
training, intelligence support,
etc.

1133
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,900
Adam Curry: Okay, so it's clear
who we need to go after because

1134
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:10,020
Iran is the problem. It's not a
bunch of nut jobs known as

1135
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:13,620
Hamas, who are just blood
thirsty. We don't even have to

1136
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:17,310
talk about the genesis of that.
We've done that. But it's all

1137
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:20,250
her right. It's all about Iran.
It's all about Iran. Now. We get

1138
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:23,940
to Bibi Netanyahu and another
player that we haven't really we

1139
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:28,170
haven't played paid any
attention to this woman. So my

1140
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:31,170
initial and I think yours will
be one of the initial who

1141
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:34,320
benefits from this. Well, you
know, Biden benefits as a war

1142
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:41,430
president Hunter Biden benefits
the NGOs who are flowing asylum

1143
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:45,630
seekers into every Western
country in the world. They

1144
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:48,060
benefit don't look at our
border. Look at that one. Look

1145
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:50,760
at that. 51 kilometer. Now, look
at that board. That board over

1146
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,940
there that board, don't look at
Ukraine. Don't look at any of

1147
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:58,200
this stuff. So a whole bunch of
people the end machinery

1148
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,690
benefits and the military
industrial comp everyone

1149
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:04,170
benefits benefits benefits Wall
Street's gonna benefit everybody

1150
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,620
the oil guys are gonna benefit
are benefiting my friend paid

1151
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:13,200
for dinner so I know he's
benefiting but but Netanyahu had

1152
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,470
this huge problem and I think we
need to revisit this it's

1153
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:20,520
controversial because we have
understood this from many people

1154
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:25,530
boots on the ground no agenda
producers that the Supreme Court

1155
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:28,770
I'm just I'm just gonna use the
simple version Supreme Court of

1156
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:34,590
Israel, Israel Israel they have
precedence over the parliament

1157
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:38,010
but over the government they can
say, you know, we don't like

1158
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:41,010
this law or this run of the
blue, they can do it whenever

1159
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:41,160
they

1160
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,140
John C Dvorak: will slightly
different than our Supreme Court

1161
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,900
which has to have it presented
to them through the court

1162
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:46,350
system.

1163
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:48,450
Adam Curry: Yes. And then here,
it's just um, yeah, we don't

1164
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:49,020
like what you did.

1165
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,230
John C Dvorak: Key Exactly.
Yeah, it's pretty. And it's

1166
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:52,530
really

1167
01:05:52,829 --> 01:05:56,609
Adam Curry: also filled with an
app going on a limb because I'm

1168
01:05:56,609 --> 01:05:59,459
not really schooled in it. But
in Israel, you have Ashkenazi

1169
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:02,969
Jews and Sarfati I think is
Sephardi Jews, which would be

1170
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:07,049
like my 40 Sephardic, like my
buddy Benco Han, who wouldn't go

1171
01:06:07,049 --> 01:06:10,949
dark all have dark skin, then
and in the Supreme Court is

1172
01:06:10,949 --> 01:06:14,519
pretty much all the white Jews,
the Ashkenazi Jews and their

1173
01:06:14,549 --> 01:06:17,429
leaders and their woke stirs.
And they're just like, the

1174
01:06:17,429 --> 01:06:21,059
liberal, the nut jobs here in
the United States.

1175
01:06:21,449 --> 01:06:22,259
John C Dvorak: Yeah. And,

1176
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:24,060
Adam Curry: you know, they're
like, Yeah, you know, everything

1177
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:27,810
LGBTQ, you know, everything's
all good. It's all beautiful.

1178
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:29,970
You know, we could you know, you
know, don't just the whole

1179
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:33,270
thing, everything is It's
identical. And Bibi Netanyahu,

1180
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:37,530
who I've always considered to be
very sketchy guy, I said, sketch

1181
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:42,030
them very sketch says, I'm gonna
retract that. I'm both. I've

1182
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:45,060
always been skeptical about the
guy. He's like, Yeah, go it. But

1183
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:48,030
we've been programmed to think
he's a criminal. He's a

1184
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:52,170
gangster, he's no good. He's a
war monger. He was voted in by

1185
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:56,790
Democratic vote, if you trust
elections, to change with one

1186
01:06:56,790 --> 01:07:01,410
mandate to change the judicial
system, so that the people of

1187
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:04,950
Israel would feel like they
actually have a say, and not

1188
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:08,220
just this star pushed around by
the judiciary. Yes, this

1189
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:12,450
Starfleet Command. And so what
happened was, and this is Sir

1190
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:17,040
Brian of London has said these
riots that were ongoing that had

1191
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:21,960
been going on since his
election, and all of these, all

1192
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:26,640
of the accusations and their,
they hate gays, and they're

1193
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,090
corrupt, and they're horrible
people, he says is pretty much

1194
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:34,530
identical to Trump and Black
Lives Matter. And that these

1195
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:37,590
protests are, you know, and so
all professional signs and

1196
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:40,200
people are getting riled up and
the military is getting

1197
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:45,150
involved. But it was it's been
led by a very interesting woman

1198
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:52,440
named Sheikh my Bressler thinks
she's 4142. Good looking. She

1199
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:56,250
actually started the Black Flag
protest earlier, which is much

1200
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:59,550
more black lives matter related,
but she led this protest. She's

1201
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:04,530
a physical that a particle
physicist from CERN. But somehow

1202
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:08,460
she got drafted into the to
being the leader of this

1203
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:14,670
protest. And I could not find
it. But she apparently somewhere

1204
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:17,730
along the line said, you know,
this Netanyahu, you better give

1205
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:20,010
it up. Something bad's gonna
happen. end of September, I've

1206
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:22,830
been looking for that quote.
Because that would kind of that

1207
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:27,810
would close the loop. But she
was interviewed by The Times of

1208
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:31,950
Israel. And I just pulled a
couple of clips because I have a

1209
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:37,980
feeling that this protest cannot
be isolated from what happened

1210
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:42,030
by the lapse in security, as
certainly maybe the lack of

1211
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:46,470
response from the military. And
the fact that Seymour Hersh, who

1212
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:50,700
we I hold him pretty in high
regard. Seymour Hersh says this

1213
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:56,130
guy's finished, he's done. This
might have been a plan to get

1214
01:08:56,130 --> 01:09:00,120
rid of Netanyahu that perhaps
they misjudged, and it went too

1215
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:04,830
far. Here's a little bit of this
interview with Schick, my

1216
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:06,180
Bressler so she come

1217
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:10,709
Unknown: I asked you What
matters now. Maybe it will sound

1218
01:09:10,709 --> 01:09:14,069
a bit dramatic. But what matters
now is really to

1219
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:16,890
Adam Curry: say I'm sorry, I
should say this interview is

1220
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:20,730
from March of this year. Just
coincidentally, the same time

1221
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:23,580
Biden did that executive order
with the security change, but

1222
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:26,850
I'm not necessarily connecting
those two, it'd be actually

1223
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:31,050
Unknown: sound a bit dramatic.
But what matters now is really

1224
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:34,500
to save the Israeli democracy to
save the state and nation of

1225
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:39,960
Israel. I as part of my duties
and job in Weitzman and being

1226
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:43,830
part of a huge international
collaboration. I do talk to many

1227
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:48,660
people from abroad. And what is
clear to me is that people do

1228
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:53,130
not aware of the dramatic things
that are happening these days in

1229
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:56,700
Israel. And the fact that if we
will discuss it in a month from

1230
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:00,120
now we could be already beyond
the point of no return for What

1231
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:04,110
people need to take away out of
this conversation and not wait

1232
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:06,900
to the end of it is to
understand that we are now these

1233
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:13,110
days facing a yield curve in the
sense that if we are not able to

1234
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:17,250
stop what is going on at the
moment, in a couple of weeks,

1235
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:22,710
days, maybe Israeli will no
longer be a democracy. And then

1236
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:27,450
once the point of no return has
passed, it will take decades to

1237
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:30,810
get back from this point. And
maybe it will not even be

1238
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:34,650
possible. And I know it sounds
dramatic, but it is dramatic.

1239
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:39,000
But this is the circumstances,
this is what matters now. I

1240
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,990
think that people are not really
digesting, fully digesting what

1241
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:45,990
is going on. And it is dramatic.
And it's happening now.

1242
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:48,570
Adam Curry: The only thing she
didn't say was existential

1243
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:51,120
crisis. That's the only thing
that was missing from that. And

1244
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:51,810
by the way, it's

1245
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:55,140
John C Dvorak: very similar to
the Trump is a threat to

1246
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:56,370
democracy somehow.

1247
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,730
Adam Curry: Yes. And I realized
that my sources are limited. But

1248
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:03,090
I'm just giving you this. My
view may be different. On

1249
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:03,840
Thursday, it'll

1250
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:04,500
John C Dvorak: develop Don't

1251
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:06,540
Adam Curry: worry, yeah. But
people like

1252
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:11,760
John C Dvorak: that kind of same
guy.

1253
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:16,140
Adam Curry: So. So then, in this
next bit from the interview, she

1254
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:19,830
says something that catches my
ear, and my ears perk up,

1255
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:21,810
because I've heard this
somewhere else, listen to this.

1256
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,410
Unknown: How could you just to
play devil's advocate? How could

1257
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:30,660
you possibly when the government
coalition will pass the overhaul

1258
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:35,280
builds? Because it can, it's in
power, it will do that? So what

1259
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:39,930
is a win for you? So first of
all, some extent we are already

1260
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:43,110
a winning maybe we are winning a
battle, but not the entire

1261
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:45,750
world. But you have to
understand it's a try. If you

1262
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:50,340
look at the the changes that
opened in Hungary in the last

1263
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:54,450
decade, and you when you make
the new when you compare it to

1264
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:57,720
what is being done here, they
try to do what Obama did in a

1265
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:01,230
decade in Hungary to do here in
two months. As I said, it's not

1266
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:05,340
just one law that they are
trying to pass, but it's more

1267
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:12,480
than 120 loads that are being
really ambushed on on us. And

1268
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,480
this will probably not happen
the way that they want they

1269
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:19,890
start to tell going to you know,
to do this legislation and they

1270
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:25,920
will be done with it in no time.
No no defense. And then now they

1271
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,710
need to change that. So they're
calling back a lot of they're

1272
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:34,830
seeing and only focusing on this
committee for the election of

1273
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:37,920
judges, which is the core thing
if you go back again to hunger

1274
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,040
you will see is that this is how
all been started by taking

1275
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:46,530
control over the judicial the
courts and the judges so they

1276
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:48,270
are focusing on that. So when

1277
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:53,010
Adam Curry: I heard this I'm
like what Orban committed a coup

1278
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:59,400
in Hungary and overthrew the
judiciary and the country's calm

1279
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:06,570
and orderly and people seem to
be happy there. Did I miss

1280
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:09,420
something that he's a dictator

1281
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:13,290
John C Dvorak: may have been
pushing the Orban being a

1282
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:18,180
dictator the left has for at
least the entire

1283
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:21,930
Adam Curry: or ban the guy who
would not mandate vaccines who

1284
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:22,980
would not eat

1285
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,790
John C Dvorak: or Bond started
the problem by blocking the

1286
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:30,870
didn't do initial wave of
refugees from the Middle East.

1287
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:35,130
Yeah, back 10 years ago yes. Or
Bond threw up defenses and said

1288
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:35,610
no.

1289
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:39,270
Adam Curry: And the people of
Hungary have seem to be happy

1290
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:41,850
with him. I have seen protests.

1291
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:45,090
John C Dvorak: I don't want to
say you know, bring this guy

1292
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:50,310
into the picture but it's as you
recall, Tucker went there and

1293
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:53,190
hung out with him and Jed tried
to look around for some sort of

1294
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:58,410
problem and could find nothing
Orban did take on the judiciary

1295
01:13:58,410 --> 01:14:02,670
which did have an issue that
with the I don't know this is

1296
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:04,080
like nuts. Okay,

1297
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,360
Adam Curry: so when this
triggered me I went whoa, hold

1298
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,530
on a second hold on

1299
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:10,440
John C Dvorak: or bonds anti
globalist Yeah, obviously this

1300
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:14,460
woman is globalist and this is
the word this what we're dealing

1301
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:15,510
with now somehow.

1302
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:19,080
Adam Curry: So now three weeks
ago, 60 minutes does an

1303
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:26,760
interview with three Israeli IDF
soldiers they're in uniform. One

1304
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:31,230
is a helicopter pilot one is and
that's the she was always sexy.

1305
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:36,180
female combat chopper pilot
lesbian. Does it get any better

1306
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:40,500
than that? The other one is
special forces. And I forget

1307
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:44,520
what the third was. And they're
just talking about how horrible

1308
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:48,090
Netanyahu is. It's the same
topic three weeks ago. Listen to

1309
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:48,480
this

1310
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:51,600
Unknown: head of national
security has had multiple

1311
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:55,140
convictions, including
supporting terrorism against

1312
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:59,970
Arabs. The finance minister is a
self described fascist.

1313
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,410
homophobe. As for Netanyahu, he
is in the midst of three

1314
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:09,690
separate trials on charges of
corruption. The protesters say

1315
01:15:09,690 --> 01:15:13,770
that laws his government has
introduced over 200 of them

1316
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:17,790
would not only weaken the
courts, but control the press

1317
01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:21,990
and diminish individual rights.
And that this is how democracies

1318
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:24,450
like Hungary became autocratic.

1319
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:28,590
What's happened in Hungary and
Poland will not happen here.

1320
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:33,540
There is a trend and it's going
against you. Around the World.

1321
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:37,080
We'll be the first to stop it.
You're all determined.

1322
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:42,180
We are not joking. We are really
trying to stop it and we will

1323
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:42,810
succeed.

1324
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:47,910
One of the big worries is that
without a strong Supreme Court,

1325
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:52,350
the ultra orthodox block and the
government could turn Israel

1326
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:56,460
into a theocracy where biblical
laws prevail.

1327
01:15:57,030 --> 01:16:00,750
Our Supreme Court is our last
line of defense. And this is our

1328
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:03,930
last safeguard. We need them
empowered. We need them

1329
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,960
independent, that what we fight
for

1330
01:16:07,049 --> 01:16:09,179
what is at stake for women,
Shira,

1331
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,960
that will be sitting in the back
of the bus. Literally,

1332
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:19,740
literally. Are you married? I'm
married to a woman, a doctor. We

1333
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:22,230
have a daughter, she's one year
and eight months.

1334
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:26,940
Her fear of an assault on
women's and gay rights is well

1335
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:31,140
founded. A government member
said the gay community is more

1336
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:33,750
dangerous than ISIS and
Hezbollah.

1337
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:36,510
Adam Curry: Oh crap. For some
reason. I must have cut out the

1338
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:41,130
bit worse. They talk about
Poland Hungary. No, I heard it.

1339
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,950
Oh, it was in there. I
completely missed it. Hello.

1340
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,900
Sorry. I just thought it came.
You know,

1341
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,990
John C Dvorak: they mentioned
both countries as as autocratic

1342
01:16:48,990 --> 01:16:51,870
countries. Yes. Polar. I'm
giving you a clip of the day for

1343
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:53,640
digging that baby out of the
woods.

1344
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,830
Unknown: ever done? Oh, no,

1345
01:16:58,830 --> 01:17:02,610
Adam Curry: no, no. This is by
this is truly mine. It's not

1346
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:05,190
coincidence. I know who gave it
to me. I know who does this.

1347
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:11,970
It's It's Supernatural. So I get
this clip. And I'm like, Whoa,

1348
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:15,480
this is the same talking point.
Poland Poland. same

1349
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:18,660
John C Dvorak: talking points. I
exactly. And it's interesting,

1350
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:22,260
because it kind of parallels the
queers for Palestine movement.

1351
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:25,440
Yep. Which I, which I
highlighted in the newsletter,

1352
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,860
and people should go read the
newsletter and click on the

1353
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:33,480
link, or just go to Google or
duck duck go, which is what I

1354
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:37,800
use at queers for Palestine and
start reading what's going on in

1355
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:42,690
Israel with the game movement
there. And the symbiosis with

1356
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:46,950
Palace Steen and the fact that
they're all you know, they, it's

1357
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:50,070
just very strange. And I think
it's part of that I think with a

1358
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:53,730
clip you just played is part of
queers for Palestine.

1359
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:57,900
Adam Curry: So the problem is
that they said, We're not going

1360
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:03,090
to let it happen, we will do
what it takes. And then here go,

1361
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:06,390
but going back to schema, the
leader of this movement,

1362
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:10,950
Unknown: so I think that if, as
I said, if this laws will pass,

1363
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:18,900
by definition, the Israeli court
system will be underneath the

1364
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:21,570
political system, the
government, by definition, it's

1365
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:26,430
not a Democratic democracy
anymore. And then we'll have to

1366
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:29,400
you know, we will wake up one
day for something completely

1367
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:33,150
different than what we were used
to, I think that then then what

1368
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:36,360
we will see here is that the
country conditions fall, you

1369
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:42,540
know, goes down quickly, you you
we heard yesterday, large groups

1370
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:46,260
from the reserve army unit
saying that if this happens,

1371
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:50,580
they will not they will not they
will not serve a dictatorship,

1372
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:54,600
they will only that we are here
we all took our oath to protect

1373
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:57,060
the democratic a Jewish
democratic country and not a

1374
01:18:57,060 --> 01:19:02,250
dictator. I think that we see it
already we will be affected

1375
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:05,280
economically, very dramatically
will be affected basically, in

1376
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:10,080
every aspect, it may not be
happening in one day, but But

1377
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:13,170
again, if you look at countries
that went down the throats or

1378
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:17,100
condition, and then it will be a
huge and a long battle, which

1379
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:24,390
will which you know, we will all
be losing, but but it will be it

1380
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:26,010
will be awful, to be awful.

1381
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:30,870
Adam Curry: So she says right
there, that reservists army will

1382
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:35,970
not defend a dictator. They will
not defend, I presume Israel.

1383
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:41,550
And I'm just putting a couple
things together here. It was

1384
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:45,120
like, Do you think it's possible
that that they thought, well,

1385
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:48,450
you know, we'll let some we'll
let some terrorists come in and

1386
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:48,960
do a little

1387
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:52,080
John C Dvorak: one. They tore
down that fence with bulldozers

1388
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:56,520
and nobody did anything or even
took a shot at them. That was

1389
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:01,440
extremely suspicious if you
asked me They bring bulldozers

1390
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:05,460
up to the fence, and just night
the fence over when nobody does

1391
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:06,300
it. And when you have

1392
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:09,450
Adam Curry: when you have the
crowd, just like Black Lives

1393
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:12,660
Matter when you have the crowd
program, this is an existential

1394
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:17,070
crisis. You don't know what
people are capable of doing or

1395
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:21,330
not doing. So if everyone's been
this, I mean, you don't see it

1396
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:25,380
much on M five M here. But in
this research, I've been looking

1397
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:28,680
at some of the video these
protests, you know, getting

1398
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:29,490
pretty rowdy.

1399
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:33,510
John C Dvorak: So there are and
monstrous or monstrous protests.

1400
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:37,260
Adam Curry: And so if if there's
like, Okay, this is existential

1401
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:41,640
to the democracy and the
survival of us here in Israel,

1402
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:48,000
Israel L, then it's, it's not
unthinkable that this could have

1403
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:56,220
been, at, at minimum, just let
go. And then they underestimated

1404
01:20:56,910 --> 01:21:01,920
how ready or how bad it would be
Hamas was or how bad it would

1405
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:02,490
be. I mean,

1406
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:05,130
John C Dvorak: they could have
estimated how they

1407
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:09,240
underestimated how bad would be,
which but if we take this line

1408
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:12,360
of thinking, which nobody wants
to do, no, because it's very

1409
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:15,360
unpopular and very busy gonna
get more letters to Adam, that

1410
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:20,790
he has to read on the next show.
Horrible letters. But if you

1411
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:24,090
take that line of thinking and
take it to its logical extreme,

1412
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:25,800
Iran is not involved.

1413
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:29,970
Adam Curry: Very possible, very
possible, and Hezbollah

1414
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:32,580
John C Dvorak: won't come down.
I mean, we already played the

1415
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:35,700
clips from the last show on that
on the Hezbollah's as presented

1416
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:39,600
by LG zero, which is a
representative cutter. So you're

1417
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,510
gonna get something that's, you
know, cutter, and these other

1418
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:45,720
Arab niches don't want to make
this into a big deal because

1419
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:51,540
they're gonna get killed. And so
the Israelis have shot into

1420
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:56,610
Lebanon from that area where
Hezbollah would come in, and

1421
01:21:56,610 --> 01:21:58,380
there's no evidence that they're
going to come in and they

1422
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,340
probably won't.

1423
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,040
Adam Curry: They don't have to,
for us to go bomb them.

1424
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:06,000
John C Dvorak: Don't have to not
if you got Lindsey Graham,

1425
01:22:06,030 --> 01:22:10,260
Adam Curry: that's you got him
on your side. So I my my eyes

1426
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:15,840
are on schema Bresler. She's,
it's baffling, baffling, that

1427
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:21,210
they pull this physical partisan
particle physicist from CERN

1428
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:24,810
into this and she becomes this
hero. I mean, I'm almost

1429
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:28,860
thinking, Is she going to be the
next prime minister? Do we have

1430
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,810
a new goldmine? Err on our
hands?

1431
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:33,720
John C Dvorak: Who is this
woman? I'm looking at her wiki

1432
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:37,980
page. I've looked at looked her
up. Who is she? Who is behind

1433
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:41,040
her? You don't she didn't do
this on her own. I don't care

1434
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,720
what anybody would like to
think.

1435
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:46,050
Adam Curry: Well, she's at the
Weitzman Institute of Science.

1436
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:53,910
And I've been searching to find
out I mean, she was married to

1437
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:58,680
the guide died. Eight ton vert
Heimer, which I haven't, it's

1438
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:03,750
very hard to find information on
her. She's in that regard. It

1439
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:06,780
was a little like, huh, let me
see. You billionaire

1440
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:11,250
businessman. Okay. He was one of
Israel's wealthiest men. Okay,

1441
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:20,880
here we go. He died in 2022. Did
he? Seven years old. One of

1442
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,480
Israel's wealthiest men after us
tycoon Warren Buffett bought a

1443
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:28,530
controlling share in his
company. Oh, now this makes for

1444
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:29,580
a little more interesting.

1445
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:33,360
John C Dvorak: Read on

1446
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:35,640
Adam Curry: as a philanthropist
Wertheimer was an ardent

1447
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:38,640
supporter of Israeli Palestinian
businesses and peace

1448
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:42,750
initiatives. He founded Erez
college in the northern town of

1449
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:46,590
Shlomi and the experimental
school of toughen industrial

1450
01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:53,820
park that's all I have on this
particular article. So she is a

1451
01:23:53,820 --> 01:24:00,330
probably loaded and she comes
from the fear in urine you're on

1452
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:05,490
that level. Then you know you've
got you're connected. She just

1453
01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:12,150
connected she's connected. Me
see this car metalworking sold

1454
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:18,630
it to Buffett for 6 billion.
Hmm, I don't know. What is this?

1455
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,500
Oh, he was an IDF. I know that.
I mean, this is where I got

1456
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:26,670
stuck. This is this is what you
look at Chick Ma. M she's got

1457
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:30,420
leader written all over her. Neo
lib tard leader but she's got

1458
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:30,840
leader

1459
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:35,580
John C Dvorak: reminding me
because of the nature of the

1460
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:36,570
jobs woman.

1461
01:24:37,290 --> 01:24:39,570
Adam Curry: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1462
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,840
John C Dvorak: You know, he's
got a wife and Lauren. Lauren.

1463
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:43,920
Adam Curry: Lauren. What's

1464
01:24:44,099 --> 01:24:45,179
John C Dvorak: your jobs?

1465
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,790
Adam Curry: Lawrence? Their
middle name. That's important.

1466
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:47,970
We

1467
01:24:48,809 --> 01:24:52,529
John C Dvorak: forgot anyway,
she ends up inheriting Disney.

1468
01:24:52,529 --> 01:24:56,069
She basically runs she owns the
Disney Corporation for all

1469
01:24:56,069 --> 01:24:59,819
practical purposes, the major
shareholder, and all this other

1470
01:24:59,819 --> 01:25:05,039
end Just nothing but money and
and stock. And she's I don't

1471
01:25:05,039 --> 01:25:08,819
know what her background is but
she was she Powell Jobs Lauren

1472
01:25:08,819 --> 01:25:14,699
Powell Yeah. Lauren Lauren
Powell Jobs. She was she's super

1473
01:25:14,759 --> 01:25:18,989
ultra super, I would say naive
liberal. And she puts all her

1474
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:21,839
money toward liberal causes and
pushes things in that direction,

1475
01:25:21,839 --> 01:25:24,539
which is nothing jobs would have
done this is interesting.

1476
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:28,380
Adam Curry: March 23 2020, stays
around the same time this

1477
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:31,560
interview the same month of the
change of the technology

1478
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,230
Bressler was detained by police
during one of the many Dave

1479
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:37,860
disruption protests held across
Israel, Israel. She was later

1480
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:40,920
released former minute Prime
Minister and protest leader Ehud

1481
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:46,770
Barak, part of the West exec
lobbying firm that brought in

1482
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,860
the new software tweeted the
Breathless arrest was

1483
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:54,540
dictatorship and action. There's
too many connections here. I

1484
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:59,670
mean, I'm just I need some red
yarn, people. I need to connect

1485
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:00,630
this on my wall.

1486
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:05,820
John C Dvorak: So we've got
plenty of Arabs that listen to

1487
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:10,050
the show. There are plenty of
spooks that listen to the show.

1488
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:13,590
I'm sure plenty of military guys
to listen to the show. Can

1489
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:20,490
someone share? Share besides
Seymour Hersh, who probably is

1490
01:26:20,490 --> 01:26:25,800
digging into his into this as we
speak? Yeah, I think there's

1491
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,830
something going on. As

1492
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:35,700
Adam Curry: as usual. As usual,
yes. Then, of course, here in

1493
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:40,530
the United States, everyone
loses their crap. And it's very

1494
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:43,770
similar. What happened here,
particularly amongst the

1495
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:49,920
universities was interesting.
There is such a I mean, everyone

1496
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,320
jumping on the end, it's all
around the world actually.

1497
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:55,980
Jumping on the pro Palestine
where is Roger Waters I keep

1498
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:59,160
waiting for him to leave. He's
the guy that's always been anti

1499
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:05,910
Israel Pro. You know, boycott
divest and been another be Meo.

1500
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:09,480
Why Why don't the interview him?
It's the guy I want to hear from

1501
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:12,150
right now. I want to hear what
he thinks.

1502
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:15,420
John C Dvorak: Yeah, well, it'd
be nice. I have two clips I want

1503
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:19,800
to play. This is about US
citizens stuck in Gaza. And the

1504
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,930
reason I want to play these two
clips because there's a kicker

1505
01:27:21,930 --> 01:27:22,860
at the end a clip to

1506
01:27:23,010 --> 01:27:25,470
Unknown: the State Department
says the number of US citizens

1507
01:27:25,470 --> 01:27:29,790
killed in the Hamas attack on
Israel has risen to at least 29

1508
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:33,420
with 15 people listed as
missing. This is Israel prepares

1509
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:36,690
for unexpected ground incursion
into Gaza, as dozens of

1510
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:40,350
Americans there are trying to
get out. They had hoped to

1511
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:43,890
evacuate today, but they along
with more than 2 million Gazans

1512
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:47,820
without us passports remain
trapped. Israel has imposed a

1513
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:51,750
complete siege on Gaza, meaning
no people, supplies or food are

1514
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:55,350
allowed to come in or out. And
here's Nina krupinski, has more.

1515
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:59,070
Massachusetts resident of Budo
Cole and his family waited at

1516
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:02,580
the Rafah border crossing for
hours Saturday hoping Egyptian

1517
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:06,450
authorities would open the gate
to let them out. He and other US

1518
01:28:06,450 --> 01:28:09,720
citizens trapped in Gaza were
told by the US State Department

1519
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:13,500
that the gate may open between
noon and 5pm local time that

1520
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,740
window has passed and the
crossing remains closed. It's

1521
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:19,830
just extremely frustrating. Oh
call his wife and their one year

1522
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:22,350
old baby will spend another
night in Gaza

1523
01:28:23,310 --> 01:28:24,270
Adam Curry: was interesting
little

1524
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:28,200
John C Dvorak: sound. This is
not about Americans in Israel.

1525
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:31,050
This is about him. This whole
piece was about his buck from

1526
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:37,290
NPR by the way. This whole piece
is about Americans in Gaza. Yes.

1527
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:41,910
It was. I guess there's a ton of
them there. And there's a kicker

1528
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:44,130
at the end of this one which had
me somewhat baffled

1529
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:46,680
Unknown: US officials had been
negotiating with Israel and

1530
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,960
Egypt to open the border for
Americans.

1531
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,530
John C Dvorak: For Americans

1532
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:55,410
Adam Curry: Yeah, screw the
screw the power to everybody

1533
01:28:55,410 --> 01:29:00,300
John C Dvorak: else, which which
is a sign of our as a nation of

1534
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:05,670
our empire. And our empathy. The
well they empathy screw that we

1535
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:10,650
have empire and it's like you
got that border down there. Open

1536
01:29:10,650 --> 01:29:16,740
it up for Americans Yeah. You
can be sure that we're putting

1537
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:19,830
pressure on the Egyptian
Government to open that Southern

1538
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:28,110
crossing that southern accent
from Gaza for Americans let them

1539
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:30,390
get let our Americans get out
and then you get bombed you

1540
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:31,080
humbled Hold on.

1541
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:33,750
Adam Curry: That will in fact
well as we heard from Lindsey

1542
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:36,930
Graham is going to be slitting
throats. Americans throats will

1543
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:42,120
be slit an escalation of the
violence and escalation anyway

1544
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:45,840
so back back at home man you
probably people in America

1545
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:49,860
probably heard about the
university signing statements

1546
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:56,820
and me oh we hate Israel. We're
all pro pro Palestinian cuz it's

1547
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:59,370
crazy. Here's something from ABC
Mrs. from Boston

1548
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,860
Unknown: digital billboard
parked right outside Harvard

1549
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:04,950
University is attracting a lot
of attention. The names and

1550
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:09,000
faces of Harvard students, which
we have blurred are displayed

1551
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,210
under the title Harvard's
leading anti Semites. The

1552
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:15,210
students are allegedly those who
signed on to a statement by the

1553
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:18,480
student group Palestine
Solidarity Committee, which read

1554
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:22,800
in part, we hold the Israeli
regime entirely responsible for

1555
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,920
all unfolding violence, we're
merely amplifying their message.

1556
01:30:25,950 --> 01:30:28,800
The man claiming responsibility
for the truck says the Harvard

1557
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,170
community should know who the
students are, if

1558
01:30:31,170 --> 01:30:33,600
they're ashamed of what they did
and want to apologize, we'll

1559
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,090
remove them. If they're proud of
what they did. They should thank

1560
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:36,660
us don't

1561
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:39,690
put these people on this screen
because it puts them in danger.

1562
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:42,540
But students like Jeremy
Ornstein believe the trucks

1563
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:45,930
message is only Adding to the
tension on campus, Harvard Hillo

1564
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:48,090
has already condemned this, the
Jews of Harvard have already

1565
01:30:48,090 --> 01:30:50,340
condemned this and make clear it
doesn't bring anything to the

1566
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:53,370
discussion. And it actually
brings greater harm and danger

1567
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:54,690
to a lot of human beings who

1568
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:58,080
are here at Harvard University
increasing patrols in light of

1569
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:01,320
the divide in an email to
students, the school says we do

1570
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:04,140
not condone or ignore
intimidation, we do not condone

1571
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:07,230
or ignore threats or acts of
harassment or violence.

1572
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:09,570
I know some of the fellow
students on this camp on this

1573
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:12,270
campus. And it just hurts my
heart. Just see my fellow

1574
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:14,790
friends going through this when
they're just standing up for

1575
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:15,540
what they believe that

1576
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:19,230
this issue is very sensitive.
And this is a very insensitive

1577
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,330
way to portray these Harvard
students.

1578
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,970
Adam Curry: I don't believe I
don't believe this for a second

1579
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:27,360
that these people these anybody
certainly in the United States,

1580
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:31,230
certainly not at University has
any context any knowledge, any

1581
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:34,170
historical background in in what
is happening.

1582
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,840
John C Dvorak: Yes, particularly
that particular group was

1583
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:40,320
exposed by a couple of
documentaries that there's two

1584
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:43,800
groups and they're in they're
paid directly from that 100

1585
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:48,420
million dollar slush fund from
Iran. And they are I think

1586
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:51,480
there's 300 of them in the
country at different

1587
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:57,360
universities including Cal
Berkeley, and it they I don't

1588
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:00,270
know whether they know anything
or not but they are paid to do

1589
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:01,470
this and that's what they're
doing

1590
01:32:01,530 --> 01:32:04,530
Adam Curry: and what happens is
just like Black Lives Matter

1591
01:32:04,530 --> 01:32:07,620
without thought without
investigation without any

1592
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:12,060
critical analysis. Oh, I better
do it. I better do what everyone

1593
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:18,210
else is doing. You know, I bet
this is the problem. Oh Rob, you

1594
01:32:18,210 --> 01:32:21,630
know it looks like everyone is
off I bet I don't want to be the

1595
01:32:21,630 --> 01:32:25,680
guy on the on the wrong side of
this argument then everyone's Oh

1596
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:33,150
yeah. No classes let's go No,
but that's that's really what's

1597
01:32:33,150 --> 01:32:38,730
happened these are sadly our our
higher education institutions

1598
01:32:38,730 --> 01:32:39,360
have become a

1599
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,130
John C Dvorak: well it's a
higher educate the higher

1600
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:43,860
educated you get the more
boosters you get to so I don't

1601
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:46,320
know if that tells you anything.
Yeah, I do have one more

1602
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:51,270
Palestine clip. I want to play
more boosters, more boosters

1603
01:32:51,270 --> 01:32:56,820
more as you get a PhD, you get
all of them. Okay. Speaking of

1604
01:32:56,820 --> 01:33:00,930
PhDs, but first let's play
Palestine update. Okay.

1605
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:03,510
Unknown: The day old truce
between Israel and Hamas

1606
01:33:03,510 --> 01:33:07,890
militants appears to be holding
after 11 days of fighting. Egypt

1607
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:11,400
has provided a delegation to
Israel in an effort to shore up

1608
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:15,720
the truce. Martin Indyk is a
former US Special Envoy for

1609
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:18,870
Israeli Palestinian
negotiations. Now with the

1610
01:33:18,870 --> 01:33:23,490
Council on Foreign Relations.
He's not sure either

1611
01:33:23,490 --> 01:33:26,340
Adam Curry: party really wants
Oh, did you edit that in?

1612
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:34,770
Unknown: Now with the Council on
Foreign Relations, he's not sure

1613
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,050
either party really wants a
peace deal.

1614
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:40,710
on the Palestinian side. It's
very hard to see how we could

1615
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:44,070
work towards a final status
agreement and on the Israeli

1616
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:47,850
side. There looks like they're
going into a fifth election.

1617
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:51,450
They have a caretaker
government. Netanyahu was trying

1618
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:51,510
to

1619
01:33:52,469 --> 01:33:55,679
John C Dvorak: stop the clip.
Oh, I'm sorry. This is a two

1620
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:59,879
year old. I accidentally got put
into my pile.

1621
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:04,110
Adam Curry: An old classic no
agenda gag. You got me. You got

1622
01:34:04,110 --> 01:34:05,760
me. You got me. You got me.

1623
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:12,600
John C Dvorak: All right. Yes,
this is from May 2020. Yeah, I'm

1624
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:13,800
sorry. I apologize.

1625
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:16,350
Adam Curry: In an odd way. I
just want to play two more clips

1626
01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:18,990
and then we need to talk about
higher education and PhDs.

1627
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:26,280
There's this woman Esther
Perell. And she is she has an

1628
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:34,500
actual title here homeless
seconds. She is here we go. Also

1629
01:34:34,530 --> 01:34:37,890
younger than she sounds that
she's Belgian American

1630
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:43,470
psychotherapist known for her
work on human relationships. And

1631
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:48,450
she sounds kind of like a woowoo
person you have to Oprah. Oprah

1632
01:34:48,450 --> 01:34:52,860
loves her. But she attended the
Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

1633
01:34:54,690 --> 01:34:58,710
And she's another cutie she
could also have she could be in

1634
01:34:58,710 --> 01:34:59,970
that in that girl.

1635
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,250
John C Dvorak: Amen. You're on
to the Jewish cuties today,

1636
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:05,970
Adam Curry: well she's not who
she Jewish. Yes. Oh, she's the

1637
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,040
daughter of two Polish Jewish
Holocaust survivors. I must have

1638
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:15,240
been. Okay. All right. So she
shows up on my favorite hate

1639
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:15,990
lists and pivot,

1640
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:17,730
John C Dvorak: which she lists
her name again.

1641
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:23,430
Adam Curry: Esther Perell, p e r
e, l, okay. And she shows up on

1642
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:28,230
Pivot, my favorite hate listen.
And she has a concept which I

1643
01:35:28,230 --> 01:35:33,900
kind of like, which is AI is
artificial intimacy. Which I

1644
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:37,560
liked, I liked I thought it was
it was a good guy. And so I want

1645
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,930
to first a minute on the
artificial intimacy. And then

1646
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:42,450
the clip that I think is
pertinent to what's happening in

1647
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:43,440
the universities and

1648
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:47,160
Unknown: modern loneliness. The
masks itself has hyper

1649
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:53,190
connectivity. And so people have
easily 1000 virtual friends that

1650
01:35:53,190 --> 01:35:57,810
no one can ask to feed their
cat. And that loneliness that is

1651
01:35:57,810 --> 01:36:02,790
really a kind of depletion of
the social capital is extremely

1652
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:06,720
powerful. It's more to men than
to women, but it's quite

1653
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:10,080
generous. It's very important.
I've been very interested in

1654
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:13,260
talking about modern loneliness
as it connects to the rise of

1655
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:17,130
the other AI, artificial
intimacy. How often do you find

1656
01:36:17,130 --> 01:36:20,280
yourself working the whole day
on your laptop, then you can't

1657
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:23,160
wait to close the screen, then
you go home, but you're too

1658
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:26,400
tired. And all you do is watch
TV. Then while you watch TV,

1659
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:28,590
you're also scrolling on your
phone. Then while you're

1660
01:36:28,590 --> 01:36:30,810
scrolling on your phone, you
lift your head and you see that

1661
01:36:30,810 --> 01:36:34,380
two people in the room are doing
the exact same thing. This is

1662
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:37,800
modern loneliness. This is
artificial intimacy. I am there

1663
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:41,040
but I am not present. And then I
talk to you about something that

1664
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,560
really matters to me. And your
answer goes.

1665
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:48,270
Adam Curry: Uh huh. Uh huh. All
right. So again, you don't

1666
01:36:48,270 --> 01:36:50,730
criticize don't criticize yet
because it's

1667
01:36:51,090 --> 01:36:53,790
John C Dvorak: your lead me and
you're leading me into two

1668
01:36:53,790 --> 01:36:54,570
clips.

1669
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:58,380
Adam Curry: Good. We'll get to
that in a moment. So this is the

1670
01:36:58,620 --> 01:37:02,100
second and only other clip. So
as it pertains to what by

1671
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:05,250
John C Dvorak: the way, stop.
She's You said she sounds

1672
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:09,570
younger. Yo, sounds good. She's
65 She's not a young woman.

1673
01:37:10,559 --> 01:37:13,499
Adam Curry: Really? And the
unreal wiki page she she doesn't

1674
01:37:13,499 --> 01:37:19,409
I didn't look at her age really?
Now, let me say she is it right.

1675
01:37:20,069 --> 01:37:24,269
Now. She looks good. Then for 60
Oh, I just zoomed in okay to now

1676
01:37:24,269 --> 01:37:25,799
she looks like Victoria knew she
looks

1677
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,420
John C Dvorak: like she's 65 It
looks like

1678
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,920
Adam Curry: I really need to
click on those pictures. You

1679
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:32,250
gotta

1680
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:32,820
John C Dvorak: yet get

1681
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:41,460
Adam Curry: busted. Okay.
Anyway. So this next clip, this

1682
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:44,670
whole the whole thing was
because Kara and Scott, you

1683
01:37:44,670 --> 01:37:52,830
know, it's so difficult to talk
about the conflict and and she

1684
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:57,150
brings in a little bit here
about you know, because of

1685
01:37:57,150 --> 01:37:59,820
course, you know, no one can
sleep you're scrolling all these

1686
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:03,900
pictures is very bad for you
artificial and intimacy. And

1687
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:07,050
then she drops this little
nugget, which to me explains

1688
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:10,350
exactly why you're seeing
protests, which I think are

1689
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:15,480
completely disingenuous. It's
just, let's just be for

1690
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:19,140
something that everybody else is
for the new new things

1691
01:38:19,170 --> 01:38:22,320
Unknown: is changing something
in the world, not just in the

1692
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,320
Middle East, the 10, it's not
sure that the image is really

1693
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:27,930
the right image. And it really
tells the story that it pretends

1694
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:33,210
to tell it's a total mindfuck.
There is, it's a little bit like

1695
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:37,590
911, with 10 people titrate,
don't just watch it over and

1696
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:41,850
over again, you will not sleep,
you literally will not sleep, I

1697
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:45,840
am not sleeping. And I didn't
watch much. I just talked to

1698
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:49,680
people. And that's enough. So
what you do after that, when you

1699
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:53,580
feel like the tide is rising
inside of you. And you just feel

1700
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:57,120
like you don't know what to do
with all of this is the most

1701
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:59,940
important thing is to come
together with others to

1702
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:04,200
experience collective trauma
collectively, to understand that

1703
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:07,740
this is changing something in
the world, not just in the

1704
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:13,110
Middle East, and to read poetry,
to talk about what's happened to

1705
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:16,740
ask people where they are. I
think ally ship is extremely

1706
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:20,040
important in a moment like this.
And all of those who missed the

1707
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:23,370
ally ship of Black Lives Matter
will understand it even more. So

1708
01:39:23,370 --> 01:39:27,570
now that when somebody writes to
you just to say, I know you have

1709
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:30,780
an attachment to that place, or
I know you know people there or

1710
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:34,950
I know you know if you were
there recently or something that

1711
01:39:34,950 --> 01:39:39,450
says I know I see you there's
nothing else for me to say and

1712
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:43,830
you answer this means a lot you
thought of me I exist in your

1713
01:39:43,830 --> 01:39:47,040
collective awareness and that is
a lot

1714
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:52,200
Adam Curry: over socialized
under under educated ally ship

1715
01:39:52,290 --> 01:39:54,510
needing nut jobs.

1716
01:39:55,290 --> 01:39:58,200
John C Dvorak: That's what I
think you've been on that for a

1717
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:00,450
while. I think you're right but
where did you get This

1718
01:40:01,589 --> 01:40:06,389
Adam Curry: Pro I told you from
pivot when? Friday

1719
01:40:07,139 --> 01:40:12,089
John C Dvorak: this is an up so
why do I say that?

1720
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:14,850
Adam Curry: Why do Why do you
say that? What do you say? It's

1721
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:15,720
not because

1722
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:19,530
John C Dvorak: they just ran it
lowliness bit. Yeah, you know a

1723
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:25,920
complete feature on NPR.
Loneliness. Yeah, I just picked

1724
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,330
it up on Friday.

1725
01:40:27,450 --> 01:40:37,260
Adam Curry: Ah another up
uncovered. Wow. Okay, is I

1726
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:38,070
played these clips.

1727
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:41,340
John C Dvorak: Yeah, let's go
loneliness one NPR, the United

1728
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:44,760
States is experiencing an
epidemic of loneliness WoW

1729
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:47,160
Report from the US Surgeon
General says about half of

1730
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:49,890
adults claim they have
experienced loneliness.

1731
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:52,920
Unknown: So for some advice on
how to make friends, we turn to

1732
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:54,180
some young experts.

1733
01:40:54,330 --> 01:40:59,790
I make friends by sitting next
to them at lunch or in a class.

1734
01:40:59,850 --> 01:41:01,560
Adam Curry: Where is this person
12.

1735
01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:03,990
John C Dvorak: More like eight,

1736
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:08,340
Unknown: it's a little hard in a
little easy. You could play with

1737
01:41:08,370 --> 01:41:10,200
them or they can play with you

1738
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:12,150
John C Dvorak: stop right there.
You know, now, as you mentioned

1739
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:15,780
that they use these kids as
foils for this for this feature

1740
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:18,420
that they're doing on
loneliness. And I'm thinking

1741
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:22,290
that they're kind of put in the
position where they have to do

1742
01:41:22,290 --> 01:41:25,500
this because there's some op
going on about loneliness, John,

1743
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:25,980
we get

1744
01:41:26,010 --> 01:41:28,830
Adam Curry: our producers to
have their children say the most

1745
01:41:28,830 --> 01:41:33,390
horrible things I know. I mean,
you can get the kids to say

1746
01:41:33,390 --> 01:41:34,110
anything.

1747
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:36,300
John C Dvorak: Right. But so
they put these kids because I

1748
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:39,150
think they're trying to push
back against the app. But oh,

1749
01:41:39,150 --> 01:41:40,110
let's continue

1750
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:45,210
Unknown: friends by sitting next
to them at lunch or in a class.

1751
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:49,980
It's a little hard and a little
easy. You could play with them

1752
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:51,510
or they can play with you.

1753
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:54,000
Adam Curry: According to the
troll room. Bill Maher also

1754
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:59,160
talked about loneliness epidemic
on his show on Friday on Friday.

1755
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:03,480
Hey, everybody, we dropped the
OP on Friday.

1756
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:07,860
John C Dvorak: And Friday was
the day of the of the 13th the

1757
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:11,250
raid global day every day. Ah,

1758
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:15,720
Unknown: so you should ask them
nicely. Try to be nice, because

1759
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:19,680
usually people don't want to be
your friends. If you're mean to

1760
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:21,030
them. Oh, that's

1761
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:24,900
Liliana Beckwith Collins a dusky
and Liliana is brother, Owen

1762
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:28,980
Beckwith. The fear of rejection
sometimes holds people back from

1763
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:30,000
making friends.

1764
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:32,880
When you assume people like you,
you are friendlier, you are

1765
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,370
warmer, you're more open, you
take more initiative,

1766
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:38,760
that is University of Maryland
psychologist Marisa Franco.

1767
01:42:38,910 --> 01:42:42,180
She's the author of Platonic how
the science of attachment can

1768
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:46,020
help you make and keep friends.
And she says, paying attention

1769
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:47,580
to people can help you connect
with them.

1770
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:52,020
Adam Curry: Wow, do they at any
point say if an older person

1771
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:54,450
comes to you, you can trust them
to be your friend.

1772
01:42:56,130 --> 01:42:59,100
John C Dvorak: No idea what the
point of this op is. But the

1773
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:02,580
fact that we have three things
going on simultaneously on the

1774
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:04,860
same day, which you'd think
they'd spread it out a little

1775
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:08,310
bit. I know, it's very
suspicious. Now that they kind

1776
01:43:08,310 --> 01:43:10,980
of demeaned the whole thing here
on this NPR report. But in the

1777
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:16,020
second half, it's kind of the
second clip. It's kind of funny

1778
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:20,460
because the woman who's doing
the Who's, who's the presenter

1779
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:25,320
has to demean herself I think at
the very end and the whole thing

1780
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:28,380
I believe falls apart, but you
know, it continues.

1781
01:43:28,770 --> 01:43:32,010
Unknown: If you're just like,
present, and you're just like

1782
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:37,290
interested in people like That's
enough, you don't have to charm

1783
01:43:37,290 --> 01:43:38,130
people.

1784
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:42,120
Having someone to confide in can
also affect the way your body

1785
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:45,450
deals with stressful situations.
Research shows strong social

1786
01:43:45,450 --> 01:43:48,360
connections can reduce the risk
of heart disease dementia and

1787
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:51,570
improve your overall well being.
Yeah, just as four year old

1788
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:56,310
Edith wintech when I'm with my
friend and makes me feel happy.

1789
01:43:57,030 --> 01:44:01,860
Okay, so a you don't have any
trouble making friends. Am I

1790
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:02,340
right?

1791
01:44:02,370 --> 01:44:06,720
No, I do because I don't want
any new friends. I describe

1792
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:10,590
myself as friendly not social.
So in order to make new friends

1793
01:44:10,590 --> 01:44:13,410
you kind of have to be social
and I don't want to do that.

1794
01:44:14,130 --> 01:44:15,360
So can I be your friend?

1795
01:44:16,140 --> 01:44:20,070
I thought we were what do you do
audition now is

1796
01:44:20,070 --> 01:44:24,660
just checking I was just making
sure because you know we're all

1797
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:25,470
we're both nice

1798
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:28,890
Adam Curry: this is this has got
to be binary is this something

1799
01:44:28,890 --> 01:44:30,120
else coming to this

1800
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:32,700
John C Dvorak: I believe I
believe you're right something's

1801
01:44:32,730 --> 01:44:36,960
up there How about a new dr.
strange and by the way I was

1802
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:40,620
gonna be a good lead into the no
agenda meetup section because

1803
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:42,900
into this a you have you have
you start making new friends you

1804
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:43,890
you're happier. This

1805
01:44:43,890 --> 01:44:46,740
Adam Curry: is correct. And I
was planning on doing that

1806
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:49,890
because well I will do it again.
But before we even get to the

1807
01:44:49,890 --> 01:44:55,440
meet up section, we need to talk
about the PhD.

1808
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:58,350
John C Dvorak: Yes, here's my
here's what we're doing for the

1809
01:44:58,350 --> 01:45:02,190
CIT show. 16 103 Through the
16th anniversary, and probably

1810
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:02,580
and I

1811
01:45:03,450 --> 01:45:06,720
Adam Curry: don't even know the
entire deal here. So this is new

1812
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:07,740
for me is we're gonna you

1813
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:09,720
John C Dvorak: know, most you
know, 99% of it,

1814
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:11,280
Adam Curry: I'd say 80%

1815
01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:15,030
John C Dvorak: We're going to do
a no agenda is going to be

1816
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:20,220
certificated and recorded, put
on a website, and we're not

1817
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:22,710
going to do it forever, we're
going to do it for a month, at

1818
01:45:22,710 --> 01:45:26,310
most, because this work that Jay
is going to have to do.

1819
01:45:27,750 --> 01:45:29,490
Adam Curry: Talking about
getting your kids to do

1820
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:30,750
something nice, and

1821
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:32,910
John C Dvorak: she's going to
charge us for it. So it's gonna

1822
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:39,840
be Oh, it's not frozen. So not
so funny is so we're going to

1823
01:45:39,870 --> 01:45:45,090
grant the show itself is going
to grant a PhD in media

1824
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:49,980
deconstruction. And we're going
to do it in a in a in a, in a

1825
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:53,700
way it's done it. Everyone does
it the same way by charging you

1826
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:54,330
money.

1827
01:45:55,980 --> 01:45:58,650
Adam Curry: Just like a reel of
institutions, just like a real

1828
01:45:58,650 --> 01:46:03,540
college, will it be $500,000 for
a four year education, which

1829
01:46:03,570 --> 01:46:06,390
John C Dvorak: is by is a
bargain by comparison is going

1830
01:46:06,390 --> 01:46:11,010
to be $1,000. It's not a
cumulative bull thing. It's

1831
01:46:11,010 --> 01:46:14,880
$1,000. Straight up, you will
get a knighthood and an

1832
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:18,150
executive producer, but it's not
that you can say well, I've

1833
01:46:18,150 --> 01:46:21,120
already contributed 500 to my
knighthood, here's 500 Give

1834
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:23,730
Adam Curry: me let me let me ask
you a question. Can you name

1835
01:46:23,730 --> 01:46:27,210
your doc Can you say I'm now a
doctor of deconstruction? Or can

1836
01:46:27,210 --> 01:46:29,520
you say I'm a Doctor of
something else? Do you get to

1837
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,830
name your your PhD or your
field?

1838
01:46:31,830 --> 01:46:33,900
John C Dvorak: You You can do
whatever you want. Now, on the

1839
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:39,030
PhD it says Doctor philosophy
for Media Studies. Exactly. You

1840
01:46:39,030 --> 01:46:42,300
would if you put it on the wall,
it would pass by and say

1841
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:44,730
Adam Curry: you have oh, you
have a you have a p at European

1842
01:46:44,730 --> 01:46:49,500
HD? Yeah. Is it just as valid as
any other PhD?

1843
01:46:50,370 --> 01:46:51,990
John C Dvorak: depends on your
perspective?

1844
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:55,350
Adam Curry: Okay, like, like a
knighthood or an executive

1845
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:56,100
producer ship?

1846
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:58,890
John C Dvorak: Yeah, was
definitely as valuable as a

1847
01:46:58,890 --> 01:47:02,520
knighthood. Is it as $1,000
Straight up, that's it. It's not

1848
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:07,830
$1,000 plus or minus anything?
$1,000 or more, you get a

1849
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:11,400
knighthood, a PhD and an
executive producer ship all in

1850
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:11,760
one.

1851
01:47:11,790 --> 01:47:17,310
Adam Curry: Let's put this just
as valid as Joe Biden's PhD. Am

1852
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:17,880
I right?

1853
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:20,100
John C Dvorak: As far as I'm
concerned.

1854
01:47:20,820 --> 01:47:23,820
Adam Curry: All right. And when
we kick this off on the next

1855
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:26,340
show on 1600 are on Yeah, we
kick

1856
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:27,990
John C Dvorak: it off, or you
can kick it off. Now actually,

1857
01:47:27,990 --> 01:47:31,980
today, we have a high donation
of 3000. And this person will

1858
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:36,090
retroactively if he wants the,
if he wants to PhD, we'll give

1859
01:47:36,090 --> 01:47:39,120
it to him because it would be
unfair to not give it to

1860
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:42,810
somebody who donated that much
the day before we announced the

1861
01:47:42,810 --> 01:47:45,870
donations. So that's a
retroactive when we can do that.

1862
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:49,350
But from from now on, it's
$1,000 that's what it's gonna

1863
01:47:49,350 --> 01:47:52,680
cost we figure I figure we'll
get 10 or 20 people to do

1864
01:47:52,710 --> 01:47:55,440
Adam Curry: i mean i i spent
three months in college I have

1865
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:58,620
nothing to show for it. It's you
will have a PhD and a hoodie and

1866
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:00,660
I will not have a PhD you know
what I'm gonna

1867
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:02,940
John C Dvorak: wait wait if you
give $1,000

1868
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:05,280
Adam Curry: DON I want

1869
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:09,570
John C Dvorak: you get a PhD as
because you're signing the beard

1870
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:10,710
your signatures on

1871
01:48:12,390 --> 01:48:14,550
Adam Curry: that I'd like to
thank you for your courage in

01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:21,240
everything's coming down.
Everything's gonna

1890
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:24,960
John C Dvorak: stay good. Yeah.
Yeah, that guy has sent a note

1891
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:28,980
to the hamburger place owners
gonna have to meet up Yeah. Do

1892
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:30,600
you have his email? Should we
Doc's him?

1893
01:49:30,990 --> 01:49:36,000
Adam Curry: No, no, in fact, I
emailed him you want to know

1894
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,740
what to email me? Yeah. Second.
Yeah. Because I he's because it

1895
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:45,270
came through an email to him.
Where is it here? I think I have

1896
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:53,310
it here. Not going to Doc's.
Anybody you kidding me? Susan

1897
01:49:53,310 --> 01:49:57,540
idea. No, you are you're a
troll. Get in the troll room

1898
01:49:57,540 --> 01:50:04,710
right away. Here it is. I said.
So I forwarded the email that I

1899
01:50:04,710 --> 01:50:08,580
got from the burger joint guy.
And I said to this, Troy said, I

1900
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:12,810
forgive you for doing this. AC
and he replied, Go fuck

1901
01:50:12,810 --> 01:50:18,780
yourself. Okay? That was
basically it. I'm like, No, man,

1902
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:19,380
I forgive me. You

1903
01:50:19,410 --> 01:50:21,930
John C Dvorak: don't want to
Daxing me or use email. No, I've

1904
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:25,350
Adam Curry: when I forgive. I
forgive. It's done. It's um, I'm

1905
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:28,800
not keeping that on me. It's
fine. I'm okay. It's all right.

1906
01:50:28,830 --> 01:50:30,210
We know that our bad guy

1907
01:50:30,210 --> 01:50:33,060
John C Dvorak: is a real creep
is really amazing that they find

1908
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:33,720
our show.

1909
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:37,710
Adam Curry: Well, he's, he's got
something stuck in his craw

1910
01:50:37,710 --> 01:50:42,120
about that. What can I tell you?
Anyway? Because I'm sure he'll

1911
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:46,890
be emailing apple and in every
other place like oh, what get

1912
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:51,090
these guys off there homophobes
at transphobes. So that's why

1913
01:50:51,090 --> 01:50:55,950
you want a modern app from
podcast apps.com. And these apps

1914
01:50:55,950 --> 01:50:56,910
also alert us

1915
01:50:56,910 --> 01:50:58,830
John C Dvorak: in the guy had
his nuts cut off.

1916
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:03,660
Adam Curry: When we go live, you
get an alert, you can listen to

1917
01:51:03,660 --> 01:51:06,690
the stream live. It's really
It's quite amazing what we're

1918
01:51:06,690 --> 01:51:10,440
doing over there to podcasting.
2.0 So do that, or just follow

1919
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:14,220
us? By no agenda. social.com
John C. Dvorak. No agenda

1920
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:16,950
social.com. Adam at no agenda
social icon. Well, no, I'm not

1921
01:51:16,950 --> 01:51:20,100
posting anymore. I'm kind of
done. I'm reading I am reading

1922
01:51:20,130 --> 01:51:23,910
but I'm not posting I'll repost
something. Now it's too

1923
01:51:23,910 --> 01:51:26,730
polarized. Everyone's got an
opinion. Everyone's I got no

1924
01:51:26,730 --> 01:51:30,420
time for it. It's just as bad as
any other social network that

1925
01:51:30,420 --> 01:51:35,730
you started it. I did. And now
it's like, it's our home curry.

1926
01:51:36,990 --> 01:51:42,240
What do you think you are? It's
our home. Anything it's becoming

1927
01:51:42,270 --> 01:51:44,160
it's becoming like no agenda
forums?

1928
01:51:45,270 --> 01:51:49,200
John C Dvorak: No, nothing. When
they start starting their own?

1929
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:54,030
No idea. What's it no agenda
social podcast, then? Yeah.

1930
01:51:54,030 --> 01:51:55,320
Okay, then you got some.

1931
01:51:55,590 --> 01:51:59,400
Adam Curry: Now see, that never
works. Because people quickly we

1932
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:03,180
saw that we saw that when it was
like the kind of the anti no

1933
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:06,210
agenda podcast and they couldn't
keep up because it takes a lot

1934
01:52:06,210 --> 01:52:10,320
of work and dedication to do a
show twice a week. And they

1935
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,960
couldn't even deconstruct our
deconstruction, they got tired

1936
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,220
of it. Like

1937
01:52:15,180 --> 01:52:16,830
Unknown: it's too much work too
much

1938
01:52:16,830 --> 01:52:21,810
Adam Curry: work to keep up with
these guys. Now. One of the main

1939
01:52:21,810 --> 01:52:24,330
reasons we're still here 16
years you heard it right there.

1940
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:30,240
Almost 1600 episodes a very
interesting confluence of, of

1941
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:34,710
numbers that cross this month is
because we haven't relied on

1942
01:52:34,710 --> 01:52:37,500
advertising. If we relied on
advertising, sponsorship,

1943
01:52:37,530 --> 01:52:40,020
underwriting, whatever you want
to call it, we would have been

1944
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:43,320
long gone, because it wouldn't
have wouldn't have been able to

1945
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:47,580
sustain ourselves with it, which
we need, then we can't do this

1946
01:52:47,580 --> 01:52:51,690
work as everything full. It's a
full time job. You're always all

1947
01:52:51,690 --> 01:52:54,780
everything we do is prep. Yeah,
go out to dinner with a friend

1948
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:58,590
show prep. Yeah. There's a
there's a, I'm here in

1949
01:52:58,590 --> 01:53:01,710
Fredericksburg, there's an
eclipse show prep. Everything is

1950
01:53:01,710 --> 01:53:05,340
show prep. And then just the
incoming I've been busy, at

1951
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:09,960
least after filtering the 115
emails in the morning. And then

1952
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:13,650
throughout the day, another 100.
And I read it all I read it all

1953
01:53:13,650 --> 01:53:16,470
I have to, because there's
always going to be that one gem

1954
01:53:16,950 --> 01:53:20,490
that you miss if you don't feel
like hey, man, can your

1955
01:53:20,490 --> 01:53:25,800
assistant reply to me? No,
there's no assistant. Donations

1956
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:30,930
are not that good. I wish. I
wish. So we all we asked for his

1957
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:35,640
time, talent, treasure, and we
so appreciate the talent and the

1958
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:39,690
time that people put into making
the show great, such as our

1959
01:53:39,690 --> 01:53:42,930
night Daniel, who does no agenda
meet ups.com now more important

1960
01:53:42,930 --> 01:53:46,020
than ever, as we just heard,
because you need to get rid of

1961
01:53:46,020 --> 01:53:49,110
the artificial intimacy and get
some real intimacy. Look in

1962
01:53:49,110 --> 01:53:52,590
people's eyes when you talk to
them and not have to be worried.

1963
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:54,960
Because even if you have a
completely different opinion

1964
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:57,660
from another no agenda producer,
no one's going to vilify you say

1965
01:53:57,660 --> 01:54:01,110
well, I don't agree with you.
Because we're normal amygdalas

1966
01:54:01,110 --> 01:54:07,350
here, normal size. One of the
great talents that we receive,

1967
01:54:07,770 --> 01:54:10,770
every single show is from our no
agenda artists, we appreciate

1968
01:54:10,770 --> 01:54:15,990
them so much. They do such great
work. And the artwork we had for

1969
01:54:15,990 --> 01:54:20,430
episode 1598 titled that one
guardrails was an anomaly and

1970
01:54:20,430 --> 01:54:23,850
people notice it right away.
They said, Oh my God is like an

1971
01:54:23,850 --> 01:54:28,440
upside down stamp. Curry Dvorak
is not on the artwork, which is

1972
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:32,940
a pretty much a prerequisite.
But we laughed so hard when we

1973
01:54:32,940 --> 01:54:38,880
saw this from Matt Boisvert. We
just had to chuckle when, when

1974
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:44,520
we saw the terror leader one leg
one I missing right here living

1975
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:48,270
in a cave answer to the name of
Lucky foundries.

1976
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:50,850
John C Dvorak: It's an old guy,
right? Have an old joke.

1977
01:54:50,970 --> 01:54:54,990
Adam Curry: It was great. And it
was. I mean, there was one other

1978
01:54:54,990 --> 01:54:56,520
stuff that we Well, I kind of

1979
01:54:56,850 --> 01:54:59,970
John C Dvorak: I want to mention
somebody. We noticed that was

1980
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,780
No, I did that there was no
curry Devorah icon there. So it

1981
01:55:03,780 --> 01:55:07,800
wasn't like it slipped by us. It
was one of those artworks that

1982
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:09,450
we made an exception.

1983
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:13,140
Adam Curry: Yeah, it happens.
Yeah, we make it we make

1984
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:20,820
exceptions. We do the I like the
The Spy Who Loved Iran and which

1985
01:55:21,090 --> 01:55:24,270
I thought was a pretty piece and
you correctly said and by the

1986
01:55:24,270 --> 01:55:27,810
way you can follow along no
agenda art generator.com Dred

1987
01:55:27,810 --> 01:55:31,200
Scott also puts these pieces of
artwork into the show notes so

1988
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:33,570
you can see what we're talking
about. If you look at your

1989
01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:37,650
modern app right now you can see
it in the chapters. And you said

1990
01:55:37,650 --> 01:55:39,990
correctly Well, if you don't
really know what's going on just

1991
01:55:39,990 --> 01:55:44,490
looks like a James Bond on LSD.
I'm like, Yeah, okay. It was

1992
01:55:44,490 --> 01:55:48,780
pretty though. But it wasn't as
funny as the terror leader. You

1993
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:53,250
know, we're not going to do
Stars of David you know, what

1994
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:59,280
else the you use it for the
newsletter the peanuts

1995
01:56:00,390 --> 01:56:03,270
John C Dvorak: that I did? I
thought you did. Yeah. Yeah, I

1996
01:56:03,270 --> 01:56:06,660
didn't use that penis. Ah, why
do I have the newsletter? I

1997
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:09,990
think I can tell you what I use.
No, I use the the

1998
01:56:10,050 --> 01:56:12,990
Adam Curry: the yes, the P of
war calendar. You laugh? Yes.

1999
01:56:13,410 --> 01:56:16,740
Yeah. But I look at that and
like that's it was commerce or

2000
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:20,130
blog or AI generated so not
stolen? Totally stolen. That

2001
01:56:20,130 --> 01:56:21,450
I've seen that from that's

2002
01:56:21,450 --> 01:56:23,880
John C Dvorak: totally stolen. I
don't care if it's aaj if you

2003
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:28,080
can generate Peanuts characters.
That's a copyright viral

2004
01:56:28,110 --> 01:56:32,070
violation. I don't care if it's
done by AI. But it's that stolen

2005
01:56:32,070 --> 01:56:35,460
art that is never going to get
used You thief.

2006
01:56:37,410 --> 01:56:43,260
Adam Curry: Oh, the so the the
faux diddly had a do the math.

2007
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:46,590
And I actually sat with a
calculator and we're trying to

2008
01:56:46,590 --> 01:56:47,460
figure out

2009
01:56:47,639 --> 01:56:49,769
John C Dvorak: like oh no, we
gave up after two rounds.

2010
01:56:50,249 --> 01:56:51,659
Attempts. It's like

2011
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:54,900
Adam Curry: I can't this what is
this artwork about what? I'm

2012
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:57,480
hoping 33 pops out somewhere but
no.

2013
01:56:57,900 --> 01:57:00,540
John C Dvorak: So that was my if
you do do whatever he wants to

2014
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:00,930
do, I'm

2015
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:02,250
Adam Curry: not sure I don't
know how to do

2016
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:04,530
John C Dvorak: it. Right
numerological tricks

2017
01:57:04,530 --> 01:57:09,300
Adam Curry: every odd it didn't
work at all for us the math yeah

2018
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:12,300
so and there were other good
looking pieces for sure. Good

2019
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:17,220
looking pieces. But nothing
quite like the terror leader who

2020
01:57:17,220 --> 01:57:19,830
we have who has not emerged as a
meme yet so maybe

2021
01:57:19,830 --> 01:57:21,750
John C Dvorak: we it's possible
that you're all you're going to

2022
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:23,220
be wrong on this one I might be

2023
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:28,170
Adam Curry: Yeah, Muhammad de F
it's the right kind of guy but

2024
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:28,500
now

2025
01:57:28,769 --> 01:57:30,989
John C Dvorak: he's got all the
he's got the all the elements

2026
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:34,620
Adam Curry: He's got everything
we need he's we don't know where

2027
01:57:34,620 --> 01:57:39,810
he lives. Got one I missing a
leg. I am this perfect. But no.

2028
01:57:40,350 --> 01:57:41,820
So far no good.

2029
01:57:43,980 --> 01:57:45,990
John C Dvorak: Again, we're so
far ahead of the game on this

2030
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:48,120
deconstruction stuff that we can
do

2031
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:50,550
Adam Curry: months from now does
happen it does happen so thank

2032
01:57:50,550 --> 01:57:55,200
you very much. Matt for Matt
boys word for boys. Ver I wonder

2033
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:58,050
how you pronounce it. We really
appreciate the work of all of

2034
01:57:58,050 --> 01:58:01,260
the nogen artists we get such a
kick out of it every single time

2035
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:06,000
and we just love that we're
arguing over real work real

2036
01:58:06,030 --> 01:58:08,400
input from people and remember
you're not doing it for us

2037
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:10,290
you're doing it for no agenda
nation you do it for your

2038
01:58:10,290 --> 01:58:14,190
brothers and sisters. That's
what's going on here. I mean in

2039
01:58:14,190 --> 01:58:16,740
that regard, yes. No agenda
socialists also that's you're

2040
01:58:16,740 --> 01:58:20,730
doing all that for each other.
That's That's all fine. So

2041
01:58:20,730 --> 01:58:24,060
that's your time and talent. The
treasure portion is of course

2042
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:28,500
critical to keeping the show
going. Then the good showing

2043
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:33,180
today in no small part thanks to
our top executive producer I

2044
01:58:33,180 --> 01:58:37,350
didn't even see this I mean, I'm
really look at the I have no

2045
01:58:37,350 --> 01:58:40,350
time in the morning to read the
whole the whole spreadsheet but

2046
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:45,240
this is from some earthling in
Houston in Woodlands Texas

2047
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:50,370
$3,000 Now I'm blown away I'm
blown away by this Adam leaves

2048
01:58:50,370 --> 01:58:53,400
the note Adam and John thank you
for not only wading through the

2049
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:57,420
much each week to the I think it
means the muck each week to

2050
01:58:57,420 --> 01:59:01,140
provide us with much NO I may be
much might be too much to

2051
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:04,800
provide us with the treasure you
find but for truly doing it with

2052
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:08,580
your independent approach the NA
ecosystem and culture rocks and

2053
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:12,420
we cannot thank you enough for
creating it. Thank you again for

2054
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:15,720
truly helping us scour so many
sources searching for the truth

2055
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:19,740
Yes you do. You do. Clips, boots
on the ground all kinds of great

2056
01:59:19,740 --> 01:59:22,770
your own personal experiences
all part of the system. That's

2057
01:59:22,770 --> 01:59:26,880
why you're all producers, not
listeners or fans. Most of all,

2058
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:29,550
thank you for being such an
inspirational example of

2059
01:59:29,550 --> 01:59:33,360
independence, the V four v and
other things y'all do, to remain

2060
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:37,320
free of influence etc is
incredible. Honestly, I want to

2061
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:40,620
write a novel to you both just
exploring these two principles

2062
01:59:40,620 --> 01:59:44,160
but I will refrain for now thank
you. Simply put, what you do and

2063
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:47,550
have done is appreciated more
than you can know your prayers

2064
01:59:47,550 --> 01:59:50,700
karma in Sudha insert how you
view it will be appreciated as

2065
01:59:50,700 --> 01:59:53,730
well. You got it. I'll give that
to you. I would love to pick

2066
01:59:53,730 --> 01:59:56,190
your brains with either if you'd
be open to a short interview I

2067
01:59:56,190 --> 01:59:59,760
may be in I may even be in order
to come to Fredericksburg. If

2068
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:03,840
that's In the cards, I'll meet
you, brother, or sister, or

2069
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:07,440
sling, some Earthlink, or sling
or sling. You can't use the

2070
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:10,650
actual alien, you come to
Fredericksburg. Of course, Dad,

2071
02:00:10,650 --> 02:00:12,570
I'll take you out to lunch.

2072
02:00:13,350 --> 02:00:14,700
John C Dvorak: He's the
woodlands. So it's

2073
02:00:14,940 --> 02:00:19,500
Adam Curry: not. It's not just a
drive. It's a couple of drive to

2074
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:23,580
a couple of thank you so much.
And, and congratulations on now.

2075
02:00:23,580 --> 02:00:25,140
Are these PhDs numbered?

2076
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:28,470
John C Dvorak: No, but they're
listed they're going to be

2077
02:00:28,470 --> 02:00:29,820
listed in a an archive.

2078
02:00:29,879 --> 02:00:32,099
Adam Curry: Okay, they will be
an online Well, you were the

2079
02:00:32,099 --> 02:00:33,269
first one to receive

2080
02:00:33,299 --> 02:00:35,879
John C Dvorak: like, an official
like, well, you actually think

2081
02:00:35,879 --> 02:00:40,079
about it, you know, that would
be the number and number them

2082
02:00:40,619 --> 02:00:45,629
one slash 100 It would be more
of an artwork you're getting but

2083
02:00:46,829 --> 02:00:48,419
no, we're not doing that.

2084
02:00:48,660 --> 02:00:50,850
Adam Curry: You could have just
said no, but thanks for the long

2085
02:00:50,850 --> 02:00:51,150
day.

2086
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:54,150
John C Dvorak: Thinking about
it. The problem is you got to be

2087
02:00:54,150 --> 02:00:54,840
thinking about it.

2088
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:58,170
Adam Curry: Some earthling Thank
you very much. Here's the karma

2089
02:00:58,170 --> 02:01:01,020
your requests I shall pray for
you. You've got karma.

2090
02:01:04,020 --> 02:01:07,200
John C Dvorak: He well. Was good
news from the no agenda shop in

2091
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:12,630
Fayetteville, Georgia. They have
our cut of the action $14.18

2092
02:01:12,630 --> 02:01:17,760
Since ITM guys the shop is still
alive as the shop you should go

2093
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:22,320
visit because they got cool
stuff to do. And here although I

2094
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:26,460
think is I think the website it
could be easier to find some of

2095
02:01:26,460 --> 02:01:30,090
the cool stuff. Here's your cut
artists have been paid as well.

2096
02:01:30,180 --> 02:01:32,580
If anyone is looking for
recommendations check out my

2097
02:01:32,580 --> 02:01:39,180
tequila review podcast at still
chillin.com and wherever find

2098
02:01:39,180 --> 02:01:42,240
podcasts are heard, take you for
encouragement all you do.

2099
02:01:42,690 --> 02:01:45,300
Adam Curry: And again this is a
perfect example of time talent

2100
02:01:45,330 --> 02:01:50,040
and treasure no agenda shop they
can do whatever they want to do

2101
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:53,520
we have no agreements no
contracts, run with it. And we

2102
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:56,070
have we have one restriction
don't put our heads on anything.

2103
02:01:56,280 --> 02:01:59,310
They work out a deal with the
artists who are all nodes in our

2104
02:01:59,310 --> 02:02:01,770
generator and then whenever
there's something leftover

2105
02:02:01,770 --> 02:02:05,250
whenever they feel this right
that send a donation. And there

2106
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:08,910
you go. And we've we've we've
never even met them in person.

2107
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:12,480
John C Dvorak: And what's cool
is that we don't do shirts they

2108
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:16,500
do. We don't do hats they do and
people that do shirts and hats

2109
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:19,020
and all the rest that's a
business separate from

2110
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:25,620
podcasting to an extreme. We'd
be losing $814.18 Euro

2111
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:30,840
Adam Curry: Yes, we would
exactly what happened and we'd

2112
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:36,450
have to have meetings. Oh god no
great lusty is in Tomahawk

2113
02:02:36,450 --> 02:02:42,690

tow. Wow, that's some

2117
02:02:54,990 --> 02:02:58,680
dedication. And yeah, and it
will pay off. You will love it.

2118
02:02:58,710 --> 02:03:02,640
Great, lusty? Send us a report.
Send this report.

2119

John C Dvorak: Anonymous in
Biloxi, Mississippi. Four.

2120
02:03:08,790 --> 02:03:11,790
Three. Biloxi is a really nice
place. By the way. I've been

2121
02:03:11,790 --> 02:03:15,390
guys first time donating well
forgiving me pod father, but I

2122
02:03:15,660 --> 02:03:18,270
just wanted to express my
appreciation for the show,

2123
02:03:18,270 --> 02:03:21,930
especially during COVID. I was
an avid Joe Rogan listener when

2124
02:03:21,930 --> 02:03:25,140
COVID first started, and I
listened to the episode with

2125
02:03:25,140 --> 02:03:29,760
that lunatic Michael Osterholm
and him saying a million people

2126
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:30,660
are gonna die

2127
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:32,880
Adam Curry: 1,000,003 million.

2128
02:03:32,910 --> 02:03:35,730
John C Dvorak: Yeah, he says a
million in the note. Yeah, he

2129
02:03:35,730 --> 02:03:42,180
said 3 million. And it's going
to get really bad. Really bad it

2130
02:03:42,180 --> 02:03:45,390
actually had. Oh, it actually
had me freaking out a little

2131
02:03:45,390 --> 02:03:48,990
bit. And I consider myself a
very rational person. But I went

2132
02:03:48,990 --> 02:03:52,710
back and listened to Adams
episode. And luckily he plugged

2133
02:03:52,710 --> 02:03:59,100
the show that plugging the show
helps works, even though when

2134
02:03:59,100 --> 02:04:02,670
Adam was talking about people
getting rings and nice things so

2135
02:04:02,670 --> 02:04:07,560
it was a little weird at the
time, but I'll check it out. And

2136
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:12,270
ever since I haven't missed an
episode. Yeah, I can see how by

2137
02:04:12,270 --> 02:04:16,110
not listening to the show and
only watching the M five M I

2138
02:04:16,110 --> 02:04:19,680
could have easily been one of
those people double masked up

2139
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:24,210
driving around in my car by
myself and with my fifth jab by

2140
02:04:24,210 --> 02:04:28,350
now. But I just wanted to
express my sincere appreciation

2141
02:04:28,350 --> 02:04:31,800
for both you during that time
and today for keeping us sane

2142
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:33,720
for two to three $3.33 I'm

2143
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:35,550
Adam Curry: gonna give him a

2144
02:04:35,550 --> 02:04:37,140
it. But it's the first donation
so

people do that. I have no idea

2193
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:11,610
why they're doing that. Well,

2194
02:08:11,610 --> 02:08:14,820
Adam Curry: he's you know, it's
his first time so now I guess.

Oh, we go. Jason rich just

at White Oak pastures. That was

2199
02:08:27,660 --> 02:08:30,540

2204
02:08:45,090 --> 02:08:48,420
My wife and I just purchased the
neighboring ranch and are fixing

2205
02:08:48,420 --> 02:08:52,200

02:09:11,610 --> 02:09:14,190
John C Dvorak: Give me the put
some flank stakes aside, though

2214
02:09:26,730 --> 02:09:28,050
Adam Curry: Yep, makes no no.

2215
02:09:28,769 --> 02:09:31,199
John C Dvorak: Oh Jensen
pintail, Wyoming happy 16 years

2216
02:09:31,199 --> 02:09:33,539
loving to show thank you for
highlighting the absurdity of

2217
02:09:33,539 --> 02:09:37,319
the world that we now live in.
So many discussions are so sad

2218
02:09:37,319 --> 02:09:39,869
but your voice has helped to
lighten the burden of the

2219
02:09:39,869 --> 02:09:43,949
insanity. I happen to have some
knowledge of rapid test kits and

2220
02:09:43,949 --> 02:09:49,679
it is beyond shocking. Beyond
Shocking. Shocking, that it is

2221
02:09:49,679 --> 02:09:54,119
now okay to willy nilly extended
an expiration date without going

2222
02:09:54,119 --> 02:09:59,819
back to the FDA to prove that it
gets still works absurd. Since I

2223
02:09:59,819 --> 02:10:03,299
do not believe that Cove to even
exist These kits are most

2224
02:10:03,299 --> 02:10:09,479
certainly crap. Even before
expert exploration. I would dare

2225
02:10:09,479 --> 02:10:13,739
say they are designed to be
designed to be an accurate Yes,

2226
02:10:13,769 --> 02:10:16,559
I suppose as long as the
internal control is working, the

2227
02:10:16,559 --> 02:10:19,979
test must be right. Right. The
promotion is that these kits

2228
02:10:19,979 --> 02:10:24,269
work best on the fourth day is
genius. Because of the dingbats

2229
02:10:24,269 --> 02:10:28,019
that I know, most of which are
no better good. We'll test all

2230
02:10:28,019 --> 02:10:31,439
four days because the primary
symptoms for COVID is now I

2231
02:10:31,439 --> 02:10:32,639
don't feel right.

2232
02:10:34,650 --> 02:10:36,120
Adam Curry: My nose is running.

2233
02:10:39,870 --> 02:10:42,090
John C Dvorak: The kiss must be
flying off the shelves. Final

2234
02:10:42,090 --> 02:10:46,470
note that recently a colleague
announced that she was COVID

2235
02:10:46,470 --> 02:10:49,770
positive at just after her
recent flu shot. Isn't that

2236
02:10:49,770 --> 02:10:53,100
interesting? She didn't have any
symptoms other than fatigue, you

2237
02:10:53,100 --> 02:10:57,570
know? She just didn't feel
right. She is waiting for PCR

2238
02:10:57,570 --> 02:11:00,360
confirmation can't do good work.
Good. Thank you for your courage

2239
02:11:00,360 --> 02:11:04,800
Dame Cheryl cowgirl of the Wind
River Range wa oming does she

Scream? Oh, she also

2241
02:11:07,860 --> 02:11:12,300

02:11:12,300 --> 02:11:13,230
like you got COVID

2243
02:11:13,650 --> 02:11:15,180

02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:49,140
figured it was time to make an
honest podcast listeners out of

Adam Curry: That is very cool.
It's a great birthday cake. You

2257
02:12:05,610 --> 02:12:07,290
should also probably just give
them a flame thrower or

2258
02:12:07,290 --> 02:12:10,020
something like that. It's also
cool 50 year old guys like that.

Jonathan is a hard working man,

hit me in the mouth a few years

2261
02:12:17,730 --> 02:12:20,400
ago, and I have to be honest, at
first, I thought it was getting

2262
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:29,580
corrupted by the show. Wow, was
the marriage on the rocks. But

2263
02:12:29,580 --> 02:12:32,880
when I actually started
listening, my eyes were opened

2264
02:12:32,910 --> 02:12:37,050
and my amygdala expanded. I'll
always be grateful. Thanks for

2265

all you do. Please play China's

that. I just thought it's true.

That's true. Whereas it's
worthy. It's true ladies. And we

2268
02:12:49,650 --> 02:12:52,290
had no been asked for that one
in a while.

2269
02:12:53,580 --> 02:12:55,350

out of favor.

Donald Trump it's true. What is

of people who said that they

2272
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:03,450
couldn't listen to the show
because they felt it was

2273
02:13:03,450 --> 02:13:04,350
corrupting them.

2274
02:13:05,130 --> 02:13:10,890
Adam Curry: Really? Really now?
Yeah. corrupting them in what

2275
02:13:10,890 --> 02:13:12,840
way? I don't know.

2276
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:21,750
I can't find this anymore. What

02:14:14,460 --> 02:14:17,820

2294
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:32,550

you if you want to violate his

2297

desires to be anonymous. And he
says sometimes I know use it

2298
02:14:41,550 --> 02:14:42,690

Adam Curry: now I'm conflicted.
Some Well you tell me tell me if

Adam, Adam and John. Actually, I

2350
02:18:14,790 --> 02:18:18,480
wore my no agenda University t
shirt out on the town Friday

2351
02:18:18,480 --> 02:18:22,560
13th And ended up at Ellen's
wine room in Sanford, Florida

2352
02:18:22,560 --> 02:18:26,550
and organically created a
fantastic impromptu meet up. We

2353
02:18:26,550 --> 02:18:28,950
had many people in the wine room
discussing no agenda after

2354
02:18:28,950 --> 02:18:31,950
sirloin and I hit people in the
mouth. The T shirt was an

2355
02:18:31,950 --> 02:18:35,250
amazing conversation piece.
Everyone should go to the no

2356
02:18:35,250 --> 02:18:38,040
agenda shop and buy their own T
shirts and enjoy the great

2357

going to remember this.

2413
02:22:36,660 --> 02:22:40,890
John C Dvorak: I still have I
still have people using the the

2414
02:22:40,890 --> 02:22:46,590
legacy account, which is a
decade or maybe longer, too old.

2415
02:22:46,980 --> 02:22:49,230
And I've talked to pay pal about
this because we now have an

2416
02:22:49,230 --> 02:22:52,080
account executive because you
know, that calls once in a

2417
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:52,260
while.

2418
02:22:53,580 --> 02:22:56,190
Adam Curry: Or they say like,
Hey, what's this weird donation?

2419
02:22:56,190 --> 02:22:57,600
Are you guys terrorists?

2420
02:22:58,290 --> 02:23:00,570
John C Dvorak: Now they never do
they have done that. Oh, and so

2421
02:23:00,570 --> 02:23:02,790
the guy calls and I said, you
know, and he says, Well, I don't

2422
02:23:02,790 --> 02:23:05,220
know what we need, because he
would they have programs, you

2423
02:23:05,220 --> 02:23:09,060
know what get you on this great
deal. It works. Yeah. So I said,

2424
02:23:09,060 --> 02:23:11,550
Well, you know, we don't need
that. Okay, well, I explained

2425
02:23:11,550 --> 02:23:13,530
the business model and
everything to the guy and I

2426
02:23:13,530 --> 02:23:16,740
said, but the one thing you guys
could help with? And he

2427
02:23:16,740 --> 02:23:19,500
certainly, you know, it's not
really my job to do this. But he

2428
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:22,800
says I'll give it a shot and see
if I can get it done. Which is

2429
02:23:22,800 --> 02:23:28,200
to move the the legacy account
all the people over to the

2430
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:30,570
regular account and then get rid
of that thing.

2431
02:23:30,720 --> 02:23:34,800
Adam Curry: No, they can't do
that. They're gonna try, they

2432
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:41,160
can see, you know, a friend of
mine lost the email that he had

2433
02:23:41,160 --> 02:23:45,450
his ex account registered to
when it was still Twitter. That

2434
02:23:45,450 --> 02:23:51,300
email address went away and they
cannot reset your password. If

2435
02:23:51,300 --> 02:23:54,450
you don't if you don't believe
what they can't do. It's just

2436
02:23:54,450 --> 02:23:58,770
not possible. He was lucky
enough to buy the domain back

2437
02:23:58,770 --> 02:24:02,940
and set up an email address to
get it back. But it's it's

2438
02:24:02,940 --> 02:24:06,480
impossible. It's crazy. It's
unbelievable what they can't do

2439
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:10,320
what they can't do. Thank you

2456
02:25:12,150 --> 02:25:16,950

biggest kick out image. First

2457
02:25:16,950 --> 02:25:20,970

That's hilarious. They look at

it and they go and they look and
they have a big funnel look for

2459
02:25:24,570 --> 02:25:26,970
what and then they figure out
it's a big joke. So

02:38:25,830 --> 02:38:28,080
drug you think it's a drug?
Maybe? Or?

2653
02:38:28,500 --> 02:38:31,740
John C Dvorak: I don't know they
can do something that will be

2654
02:38:31,770 --> 02:38:35,460
Adam Curry: a new survey. How
about a government run social

2655
02:38:35,460 --> 02:38:37,260
network? That's better for your
health.

2656
02:38:38,160 --> 02:38:40,260
John C Dvorak: When it happens,
we'll be the first one we'll

2657
02:38:40,260 --> 02:38:41,970
Adam Curry: know. We'll know.
We'll know. Yeah,

2658
02:38:42,480 --> 02:38:47,280
John C Dvorak: I have to. To one
of his kind of funny I don't

2659
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:49,980
know if it's a good enough
showcase but it's funny is ISO

2660
02:38:49,980 --> 02:38:51,930
8010 80%

2661
02:38:51,960 --> 02:38:53,940
Unknown: of structures have been
decimated.

2662
02:38:56,070 --> 02:38:59,910
John C Dvorak: So long, long 80%
of structures have been

2663
02:38:59,910 --> 02:39:03,480
decimated just Yeah.
Interesting. All right. Well, I

2664
02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:07,020
try this one dystopian
nightmare. Guess Tolkien

2665
02:39:07,050 --> 02:39:10,710
Adam Curry: nightmare. I like it
nothing like a good Amy I so let

2666
02:39:10,710 --> 02:39:11,070
me see what

2667
02:39:11,070 --> 02:39:13,860
John C Dvorak: I've got. She's
got vocal fry in it too. I get

2668
02:39:13,860 --> 02:39:16,170
bonus vocal fry. It is bonus

2669
02:39:16,170 --> 02:39:19,410
Adam Curry: Tolkien nightmare.
Yeah, yeah, it's a bonus. It's a

2670
02:39:19,410 --> 02:39:26,100
bonus. Let's see what I got. The
things I do for this show. is

2671
02:39:26,100 --> 02:39:27,420
too long is too long.

2672
02:39:27,720 --> 02:39:28,560
Unknown: It's funny though.

2673
02:39:28,890 --> 02:39:31,110
It feels wrong but it's actually
right.

2674
02:39:33,270 --> 02:39:36,810
Adam Curry: And then my favorite
here's the ringer. I swallowed a

2675
02:39:36,810 --> 02:39:40,110
bug Come on.

2676
02:39:41,580 --> 02:39:46,320
John C Dvorak: You know it's
really good. dystopian

2677
02:39:46,320 --> 02:39:51,420
nightmare, like reflects the
show. Yeah. But I would go with

2678
02:39:51,420 --> 02:39:54,510
that. But if you want to use
it's up to you, you just use

2679
02:39:54,540 --> 02:39:57,870
your choice are you because I
know you love I swallowed a bug.

2680
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:01,290
Adam Curry: I'm gonna I'm gonna
look at the troll room. Alright

2681
02:40:01,290 --> 02:40:05,670
troll room. Here we go first one
I swallowed up. And the second

2682
02:40:07,109 --> 02:40:09,629
Unknown: limit trolls. Tolkien
nightmare.

2683
02:40:10,770 --> 02:40:13,170
John C Dvorak: They're going to
pick the bug because the troll

2684
02:40:13,170 --> 02:40:13,860
room now

2685
02:40:13,860 --> 02:40:20,130
Adam Curry: I get bug bug bug.
Bug bug bug Amy bug. Yes AMI AMI

2686
02:40:20,130 --> 02:40:25,830
AMI bug bug bug. Bug bug bug bug
bug bug bug bug bug? Nightmare

2687
02:40:25,830 --> 02:40:31,230
bug? Wow, no toss it. Let's do
that. I'm gonna do dystopian

2688
02:40:31,230 --> 02:40:35,640
nightmare. I'm with you. It's
it. It's reflects the show that

2689
02:40:35,640 --> 02:40:36,900
can always play the bug.

2690
02:40:37,440 --> 02:40:38,400
John C Dvorak: How about this?

2691
02:40:38,430 --> 02:40:40,140
Adam Curry: No, don't make me
combo it.

2692
02:40:41,370 --> 02:40:44,820
John C Dvorak: I swallowed a bug
followed by Nestopia. Now

2693
02:40:44,820 --> 02:40:47,070
Adam Curry: it has to be three
seconds or less. That is the

2694
02:40:47,070 --> 02:40:50,850
rule. That's the rule. That's
the rule. But because I give you

2695
02:40:50,850 --> 02:40:55,890
that I will get the next clip.
Did you know In the world of

2696
02:40:55,890 --> 02:40:58,710
podcasting that Rob Lowe has a
podcast

2697
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:03,750
John C Dvorak: course why would
I know? I don't know that.

2698
02:41:03,750 --> 02:41:05,670
There's no way I would know
that. I didn't know it

2699
02:41:05,670 --> 02:41:09,570
Adam Curry: either. Rob Lowe has
a podcast. It's pretty

2700
02:41:09,570 --> 02:41:13,110
interesting. He had Arnold
Schwarzenegger on his podcast.

2701
02:41:13,650 --> 02:41:16,380
And this is a clip that's been
doing the rounds because it's

2702
02:41:16,380 --> 02:41:17,520
quite entertaining.

2703
02:41:17,580 --> 02:41:19,230
Unknown: Okay, let me ask you
this. And I asked people this

2704
02:41:19,230 --> 02:41:23,760
all the time. David Dreier, good
friend of ours. Yes. And good

2705
02:41:23,760 --> 02:41:27,330
man. served for many, many, many
years. He used to have the

2706
02:41:27,330 --> 02:41:30,930
greatest what makes me a
Republican and he had I think

2707
02:41:30,930 --> 02:41:34,620
four or five things I think was
in no particular strong

2708
02:41:34,620 --> 02:41:39,390
military, low taxes, less
government, more personal

2709
02:41:39,390 --> 02:41:44,130
freedoms. There might have been
one a COVID but it makes sense

2710
02:41:44,130 --> 02:41:47,430
to know strong law enforcement
strong law on the person and

2711
02:41:47,430 --> 02:41:51,180
then I'd like to know what the I
was asked Democrats what it

2712
02:41:51,180 --> 02:41:54,960
means to be a Democrat in that
way and I think whatever anybody

2713
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:58,590
would say is boy that what this
what would they say

2714
02:41:59,220 --> 02:42:04,260
to this? What's that room you
sit on your city? Sob about

2715
02:42:04,260 --> 02:42:07,050
ruining the cities? You know,
the fuck up every city in

2716
02:42:07,050 --> 02:42:12,000
America? That's what seems to be
the theme right now. Why is

2717
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:13,200
that? I have no idea. I

2718
02:42:17,580 --> 02:42:21,510
Adam Curry: thought that was
dynamite. is funny. You don't

2719
02:42:21,510 --> 02:42:24,360
hear Arnold dropped the F bomb.
Of course. He said screw your

2720
02:42:24,360 --> 02:42:27,660
freedom. We haven't forgotten
that you don't get a pass. You

2721
02:42:27,660 --> 02:42:31,380
don't get a pass because you're
funny here Arnold. But that was

2722
02:42:31,380 --> 02:42:33,480
funny. I thought that was pretty
good.

2723
02:42:33,720 --> 02:42:38,040
John C Dvorak: I want to give
ourselves some kudos for picking

2724
02:42:38,040 --> 02:42:41,100
up on something somebody
accidentally said. And here's

2725
02:42:41,100 --> 02:42:44,610
the kudos clip. Second carrier
group is on its way and

2726
02:42:44,610 --> 02:42:45,000
Secretary

2727
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,730
Unknown: of Defense Lloyd Austin
says the US will send a second

2728
02:42:47,730 --> 02:42:51,150
carrier group will west as
Dwight D. Eisenhower to the

2729
02:42:51,150 --> 02:42:54,900
eastern Mediterranean to help to
tour the widening of the war

2730
02:42:54,900 --> 02:42:58,980
between Israel and Hamas. This
carrier joins the Gerald R Ford

2731
02:42:58,980 --> 02:43:02,370
Carrier Strike Group which
arrived earlier this week.

2732
02:43:02,430 --> 02:43:04,650
Adam Curry: You know, all the
vets are all worried about was

2733
02:43:04,650 --> 02:43:07,650
it the Phoenix that Israel
attacked?

2734
02:43:10,230 --> 02:43:12,660
John C Dvorak: Liberty back in
the day? No, it was at Liberty

2735
02:43:12,660 --> 02:43:16,500
at Liberty, the USS Liberty that
the Israelis killed a bunch of

2736
02:43:16,500 --> 02:43:19,410
American soldiers. They're
covered guys. Yeah.

2737
02:43:19,800 --> 02:43:21,960
Adam Curry: The Libya. Yeah.
They're all worried about it.

2738
02:43:22,260 --> 02:43:25,470
Like this is not good. This is
very dangerous.

2739
02:43:26,670 --> 02:43:28,680
John C Dvorak: Well, they still
don't trust anybody after that

2740
02:43:28,680 --> 02:43:30,900
Liberty experience. And that
thing is still been covered up.

2741
02:43:30,900 --> 02:43:33,750
It's it's been suppressed to
this day.

2742
02:43:33,990 --> 02:43:38,160
Adam Curry: Yeah. Yes. Yes.
Well, it's on the wiki but still

2743
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:43,320
kind of not know. Alright, since
we're doing kudos, bow just give

2744
02:43:43,320 --> 02:43:46,740
kudos to myself for calling this
one a long time ago.

2745
02:43:46,769 --> 02:43:48,959
Unknown: The president is
expected to arrive later this

2746
02:43:48,959 --> 02:43:52,049
afternoon. We know among the
topics we'll be discussing is

2747
02:43:52,049 --> 02:43:54,929
the Mid Atlantic hydrogen hub,
which the White House expects

2748
02:43:55,079 --> 02:43:59,219
we'll bring about 40,000 jobs to
our region. Take a look at this.

2749
02:43:59,219 --> 02:44:01,829
Here's what we are expecting.
You know, the President will be

2750
02:44:01,829 --> 02:44:05,099
here with the energy secretary.
They're announcing seven

2751
02:44:05,099 --> 02:44:09,089
regional clean hydrogen hubs
that were selected to receive $7

2752
02:44:09,089 --> 02:44:12,899
billion in funding to accelerate
the domestic market for low cost

2753
02:44:12,899 --> 02:44:16,109
clean hydrogen. According to the
White House hydrogen, which is a

2754
02:44:16,109 --> 02:44:20,459
clean fuel helps the US reduce
emissions while creating jobs

2755
02:44:20,459 --> 02:44:23,369
and building healthier
communities. Now we know that

2756
02:44:23,519 --> 02:44:26,759
mid atlantic hub will be in
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and

2757
02:44:26,759 --> 02:44:30,239
Delaware again, creating 1000s
of jobs. We will have the latest

2758
02:44:30,449 --> 02:44:32,129
on that announcement when it
happens.

2759
02:44:32,970 --> 02:44:38,790
Adam Curry: Clean Energy clean
hydrogen. This scam is here now.

2760
02:44:38,970 --> 02:44:43,770
Clean hydrogen $7 billion

2761
02:44:44,250 --> 02:44:45,840
John C Dvorak: for good news
story. I didn't know this was

2762
02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:48,210
happening. You know they're
throwing money at this 7

2763
02:44:48,210 --> 02:44:52,080
Adam Curry: billion. Yeah,
that's a lot. $7 billion for

2764
02:44:52,080 --> 02:44:56,730
clean hydrogen. Crazy. All
right. I promised the story

2765
02:44:56,730 --> 02:44:57,690
about Wisconsin.

2766
02:44:57,870 --> 02:45:02,460
Unknown: Now is time for our
friends now. was initiated.

2767
02:45:02,669 --> 02:45:05,789
Adam Curry: Yes, trans Maoism
continues just because there's

2768
02:45:05,999 --> 02:45:09,869
that we do have a war and it's
covering up a lot and but we

2769
02:45:09,869 --> 02:45:14,729
still will stay on the stories
that matter. This is a video

2770
02:45:14,759 --> 02:45:17,879
that is from Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation kids

2771
02:45:17,879 --> 02:45:23,189
news, CBC kids news. Kids do
kid's news and it is being used

2772
02:45:23,189 --> 02:45:27,629
in Wisconsin schools for fourth
graders. It is animated kind of

2773
02:45:27,629 --> 02:45:31,919
like, no agenda animated, no
agenda, that style a little,

2774
02:45:32,489 --> 02:45:37,439
little more purposeful. Both
kids are brown. The mom looks

2775
02:45:37,469 --> 02:45:44,099
Asian, the dad looks Mexican or
Latin X. The baby in the story

2776
02:45:44,099 --> 02:45:49,709
is white. So it's a very, it's a
very polarizing visuals. And we

2777
02:45:49,709 --> 02:45:52,169
can stop it anytime you want.
But I think it's worth listening

2778
02:45:52,169 --> 02:45:56,159
to the entire thing again, this
is for children's CBC kids news.

2779
02:45:56,159 --> 02:45:58,769
You can find it right there on
YouTube. They broadcast it on

2780
02:45:58,769 --> 02:46:02,009
television, and now in Wisconsin
schools for fourth graders.

2781
02:46:05,940 --> 02:46:07,080
Unknown: Oh,

2782
02:46:07,560 --> 02:46:12,810
Hi, baby. Are you a boy or girl?
Funny you should ask Syd. One of

2783
02:46:12,810 --> 02:46:16,200
the first things they check when
a new baby is born is what kind

2784
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:20,100
of body parts they have. They do
that to determine a baby sex.

2785
02:46:20,340 --> 02:46:24,150
Most of the time, it's easy to
determine. And sometimes it's

2786
02:46:24,150 --> 02:46:29,610
more complicated. This one has a
penis. Boy, this one has a

2787
02:46:29,610 --> 02:46:31,710
vulva. It's girls.

2788
02:46:31,740 --> 02:46:34,260
Adam Curry: I gotta stop it
right there. Why do they use

2789
02:46:34,260 --> 02:46:39,570
vulva instead of vagina? What is
the reasoning behind that?

2790
02:46:39,600 --> 02:46:41,760
John C Dvorak: Well that now
that you stopped it because I

2791
02:46:41,760 --> 02:46:45,840
would have said well I'm gonna
dumb thing to say. I have to.

2792
02:46:46,440 --> 02:46:49,170
I'm glad you stopped it because
now we have to discuss this.

2793
02:46:49,200 --> 02:46:52,470
Yes. Here's the reason there's
these things are not done

2794
02:46:52,470 --> 02:46:52,890
without

2795
02:46:53,100 --> 02:47:03,750
Adam Curry: cola troll room. Not
Volvo, Volvo Volvo I love being

2796
02:47:03,750 --> 02:47:07,950
childish. 15 forever, right? But
why? Why? Why? Why?

2797
02:47:09,630 --> 02:47:13,440
John C Dvorak: The vulva is the
global term that describes all

2798
02:47:13,440 --> 02:47:17,790
of the structures that make the
female external genitalia. The

2799
02:47:17,790 --> 02:47:23,580
components of the vulva, or the
mons pubis, labia majora, labia,

2800
02:47:23,580 --> 02:47:28,080
minerale, clitoris, okay, this
bigger vulva, Deborah, blah,

2801
02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:30,270
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, whole bunch of

2802
02:47:30,270 --> 02:47:35,460
stuff and the and the vaginal
opening. So this is a new one

2803
02:47:35,460 --> 02:47:36,960
that they're trying to push.

2804
02:47:36,990 --> 02:47:39,420
Adam Curry: It's only the
external stuff. It's only the

2805
02:47:39,420 --> 02:47:41,100
stuff you can see on the outside
what it

2806
02:47:41,100 --> 02:47:43,140
John C Dvorak: says.
Interesting. Yeah, just the

2807
02:47:43,140 --> 02:47:43,800
external.

2808
02:47:44,010 --> 02:47:49,230
Unknown: It's more complicated.
This one has a penis. Boy, this

2809
02:47:49,230 --> 02:47:55,560
one has a MOBA girl.
Congratulations. Oh, let's hit

2810
02:47:55,560 --> 02:47:59,370
the brakes. People. The way your
body looks on the outside is

2811
02:47:59,400 --> 02:48:05,280
only part of the story. One,
stay with me gang. This is

2812
02:48:05,280 --> 02:48:10,140
important. I live. Your six
refers to your physical body

2813
02:48:10,140 --> 02:48:13,380
parts, remember, but there is
also something called Gender,

2814
02:48:13,500 --> 02:48:16,860
which is how you feel inside
your body and who you know

2815
02:48:16,860 --> 02:48:20,880
yourself to be and your gender.
How you feel on the inside.

2816
02:48:21,120 --> 02:48:24,360
doesn't always match the sex you
recalled when you were born.

2817
02:48:25,080 --> 02:48:28,440
Okay, let's say you were born
with a penis and you feel like a

2818
02:48:28,440 --> 02:48:32,310
boy inside. In that case, your
sex and your gender match? Well,

2819
02:48:32,310 --> 02:48:35,550
what if you were born with a
penis? And you know your girl

2820
02:48:35,550 --> 02:48:38,850
inside? It's not a boy, then
your sex and your gender don't

2821
02:48:38,850 --> 02:48:42,690
match? Wait, what's those know
your girl inside mean anyway?

2822
02:48:42,750 --> 02:48:45,630
Does that mean you have to love
pink things and princesses?

2823
02:48:45,930 --> 02:48:49,470
Nope. Sometimes people refer to
things as girl things and boy

2824
02:48:49,470 --> 02:48:52,500
things but this is just how
people sometimes classify

2825
02:48:52,500 --> 02:48:55,950
things, usually to make it
easier to sell stuff to kids and

2826
02:48:55,950 --> 02:48:56,550
their parents.

2827
02:48:56,550 --> 02:49:02,700
Adam Curry: So so the reason why
we call boys boys and girls

2828
02:49:02,700 --> 02:49:09,630
Girls is for people to ease make
it easier to sell stuff. That's

2829
02:49:09,660 --> 02:49:10,860
an interesting take.

2830
02:49:12,930 --> 02:49:15,060
John C Dvorak: It's just how
does that work in a communist

2831
02:49:15,060 --> 02:49:18,840
country? Or, or tribal
organization where this was

2832
02:49:18,840 --> 02:49:21,660
capitalism doesn't apply if
there's no capital. So are they

2833
02:49:21,660 --> 02:49:27,270
saying that? I'm just guessing
here? Are they saying that? It

2834
02:49:27,270 --> 02:49:30,210
this is the problem? Capitalism
is causing this issue? Because

2835
02:49:30,210 --> 02:49:32,460
if there was no capitalism, you
wouldn't have this? Yeah. Then

2836
02:49:32,490 --> 02:49:35,130
then we wouldn't have confusion
if there's no capitalism.

2837
02:49:35,850 --> 02:49:38,490
Correct. I don't see where
that's going.

2838
02:49:39,030 --> 02:49:42,840
Unknown: Close toys and games
are for everyone. You don't have

2839
02:49:42,840 --> 02:49:47,070
to be a boy or a girl to like a
certain thing. Said, has anyone

2840
02:49:47,070 --> 02:49:49,680
ever told you that you shouldn't
say with something or wear

2841
02:49:49,680 --> 02:49:54,600
something because you're a boy
will? Yes. The body parts you

2842
02:49:54,600 --> 02:49:58,110
were born with don't always
dictate who you are, how you

2843
02:49:58,110 --> 02:50:03,000
feel or what you like to play
with. That's such a relief

2844
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:09,510
gender, how you feel? tells you
who you are. And there are a

2845
02:50:09,510 --> 02:50:13,230
whole bunch of possibilities.
Figuring out what feels right

2846
02:50:13,230 --> 02:50:20,340
for you is just part of growing
up. Fine little cutie. You might

2847
02:50:20,340 --> 02:50:22,620
want to change that diaper
sooner than later.

2848
02:50:25,050 --> 02:50:29,490
Adam Curry: Yeah, there you go.
Hello, Canada. Good work. Good

2849
02:50:29,490 --> 02:50:33,630
work up there. And of course
that that results and leads to

2850
02:50:34,560 --> 02:50:36,900
new stories like this to Italy

2851
02:50:36,900 --> 02:50:40,320
Unknown: now where a whole bunch
of transgender men are entering

2852
02:50:40,320 --> 02:50:44,100
the miss Italy pageant after a
pageant rep said transgender

2853
02:50:44,100 --> 02:50:47,580
women can't compete. Alright,
let me lay this out for you.

2854
02:50:47,580 --> 02:50:50,850
Here. It's a little complicated.
The organizer of the miss Italy

2855
02:50:50,850 --> 02:50:54,450
pageant said the pageant only
allows people who were assigned

2856
02:50:54,480 --> 02:50:58,320
a female gender at birth to be
in the competition, meaning

2857
02:50:58,530 --> 02:51:02,160
transgender women, men who
became women would be excluded.

2858
02:51:02,520 --> 02:51:06,390
One transgender man named
Frederico saw this and thought,

2859
02:51:06,390 --> 02:51:11,070
Well, hey, I was born female. So
he decided to enter the pageant

2860
02:51:11,100 --> 02:51:14,160
under his birth name Frederica,
even though he identifies as a

2861
02:51:14,160 --> 02:51:17,700
man now, that moment, then
turned into a movement. One

2862
02:51:17,730 --> 02:51:21,990
LGBTQ group shared his entry on
Facebook, encouraging other

2863
02:51:21,990 --> 02:51:26,340
transgender men to apply. And
now more than 100 trans men have

2864
02:51:26,340 --> 02:51:29,760
entered the pageant, with some
even being called to the next

2865
02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:30,930
stage of the competition.

2866
02:51:32,820 --> 02:51:39,000
Adam Curry: Jesus come quickly,
this world what I find

2867
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:43,380
fascinating is that no point
does anyone state the obvious

2868
02:51:43,380 --> 02:51:50,730
that the whole idea of beauty
contests is is crazy. No, no,

2869
02:51:50,790 --> 02:51:52,320
they don't see they don't see
that.

2870
02:51:52,350 --> 02:51:54,630
John C Dvorak: Well, that used
to be the thing. Yeah, they use

2871
02:51:54,630 --> 02:51:57,000
all your beauty competitions.
And I mean, I'm sure you

2872
02:51:57,000 --> 02:52:02,130
remember, like 25 years ago? I
sure do. Let's say everyone's

2873
02:52:02,130 --> 02:52:04,530
bitching and moaning about
beauty contest. And we used to

2874
02:52:04,530 --> 02:52:07,530
do a review of all of them on
this show me you know, recently.

2875
02:52:07,560 --> 02:52:11,340
Oh, yes. Yeah. Real. Yeah, we
stopped doing it. Yeah. And the

2876
02:52:11,340 --> 02:52:16,230
main complaints, objectified
women and a lot of out of out of

2877
02:52:16,230 --> 02:52:21,390
a bag. And then that died down
for some unknown reason. Now we

2878
02:52:21,390 --> 02:52:22,560
got this. Yeah.

2879
02:52:23,850 --> 02:52:28,410
Adam Curry: It's, the whole
thing is sad. Alright, I have a

2880
02:52:28,470 --> 02:52:30,660
John C Dvorak: two parter. It
says you're on the transgender

2881
02:52:30,660 --> 02:52:34,200
thing that's played by visiting
me dragging along this tick tock

2882
02:52:34,200 --> 02:52:42,750
clip is called tock tock tick,
tock. transphobia, you have to

2883
02:52:42,750 --> 02:52:44,880
look it up from the last couple
of shows. Oh, hold

2884
02:52:44,880 --> 02:52:49,320
Adam Curry: on. Talk, yes, I got
it.

2885
02:52:49,500 --> 02:52:51,360
Unknown: If you are told that
something you're doing is

2886
02:52:51,360 --> 02:52:55,110
transphobic. It is not your job
to try to prove that it's not,

2887
02:52:55,230 --> 02:52:59,130
you are going to mess up. It is
guaranteed. If you are told

2888
02:52:59,130 --> 02:53:01,800
information and you immediately
reject and go, nope, that

2889
02:53:01,800 --> 02:53:05,010
doesn't fit my view of what
transmits means you're not going

2890
02:53:05,010 --> 02:53:07,560
to be able to show up as an
ally, because all you're worried

2891
02:53:07,560 --> 02:53:11,100
about is what you think and you
feel abundant experience that's

2892
02:53:11,100 --> 02:53:13,620
not yours, it's going to be
uncomfortable, it's going to be

2893
02:53:13,620 --> 02:53:16,020
confusing. And it's going to
mean that you are going to have

2894
02:53:16,020 --> 02:53:20,400
to evaluate how gender is seeped
into society, how it has

2895
02:53:20,400 --> 02:53:23,520
affected and shaped your life,
how sis heteronormativity has

2896
02:53:23,520 --> 02:53:26,190
affected your life. And just
because we're existing in front

2897
02:53:26,190 --> 02:53:28,590
of you does not mean that you
get to ask or say whatever you

2898
02:53:28,590 --> 02:53:31,800
want. And that's supposed to be
taken as a compliment. Questions

2899
02:53:31,800 --> 02:53:35,820
can be transphobic, compliments
can be transphobic. And so

2900
02:53:35,910 --> 02:53:39,330
that's where it comes in, where
a lot of the work with being an

2901
02:53:39,330 --> 02:53:43,200
ally, actually has to do with
our own individual reflections

2902
02:53:43,200 --> 02:53:47,850
on how transphobic society has
shaped the way that we think and

2903
02:53:47,850 --> 02:53:50,760
live and treat people. We don't
need allies who are trying to

2904
02:53:50,760 --> 02:53:53,520
prove how good they are or who
were asking for a pat on the

2905
02:53:53,520 --> 02:53:56,910
back or who are trying to seem
nice, or who are worried about

2906
02:53:56,910 --> 02:54:00,840
what they look like. We need
allies who are willing to stand

2907
02:54:00,840 --> 02:54:03,690
up for trans people and learn
how to do that the

2908
02:54:03,690 --> 02:54:04,800
best that they can.

2909
02:54:05,100 --> 02:54:06,480
John C Dvorak: Yeah, by shutting
up.

2910
02:54:07,260 --> 02:54:11,010
Adam Curry: You know, I gotta
mention this. Do you remember

2911
02:54:11,010 --> 02:54:15,180
the podcast conference that I
went to Podcast Movement? And I

2912
02:54:15,180 --> 02:54:17,850
do and they wanted? They wanted
me on a panel. I said Who else?

2913
02:54:17,850 --> 02:54:22,680
Oh, it's this one, this one. And
but you know, we can't have just

2914
02:54:22,680 --> 02:54:25,500
all white guys on the panel. So
we invited this woman who knows

2915
02:54:25,500 --> 02:54:29,010
nothing about the topic because
she's bipoc and that woman

2916
02:54:29,010 --> 02:54:32,160
because she's American
descendants, but they didn't

2917
02:54:32,160 --> 02:54:36,450
know anything about the topic.
And if they're not appropriate

2918
02:54:36,450 --> 02:54:38,730
for this topic here, we can't
have four white guys on the

2919
02:54:38,730 --> 02:54:40,740
panel. I said, Well, you know
what, you can have three because

2920
02:54:40,770 --> 02:54:45,390
I'm out. I'm not a part of this.
So those very same guys, one of

2921
02:54:45,390 --> 02:54:55,500
them had, like a a, like a mini
podcast conference, sold tickets

2922
02:54:55,500 --> 02:55:02,790
to it. It was in in Europe and
Um, they got canceled. I mean,

2923
02:55:02,790 --> 02:55:07,320
they the events still went on
but some black lesbians, who, as

2924
02:55:07,320 --> 02:55:10,350
it was described to me started
calling up speakers they had

2925
02:55:10,350 --> 02:55:13,980
contracted and saying, there's
no there's not enough black

2926
02:55:13,980 --> 02:55:18,870
people on this stage, not enough
LGBTQ, you shouldn't go there.

2927
02:55:18,870 --> 02:55:21,720
And these were people who work
for companies guess what, about

2928
02:55:21,720 --> 02:55:26,670
10% had to cancel. So the very
people who are trying to protect

2929
02:55:27,810 --> 02:55:34,350
the, you know, the, the
sensitivities of LGBTQ bipod

2930
02:55:34,350 --> 02:55:37,320
people were now being cancelled
by those very same people.

2931
02:55:37,530 --> 02:55:41,460
They're great. What this what
they never understand. It's like

2932
02:55:41,460 --> 02:55:45,480
it's going to be used against
you. So you might as well take a

2933
02:55:45,480 --> 02:55:49,380
stand now, because it's going to
come back to bite you in the ass

2934
02:55:49,380 --> 02:55:54,360
eventually. My final two Mom, I
have a funny one. But on my

2935
02:55:54,360 --> 02:56:00,060
final two clips are COVID.
Related, specifically,

2936
02:56:00,120 --> 02:56:07,380
vaccination, adverse events. Dr.
Drew, who I we've played Dr.

2937
02:56:07,380 --> 02:56:11,550
Drew throughout the COVID
period, the COVID years. I think

2938
02:56:11,550 --> 02:56:14,310
we both trust him. He's not
always been in line with our

2939
02:56:14,310 --> 02:56:17,430
thinking we still have always
played his his opinions because

2940
02:56:17,430 --> 02:56:20,940
he is a doctor. Well, boy, he
had there's a new study out that

2941
02:56:20,940 --> 02:56:22,710
he read and he's kind of upset
about it

2942
02:56:22,710 --> 02:56:24,210
Unknown: because the article
came out this week in

2943
02:56:24,210 --> 02:56:28,680
circulation, which is a very
fine high end. A cardiology

2944
02:56:28,680 --> 02:56:30,930
journal is called circulation.
I've been throwing I've been

2945
02:56:30,930 --> 02:56:34,230
sending it around to people. And
it showed it took my breath

2946
02:56:34,230 --> 02:56:38,340
away. I was I was shocked at how
how what an indictment it was.

2947
02:56:38,580 --> 02:56:41,670
It showed that myocarditis was
not that common and not that

2948
02:56:41,670 --> 02:56:45,660
uncommon in young males.
Certainly more common than

2949
02:56:45,660 --> 02:56:50,250
severe COVID in that group,
okay? So myocarditis more common

2950
02:56:50,280 --> 02:56:53,640
than severe COVID. So you're
putting people at risk and

2951
02:56:53,640 --> 02:56:58,710
taking away little problems,
okay? All right, the and then

2952
02:56:58,710 --> 02:57:01,290
you've heard all this it just
myocarditis, as you might use it

2953
02:57:01,290 --> 02:57:04,590
for itself limited somebody
myocarditis throughout my career

2954
02:57:04,590 --> 02:57:09,000
as a medical emergency. And now
this article showed for the

2955
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:12,960
first time that about half of
the kids, these are adolescent

2956
02:57:12,960 --> 02:57:18,510
males who got myocarditis are
going to have lifelong cardiac

2957
02:57:18,510 --> 02:57:22,290
dysfunction, which means a
significant percentage are going

2958
02:57:22,290 --> 02:57:25,620
to end up in heart failure,
hopefully at an advanced age,

2959
02:57:25,620 --> 02:57:28,140
but if not, on the transplant
list.

2960
02:57:28,800 --> 02:57:32,640
Adam Curry: So this comes the
very same week that the Nobel

2961
02:57:32,640 --> 02:57:38,700
Prize for let me see what the
actual title is. Physiology and

2962
02:57:38,700 --> 02:57:45,330
Medicine is given to the
inventors of mRNA. Yeah. And so

2963
02:57:45,330 --> 02:57:49,050
there's a Chinese journalist at
this, this little event, asks a

2964
02:57:49,050 --> 02:57:51,660
question about long term effects
of mRNA. I'm going to tell you

2965
02:57:51,660 --> 02:57:54,030
what she said, because she's a
little difficult to hear, then

2966
02:57:54,030 --> 02:57:58,950
we will hear the answer from the
first scientists receiving this

2967
02:57:58,950 --> 02:58:01,020
Nobel Prize. And then the second
one

2968
02:58:01,860 --> 02:58:06,570
Unknown: was AC sizing media
from China, and waste the mRNA.

2969
02:58:06,750 --> 02:58:10,620
We don't know the long term
effect yet. So do we have any

2970
02:58:10,620 --> 02:58:11,700
concern over that?

2971
02:58:14,520 --> 02:58:17,340
Record? Would you like to
respond to that question?

2972
02:58:21,060 --> 02:58:25,830
Yes, of course, you know, mRNA
vaccines have only been given

2973
02:58:25,830 --> 02:58:28,620
for a certain amount of time,
which begs the question, having

2974
02:58:28,620 --> 02:58:32,190
said that, of course, the mRNA
vaccine that is given is very

2975
02:58:32,190 --> 02:58:36,000
transient, and the fact that 13
billion people have gotten the

2976
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:42,900
virus, vaccine virus. And oops,
I mean, the the amount of side

2977
02:58:42,900 --> 02:58:47,460
effects noted today, it is
extremely limited. So I don't

2978
02:58:47,460 --> 02:58:49,560
think it's a it's a major
concern.

2979
02:58:49,590 --> 02:58:52,530
Adam Curry: So first, this guy
gaffes, it says, Oh, 13 billion

2980
02:58:52,530 --> 02:58:55,230
people have been known. What do
you say he's having with him

2981
02:58:55,230 --> 02:58:58,800
crazy amounts have been given. I
mean, given the virus, I mean,

2982
02:58:58,800 --> 02:59:02,160
virus, I mean, the vaccine,
let's ask the other guy. And

2983
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:07,260
when asked to that, or that's
fine. Oh, yes. I think that's

2984
02:59:07,290 --> 02:59:08,160
yeah, say so.

2985
02:59:08,910 --> 02:59:12,300
Unknown: Well, it can't be
integrated into the nucleus into

2986
02:59:12,300 --> 02:59:17,190
the net. And that's, you know, a
safety precaution. The adverse

2987
02:59:17,610 --> 02:59:24,450
effects, that's been noted is
mostly mild. My court it is

2988
02:59:24,450 --> 02:59:31,110
apparent myocarditis, mainly
affecting young males. But that

2989
02:59:31,440 --> 02:59:35,970
normally resolves without any
short term effects.

2990
02:59:36,060 --> 02:59:40,860
Adam Curry: Oh. So these guys
are getting a Nobel Peace Prize

2991
02:59:40,860 --> 02:59:46,620
while the tonale a Nobel Prize.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2992
02:59:47,520 --> 02:59:50,880
Thank you for correcting me. The
outrage is still there. They're

2993
02:59:50,880 --> 02:59:54,600
getting a Nobel Prize for this
technology and they sit there

2994
02:59:54,600 --> 02:59:59,970
stone cold face and as just
limited. It resolves itself well

2995
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:05,670
The top publication says this is
horrible. And Dr. Drew says this

2996
03:00:05,670 --> 03:00:10,500
is you're going to be in the
transplant list. What is wrong

2997
03:00:10,500 --> 03:00:11,190
with the world?

2998
03:00:13,980 --> 03:00:16,170
John C Dvorak: But there seems
to be a disconnect between

2999
03:00:17,640 --> 03:00:20,880
something and something. And I
think one of those symptoms is

3000
03:00:20,880 --> 03:00:21,480
money.

3001
03:00:22,740 --> 03:00:25,380
Adam Curry: Yeah, yeah.
Unfortunately for the love of

3002
03:00:25,380 --> 03:00:31,740
money is the root of all evil
does seem to hold true. Unless

3003
03:00:31,740 --> 03:00:32,670
you've got something,

3004
03:00:32,760 --> 03:00:34,740
John C Dvorak: let me take one
quick look and see if there's

3005
03:00:34,740 --> 03:00:38,640
anything that's is I got one
kind of an odd ball clip, which

3006
03:00:38,640 --> 03:00:43,740
maybe is worth playing. Gotta
military gotta synced Biden,

3007
03:00:43,740 --> 03:00:49,140
succinct comments on NPR is
always a good way to go out. And

3008
03:00:49,140 --> 03:00:51,870
then I have a weird Mexican
education deal, which is like

3009
03:00:51,870 --> 03:00:52,350
what

3010
03:00:52,380 --> 03:00:55,770
Adam Curry: what? Well, you tell
me which one you want.

3011
03:00:56,130 --> 03:00:59,340
John C Dvorak: I would say this
play the weird Mexican

3012
03:00:59,340 --> 03:01:01,980
educational deal. And you tell
me what's going on here.

3013
03:01:02,039 --> 03:01:05,279
Unknown: under a new law low
income mesco Mexican residents

3014
03:01:05,279 --> 03:01:08,939
living near the California
border can now go to some state

3015
03:01:08,939 --> 03:01:13,379
community colleges at in state
tuition levels. The law creates

3016
03:01:13,379 --> 03:01:15,869
a pilot program for some
Mexicans who want to attend

3017
03:01:15,869 --> 03:01:18,509
certain community colleges in
Southern California and we'll

3018
03:01:18,509 --> 03:01:21,839
run through 2029. The law is
designed to help low income

3019
03:01:21,839 --> 03:01:25,319
Mexicans who live within 45
miles of the California border

3020
03:01:25,319 --> 03:01:29,039
to get an education and prepare
for jobs. Under the new program

3021
03:01:29,039 --> 03:01:34,109
students would pay $46 A unit in
state as opposed to $307 a unit

3022
03:01:34,259 --> 03:01:37,169
out of state. That's according
to a legislative analysis.

3023
03:01:37,349 --> 03:01:40,349
Similar tuition programs are
available at least 24 states

3024
03:01:40,349 --> 03:01:43,139
including Texas, Arizona, and
New Mexico.

3025
03:01:44,940 --> 03:01:47,700
John C Dvorak: Due to literally
Mexicans, New Mexico.

3026
03:01:50,160 --> 03:01:54,270
Adam Curry: I don't know what's
going on. And meanwhile, do you

3027
03:01:54,270 --> 03:01:57,270
know what the most emailed clip
is that I've received this week?

3028
03:01:57,270 --> 03:02:00,060
Can you even it's 12 I don't
want to get 12 seconds of it.

3029
03:02:00,120 --> 03:02:03,450
It's a little longer but can you
just imagine what people are

3030
03:02:03,450 --> 03:02:05,580
asking me as an audio expert?

3031
03:02:07,380 --> 03:02:09,630
John C Dvorak: Oh, they're
asking you this AI are asking if

3032
03:02:09,630 --> 03:02:11,220
it's to be edited. Yep.

3033
03:02:11,790 --> 03:02:15,990
Adam Curry: And it's the same
clip. Do dude, listen to this?

3034
03:02:16,320 --> 03:02:19,080
Did AOC fart on camera

3035
03:02:19,260 --> 03:02:23,490
Unknown: and to ensure that
horrors do not happen in the

3036
03:02:23,490 --> 03:02:29,250
names of victims who do not want
their tragedy used to justify

3037
03:02:29,370 --> 03:02:31,530
further violence and injustice?

3038
03:02:32,100 --> 03:02:36,570
Adam Curry: Wow, she farted on
camera. This is the number one

3039
03:02:36,570 --> 03:02:37,350
email clip

3040
03:02:37,830 --> 03:02:39,300
John C Dvorak: guess what
everyone cares about

3041
03:02:40,259 --> 03:02:42,929
Adam Curry: them this is why
we're never going to be rich.

3042
03:02:45,629 --> 03:02:50,579
Ever, ever, ever ever. All
right. We got a little bit of
