00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,980
Unknown: Oh, no.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,670
Adam: Adam Curry jauncey devora Sunday May 10 2020. This is your award winning gitmo-nation Media

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,990
Unknown: assassination Episode

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,950
Adam: 1200 40.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,140
Unknown: This is no agenda

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:22,950
Adam: on muzzled and broadcasting live from opportunity zone 33 here in the frontier of Austin, Texas capital of the drone Star State in the morning,
everybody. I'm Adam

7
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:30,869
John: Curry in from Northern Silicon Valley where everybody's wearing masks. And you know, there's a smile under that mask of John Dvorak. Yes.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:01:03,480
Adam: The right topic off the bat. I am on muzzled, I will not be muzzled, and you don't have to be muzzled. The official word is in wearing a mask in
public is not desired. This is Dr. Anthony Fauci on 60 minutes, right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks, you're
sure of it, because people are listening really closely to them.

9
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:39,059
John: And right now, people should not be worried there's no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you're in the middle of an outbreak.
wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better. And it might even block a droplet. But it's not providing the perfect protection that
people think that it is. And often there are unintended consequences. People keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face, then can
you get some schmutz is sort of staying inside their horse, of course, but when you think mask, you should think of healthcare providers needing them
and people who are ill.

10
00:01:39,630 --> 00:02:10,320
Adam: There can be no question. No mask, and as a handy resource. I have made no masks.org. And if you go there, I shall do with myself. No masks.org
you will see a copy of that video, you will have an audio there. And you can bookmark and bookmark that as a handy little resource when someone gives
you crap. And you say oh yeah, look at Tony Fauci, bitch.

11
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,140
John: I like to wear you put a byline on it.

12
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,680
Unknown: Hey,

13
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,550
Adam: it's not really by design. It's otherwise you can't have a title without the byline. That's just some way this is

14
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,740
John: a cheap generator.

15
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,910
Adam: No, excuse me, this is the freedom controller not some cheap generator.

16
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,060
John: Thank you very much. It's your controller you should be able to have it

17
00:02:39,270 --> 00:03:16,680
Adam: should be able to control it. Yes, I know. I know. I'm working on it. I'm working on it. Anyway. So there it is. That is the definitive answer.
It is from May 6. Nothing has changed since then. Fauci, in fact, is not even on the scene. He is in quarantine. How handy is that? When everybody
wants to just when everybody wants him to testify. All of a sudden, ya know, I Ts someone was exposed. So I have to self quarantine. It's just one of
those coincidental little things. It's kind of fun.

18
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,490
Unknown: timing.

19
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:26,160
Adam: So everyone is not walking around here in a mask. I would say about 50% of the people.

20
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:49,380
John: Yeah, well, you have you should probably sounds maybe it could be right. I mean, here it's 100%. Yeah. Except some of the homeless and they're
not walking around in messages yelling at people. Yeah, and shaking their fist. Everyone else is wearing a mask. happily. They're all happily wearing
masks.

21
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:59,940
Adam: This is this is so not a good idea. The more I think about it now that now that we have the official medical advice. I mean, you agree with me,
right? That is the guy who makes the call.

22
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,470
John: Correct. He is the referee. Oh, okay. Yes, he's

23
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:20,190
Adam: the referee. He's the guy that makes the call. He said no mask. It was very clear. We have a mask ordinance in Austin, which is illegal because
the state overruled it. But still they're gonna try and shame you and do all kinds of

24
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,770
John: Democrats. I

25
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,500
Adam: don't know if it's just because the democrats This is what

26
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,640
John: is reason around here.

27
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,260
Adam: It's something in the water and

28
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,840
John: the republicans Try not to

29
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,110
Adam: you think that's the delineation? It's not just people who are

30
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,060
John: won't be mythologized? Yep.

31
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:56,490
Adam: Yeah. Yes. Sadly, you're probably somewhat right. But but the protest is everywhere. People want to they want out, they're done. They don't want
to hear it anymore. They want to get back to work. They want to get back to life. They're just not taking it anymore. boots on the ground Pennsylvania
from one of our producers gonna

32
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,360
John: kill people.

33
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:26,729
Adam: People have had enough The overwhelming majority of deaths in Pennsylvania have been in nursing homes. The hospitals were never overrun. In
fact, they are furloughing people and hospitals are losing money by the billions due to canceled elective surgeries. not unique to Pennsylvania. We
were told that even with social distancing, there was a huge chance would overload the simple system, and it simply didn't happen. And yet, the
governor just extended the stay at home order until June 4, without any data to back it up.

34
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,320
John: 3457 are down,

35
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,840
Adam: man, the day that eight comes I'll be I'll be hooting and hollering seven cars Step seven car economy on

36
00:05:37,920 --> 00:06:22,920
John: we have a we have a friend that works for NHS. And she says that it's same thing hospitals are empty. I suppose it must be a pocket someplace
where there's a full hospital full. And she says what's pathetic, is that people like there's one example recently there's this big empty hospital
places big is empty. And some guy had a stroke. So they brought him in, but because of all the rules his wife or nobody can see him so he's stuck in
there by himself. And he's half out of it. And he's wondering where everybody is. He's wondering if he's dead. My dad, where's my wife and my dad and
he's just pathetic. She says this is so sad. And this is going on all over the Great Britain with this these people because you can't just

37
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:39,630
Adam: go and see him. So if your assertion is correct, and I'm going to say in California I bet it is that it's political. The mask is a political
thing. That is so a

38
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:48,210
John: political group because the people who were the master responsible and the people don't wear their masks and want to kill everybody now horrible
Republican. Okay. So

39
00:06:48,240 --> 00:07:00,270
Adam: you could say that both of these groups are acting rather cultish. Right, one says, We're the smart cult and you got to wear the mask and the
other says we're not a part of the cult and they have their own cult I guess.

40
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,470
John: You know true. I don't think that non match words are not part of a cult.

41
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:12,869
Adam: Okay, well that even strengthens this argument Truthstream media put together a cool little video it's in the show notes and a show notes calm

42
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,520
John: it's just a talking cat.

43
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:51,780
Adam: No, it's not the talking cat. Like as good though. Ladies and gentlemen. Do not despair. No agenda show has the talking cat coming up in just a
moment standby. They did a bit on cults and how people are initiated so initiation rituals into cults. So they, they kind of mashed up the idea of
what's going on now with the video while reading a very traditional piece of work about initiation rituals in the cult. And I just picked up this one
minute clip from it

44
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:59,220
Unknown: necessary for new members to function properly in the society they are being inducted into are all imbued at this time.

45
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,550
Repetition is typical, as its use helps hammer the spell home.

46
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:18,330
the wearing of masks may be required. masking has traditionally played an important role in rituals of this kind.

47
00:08:44,040 --> 00:09:06,360
Enabling and hastening the suppression of ego to help facilitate a death of the old identity before the identification with and manifestation of a new
one. Disguised under a mask and hidden away the initiator is more easily able to transcend the self pushed further toward that invisible line between
the physical and spiritual realms.

48
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:22,319
Adam: I'm all in on this now um, so I this this mask thing no no this mass thing is a very bad idea. It's a very bad idea people have to wake up to
what's going on here we're so preconditioned forget just

49
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:35,550
John: how bad I think it is. Especially around here. Ya know if you see it there, but I'm sure you do. You have these morons. And I'll use the term
driving in their cars by themselves with a mascot.

50
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,900
Adam: Yes, john. We have

51
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,520
John: a windows are up.

52
00:09:38,580 --> 00:10:29,640
Adam: Yes, we? Well, you don't want the ronin to fly in and hit you in the face. Do you know and also the air is off? No, no, you can't have any air
on it's just your hot box and down the road with your mask. I've seen it. Yes, I've seen it. So we make kind of a sport of it now to see okay. Did you
go in without a mask? Yeah, hell yeah. I did. The people aren't yelling yet they're not not yelling yet. But anyway, the preconditioning that producer
Justin, who's obviously a gamer or he was a gamer around 2000 said, there's so much stuff that has been in the, in the psyche. For so long. This is
the game DOS, dos x that gets some kind of combat game whenever and here's a little clip your appointment to FEMA should be finalized within the week.
I've already discussed the matter with the senator.

53
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:36,960
Unknown: I take it he was agreeable. He didn't really have a choice as he'd been infected. Oh, yes.

54
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:50,670
Adam: Most certainly when I mentioned that we could put him on the priority list for the Ambrosia vaccine. He was so willing, it was almost pathetic.
This play, the writing's intensifying to the point where we may not be able to contain it. Why contain

55
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:57,750
Unknown: it, let it spill over into the schools and churches Let the bodies pile up in the streets in the end they'll beg us to

56
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,320
save now.

57
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,640
Adam: That's going on for a while. Deus Ex actually I mispronounced it?

58
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,690
Unknown: Oh yeah, she

59
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:24,120
Adam: has this but how different how different does it sound from New York City? This is producer Nick who caught the giant voice recording going off
to as people were starting to kind of congregate getting too close to each other you know, wanting to say something to their government.

60
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:50,010
John: Yeah, this is reminding me I guess. You will be ticketed and Yo,

61
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,290
Adam: the red zone is for Park is

62
00:11:53,070 --> 00:12:02,280
John: ticketed and towed. And you hear that? What kills me about that announcement at the airports? They play it inside the airport.

63
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:14,820
Adam: Only a JFK though. Don't think anywhere else. They do it Oakland. So you've even got Yeah, but Oakland is very small. So it's

64
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:25,590
John: just a bunch of Hicks. Oh golly. marlina forgot to bring the car around just go start outside parked.

65
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:43,590
Adam: So even some of the doctors are fed up with it and are doing the typical kind of stand up presser in front you know in the scrubs in front of
the the hospital doors up on the steps and scrubs. Yeah. Oh, yeah. There you go. Exactly. Exactly.

66
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,900
John: It's presser his press

67
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:51,540
Adam: scrubs. Damn it. I'm on a row presser in scrubs. This is Dr. barchi,

68
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,370
Unknown: one of the experts are wrong.

69
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:09,780
quarantining the healthy doesn't actually save lives. What if wearing a mask in public is not effective.

70
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:47,550
My name is Dr. Jeff barky. And I'm here representing 1000s of physicians across the country whose voices are being silenced. Because we don't agree
with the mainstream media and the experts who are telling us what to do never in the history of this great Republic. Have we quarantine the healthy?
never in the history of this great Republic? Have we told churchgoers that it's illegal for you to exercise your first amendment right? of freedom of
religion,

71
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,750
yet at the same

72
00:13:48,750 --> 00:14:03,570
time, it's essential to keep pot dispensaries open than ever in the history of this country. Have we been told that you can't go to church because
it's not essential? But you can go get an abortion? Because

73
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:29,280
Never before in our country? Have we let criminals out of jail. But we've told you you can exercise your second amendment right and protect yourself
by purchasing a firearm. When liquor stores are deemed essential, but your businesses are deemed non essential. There's something wrong going on.

74
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:36,060
This booklet the declaration of independence in our US Constitution

75
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:44,850
was never designed to restrain the people. It was designed to restrain the government and

76
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,090
Adam: I can inform you The doctor has been demonetised.

77
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,480
John: Dr. is a Republican.

78
00:14:52,260 --> 00:15:02,160
Adam: Well, there's that but he has he has some very valid points and he's he's making his points heard. But there's somebody's got

79
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,700
John: to do it.

80
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:18,060
Adam: But there's a lot of crazy stuff going on with that just even at a local level or the state level. And like in Austin and mayoral level, they
just don't want us to get out. They just want to come up with reasons to keep us in. And now we have the trade

81
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,080
John: at 5g as

82
00:15:19,140 --> 00:16:14,610
Adam: well. Now we have the trace act on the way house House Resolution. Well, and of course it is it you can't make it up. It's House Resolution
666616. Too many. And here's the problem a lot of people have with it. It will authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to
eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19. And related activities, such as contact tracing through mobile health unit, and, and
here comes as necessary at individuals residences, and for other purposes. So they're putting together a tracing squad. $100 billion is the proposal
for this. And it will be Yeah, exactly what it sounds like a form of a,

83
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,640
John: like the EU regulation like

84
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:28,350
Adam: an army. And so if if you've been identified as someone who may have been in contact, and they come to your house and test you and take
measures, so what could these measures be?

85
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,420
John: Well, it's out of the house and lock

86
00:16:30,420 --> 00:17:56,160
Adam: you up. That's correct. And this is Dr. Robert Levin, he is the health secretary of what's his name here, a health director of Ventura County,
California. And here he is talking. And when you listen to him speak, just and I left a little more in this than I would have at the beginning.
Certainly, he's like Mr. Rogers. And he's, and I'll even have to interrupt him, he's so sickly at telling you what's going to happen. I mean, it's a
real doctor, and you just listen to this guy. And what he's talking about is quite concerning. We are beginning a program today. And it's a pilot
program, which will certainly grow into something larger and larger. And that is a community contact tracing program. We've done contact tracing all
along, that contact is a person who's been exposed to someone that we document to have the COVID infection. When we find someone who has a COVID
infection, those people are immediately isolated. But we also work with them to figure out who their contacts, we're just the way he says that, you
know, if you if you have the virus, okay, you can be asymptomatic, maybe you get tested, but the way he makes it sound is like isolated, isolated,

87
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,750
Unknown: immediately isolated.

88
00:18:01,439 --> 00:19:25,259
Adam: Luckily, because you have been doing such a great job of cooperating and staying indoors, and staying isolated, you've been such good little
obedient servants and slaves. It used to be, there were 10 contacts, at least for every patient that we would find. Now, it looks like there are
probably only two or three or four contacts. Not surprisingly, so good of you very good human resources. By the way, the guy is not doing an
interview, he's speaking on stage. This is how he speaks to his his County, his his subjects, because most people have been staying away from others.
So that's, that's good news. But the purpose of this program is to bring on people, we're going to start with 10 people, we may bring on up to 50, or
even more just a pilot project after all, as the program grows, and as we see the needs for it. As we do more testing, we will find more and more
people who have COVID 19. And again, we'll isolate every one of them, and we will find every one of their contacts. We also realize that as we find
more contacts, some of the people we find, are going to have trouble being isolated. For instance, if they live in a home,

89
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,200
Unknown: where there's only one bathroom,

90
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:48,180
Adam: and there are three or four other people living there, and those people don't have COVID infection, we're not going to be able to keep the
person in that home. Every person who were isolating, for instance, needs to have their own bathroom. And so we'll be moving people like this into
other kinds of housing that we have

91
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,020
Unknown: available.

92
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:53,159
John: Oh, I want you to put him in those empty prison cells. No,

93
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,150
Adam: no, no, no, no, no, listen, don't call the prison cell anymore.

94
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,880
Unknown: They'll also have other needs, perhaps

95
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:51,390
Adam: Food, whatever it's gonna be, the county will be there to back them up and to support them. Yeah, I think you're right. It's a prison. So that's
exactly where you're going. And so, you know, when you hear this and you hear you see this bill that is coming our way, you gotta think the guy's
pretty happy about it. It's like, yeah, I'm gonna get funded perfect reminds me of this a little bit to think about intelligence work takes place
within a strong legal framework. We operate under the rule of law and are accountable for it. In some countries, secret intelligence is used to
control people in hours, it only exists to protect the freedoms, protect the freedoms, protect the freedoms, protect the freedoms and that's why we're
doing and citizen is to protect your freedoms Have no fear.

96
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,430
John: It's gross. Okay, that's

97
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:34,830
Adam: that unfortunately is seems to be where we're headed. Now we were looking for some names for me for some reason that that really hit a mark and
let me see where I have this people started coming up with all kinds of cooler names for tracking so that we could kind of sell it a bit better. So we
have social interactive safety social proximity awareness when we need something for these troops we need a name for them to social density squad.

98
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:47,460
John: I had one I forgot to write it down because somebody wrote one and i thought was quite good there's a bunch of them yeah, we should put a web
page together and you can put by Adam Curry on it

99
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:49,500
Adam: screw you

100
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,070
John: go to it

101
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,080
Adam: anyway I had a very infected I

102
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:05,160
John: oh yes you had a big eyeball was swollen up and you couldn't even barely see through it it was causing problems with the show show

103
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:26,970
Adam: actually suffered? Yes, I there were certain buttons I could not hit with accuracy my eye hand coordination and gotten thrown totally out of
whack. So after three days of you know as the eyelid was all swollen then the socket was a big boxing match. Yes. On the on the losing end of the
match. And so now my whole face is kind of swelling up and like all right, now we got this.

104
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,180
John: You already have a big hit.

105
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:34,230
Adam: Oh, no, I don't. It's the hair. That was my secret.

106
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,910
John: And by the way, Little Richard died and talking about a guy with a big head. Yeah,

107
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,820
Adam: Little Richard man he did a lot a lot for America.

108
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,940
John: You really bamboo.

109
00:22:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Adam: Yeah, he did a lot. Anyway. So you know, being a podcaster the you know, the insurance scene is not all that easy. And a while back the keeper
and I found this new outfit from it's actually a couple of Silicon Valley guys. It's called decent that we may have talked about on the show. And that
they basically give you $500 a month per person disaster insurance. But you know, they they do chip in for some medication and stuff. And whatever it
you know, if something bad happens, you know, I'll have to figure out the $8,000 deductible. From there the insurance kicks in. And besides, I
typically go to Dr. Rom the Voodoo doctor anyway, it's not covered. So but one of their selling points is unlimited telemedicine appointments. So I
think Well, here's my chance, I'm going to have to do this, which of course, involves downloading the app, which I have a special phone for which is
goes off after the usage. downloaded the app and I have to tell

110
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,770
John: you Wait, hold on a second. You can't do this on your regular computer. Yes, you can.

111
00:23:52,800 --> 00:24:04,770
Adam: You can. Can you can. There is a link and everything. Like I wanted to have the full experience so I could report on it on the show. This is the
new hot thing. telemedicine and up on the screen pops up Dr. Sam.

112
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,140
John: Robot duck?

113
00:24:07,170 --> 00:25:13,710
Adam: No, no, I think he may have been. He's maybe Turkish descent, but he's in Vegas. And he owns the telemedicine company. He's also the CEO and he
had a bow tie, which tells you he's an inventor. And that that was fun. He's invented a device that you connect to your phone and then he can listen
to your heartbeat and take your temperature and god knows what else maybe stimulate stimulate you. But I have to say I had a really good experience
with this. And he says, you know, the thing is we can talk as long as you want. There's no limit. And and he told me I didn't say confidentially, but
anyway, he said that he only charges $10 per telemedicine visit to the insurers. It says you have no idea how we make it up on Volume Two, we've got
10s of 1000s of customers and the calling with pretty simple things. And for me, it was like, Okay, I see why you're calling the guy. Do you see the
problem? You know, three questions and then pop get the drops. And by the end of the afternoon, it was already starting to clear up. I was impressed.
I'm not a guy who likes to go to the doctor for anything.

114
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,890
John: Yeah, well, it's not it's a dangerous place.

115
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:34,620
Adam: It's a very dangerous place. That was quite Yeah, I, there's something to it. And I and these guys are trying to figure out a different business
model by making it more affordable. I don't know if they're actually making money, but it certainly is a hell of a lot cheaper than lots of other
routes I've seen

116
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,810
John: and your eyeballs. Okay, my

117
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:41,880
Adam: eyeball is doing quite well. Thank you got some antibiotics. And I'm rocking and rolling.

118
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,610
John: Well, what did he tell you what this problem was?

119
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:46,919
Adam: what my problem

120
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,750
John: was wrote the eyeball.

121
00:25:48,780 --> 00:26:07,560
Adam: Yes, he had a name for it, which I promptly forgot. But it is essentially inflammation of the eyelid from allergies, histamine. And then and
then you rub it and then if you rub it, then he gets screwed up and you're screwed. Yeah.

122
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,480
John: Texas syndrome.

123
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,540
Adam: Yes. Indeed, Texas syndrome.

124
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,530
John: Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna bet you're better. Yeah,

125
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:21,900
Adam: I feel good. I have a phrase that I think we will be hearing

126
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,400
John: the phrase from the chaise,

127
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:41,939
Adam: no, I think Well, no, it's gonna be a phrase from the future. And I've read it a couple times. And I'm like, wow, are they really pushing this?
And maybe I'm wrong. But the recovery through prevention, which is just the most Newspeak I've ever heard, recovery through prevention, which of
course, you know, what that leads to?

128
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,990
John: Yeah, lucky in jail, let the pressures out. You

129
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:52,500
Adam: know, the vaccine, of course, it leads you straight to vaccines. Yes. Exactly. vaccines,

130
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,360
John: which play that earlier

131
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:21,810
Adam: clip? Well, I'm gonna play this one for you. And this will kind of finalize the getting back to work part. Even though everywhere, everywhere in
the world people are just giving up they're getting they're walking out of their homes. They've had it I mean, they are they just took them this long
it's Amsterdam is Rotterdam, it's the UK is is different. The UK, I think they shoot you on the spot. They're really locked down over there. Hey,

132
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,370
John: I have a couple of UK reports.

133
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:34,920
Adam: Okay, we'll get to it. After we listen to the only way we can get back the only way the world and get back to normal Ladies and gentlemen, we
have to listen to the guru. William gates

134
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:48,870
John: and my lifetime there, this will be the greatest economic kit, but you don't have a choice. People act like you have a choice. People don't feel
like going to the stadium when they might get infected.

135
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,830
Adam: You know, it's not the government who speak for yourself pansy boy

136
00:27:52,860 --> 00:28:12,000
John: saying, okay, just ignore this disease. And you know, people are deeply affected by seeing these dots by knowing they could be part of the
transmission chain and old people, their parents or grandparents could be affected by this. And so you don't laugh it about me?

137
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:24,780
Adam: Well, I think this he's actually laughing because it's a tell some people have brought the hammer down on me and say, no, it's because of his
Parkinson's. Like, well, that may be

138
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:30,059
John: but Oh, okay. When his Parkinson's began about a decade ago.

139
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,490
Adam: Yeah. And they're gone as far as I can see.

140
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:52,409
John: I know, bill before he went, he was still giving speeches about how we make money by selling code. And I've seen and I've seen very young, yeah.
Oh, really, that laugh has always been there. And when and when when he drew the line and the and the inappropriate smile right in the middle of a
sentence. What?

141
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,890
Adam: Right. So what is that then if you've been around it?

142
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:11,190
John: Well, I think that the idea that it's a tell is probably the closest that gets by knowing. I mean, you could say well, it's just a nervous
laugh. But why does it show up when it shows up? Because always shows up at a tell moment.

143
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:21,180
Adam: I think he's giddy about the whole idea. He's giddy about people being afraid he's giddy about the only solution being his Guinea as
vaccinations.

144
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:51,480
John: Well, I think that's a valid interpretation. I could be my knowing they could be part of the transmission chain and an old people, their parents
or grandparents could be affected by this. And so you don't, you know, you don't get to say ignore what's going on here. There are there will be the
ability particularly in rich countries to open up if things are done well over the next few months.

145
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,620
Unknown: For the world at large, normal seat

146
00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:32,310
Adam: only returns when we largely vaccinated. The entire global population and and so, you know, although there's a lot of work on testing a lot of
work on drugs that were involved with, you know, trying to achieve that ambitious goal which has never been done for the vaccine that rises to the top
of the list. This indoctrination from Dr. Bill is so deep that people are buying into it. I think part of this is the reason why even when cuz Fauci
is, he's compromised. He's a Trump guy. He's got Trump goo on him.

147
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,170
John: He's not a Trump. No, no,

148
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:57,480
Adam: no, I think Fauci is now being pushed away. And he's being seen as as a turncoat. Just like Burke's I'm telling you the you should know out
there, Fauci is really, there's questions about him, he won't go to the house first testimony. Now he's at home. Whoo. Now, no, Bill Gates is still
the ultimate guy, he Dr. Bill, he knows everything.

149
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,460
John: People are getting sick of Bill. And you only

150
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,420
Adam: have to ask someone like Sean Penn, who appeared on The View

151
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,870
John: of play who appeared on The View to an outlier and using that as your example. It's still

152
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:25,290
Adam: Hollywood. Its Hollywood. I just want you to hear the programming, Sean Penn. I know Sean Penn, I got remind me one of these days to tell me
sean penn story on the MGM Grand air. But for now, theory is on the view,

153
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:39,660
Unknown: as somebody who has seen government response to crises firsthand, how do you think this administration Sean has been helping and handling
COVID? And what worries you the most? Well, on the federal level,

154
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:58,440
I think that one thing that certainly should be much more robust is in the defense production act. Manufacturing, just listen to it and kits. I
believe that if we had that on the kind of level with which that act was used in the past,

155
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:06,450
Adam: for war efforts, that there'd be no question but that we could test, in fact, multiple tests

156
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,670
Unknown: over a series of weeks to every American, there's no question, we have a model

157
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:26,160
that's that we've been able to push out. And with that, using a combination of local governance and community organizations or NGOs, it would work on
a small municipality level

158
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,820
as it would in a big city for rural areas.

159
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:54,780
Adam: Yeah, no, Shawn, there's no way we're going to get multiple tests for every man, woman and child in the United States. And I gotta appreciate
the guy has local teams, he has a score, I think his name was group and and they do a lot of good things. But no, you're you're drinking the Kool Aid,
man. It's not feasible. But then again, the other one, Oh, yes.

160
00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:09,780
John: Nobody did this universal vaccine, is it the whole world's gonna be vaccinated is never the whole world's never been vaccinated for anything
he's talking about. He's talking about specially when nobody in Africa even trust Bill Gates talking

161
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,970
Adam: about testing now. Not Vax. No, no, I'm

162
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:17,940
John: talking about backing up because you didn't let me get that little jab in there. What bill was to go back go ahead, you

163
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,680
Adam: jab all you want to Dr. Bill

164
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:40,950
John: is bullcrap. Well, Canada is there's gonna be more people marching in the streets against any universal vaccine, Trump, I totally subscribe to
the Trump thesis, which I kind of think where I may know where it comes from. But it's been observed before this thing is just going to go away. It's
not gonna be here next year.

165
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:49,230
Adam: The Canada is already talking about making the vaccine mandatory for all citizens

166
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,640
John: of Canada, this guy's will probably bend over and

167
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:58,980
Adam: hey, not all Candida avions. Not all of them.

168
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,110
John: They know who they are.

169
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:09,480
Adam: I have a second part of this if you just want to laugh a little more. The fear has also been that all we do the fear

170
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,709
John: mob. This shows you that not Bill Gates, the

171
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:27,269
Adam: Yeah, that is kind of what we do. This shows you what right what the programming does if you only listen, he's appearing on the view. You have
to think he's probably getting his input from one sided sources at this point.

172
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:29,069
John: Shawn?

173
00:34:29,189 --> 00:34:38,039
Adam: Yes, yes. So you know, his fear level is also at a point that is just off the scale and unwarranted. Well,

174
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:41,669
John: I don't think you saw this. He looks nervous and scared.

175
00:34:41,729 --> 00:34:42,659
Unknown: Not at all.

176
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,400
Well, I don't think we need to

177
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:55,050
attach a face a personality or what somebody was sending on their social media to be able to identify an active shooter. An active shooter is anything

178
00:34:55,469 --> 00:35:24,179
John: that is continuing to to kill people. Our brothers and sisters and fathers and daughters and sons. This is this virus is the active shooter. And
if we were at, I think that we can wrap our head around it in that way and understand that it's principally putting in the radical people of color
elderly people, there you go, people. It's racist, randomly selecting all of us.

179
00:35:25,470 --> 00:36:02,970
Adam: But you see what he's doing their keys. And the way I hear it, and I think I'm hearing what he's thinking is this is active shooter and look at
it, he almost ate, it would have been better if you said, and active shooters also target black people. That's almost what he's saying. Programming is
so deep on that man. Anyway, with the weather without the vaccine, it's all going to be okay. Especially in New York. We're going to get get back.
We're going to bring our city back. And we're going to bring in the best people to help our children when

180
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:15,120
Unknown: we are reopening schools. Let's open a better school. And let's open a smarter education system. And I'm going to thank the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation will be working with them on this project

181
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,640
is a visionary

182
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:24,810
Adam: mofo is in everywhere. He's like, Hey, we got a city down, sitting down, bring in the Scholastic services.

183
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:27,599
Unknown: Common Core that

184
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:34,470
Adam: was common. He can repurpose Common Core, but less he's a genius. I just need Cuomo was just another

185
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:51,210
Unknown: Bill Gates is a visionary. And his ideas and thoughts on technology and education. He's spoken about for years. But I think we now have a
moment in history where we can actually incorporate and advance those ideas.

186
00:36:51,240 --> 00:37:00,960
Adam: Yes. So the next time windows acts like a bitch, just think Bill Gates manual. No, that's why we worship him. That's why

187
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:29,879
you can't make it up, you cannot make it up. You can't. Now I'll take you into your UK clips metadata controller, I'm going to take you into your UK
clips. Here's what we're going to do. I've got a clip from the UK. But first, some feedback on the stochastic model. And the assessment there of the
Neil Ferguson, Imperial College model.

188
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:37,680
John: And you recall me Neil Ferguson, the guy who is shacked up with his mistress when he was supposed to be Yes, sheltered in place.

189
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,869
Adam: Yeah, that's the one. That's the one, the guy who was overestimated quite a lot of numbers throughout

190
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:48,059
John: the run sheet that that'd be 2 million deaths, United States, we got 2,500,000

191
00:37:48,089 --> 00:39:16,919
Adam: in the United Kingdom alone. Yes, that guy. And if you recall that he built these models, not on rock and roll, but on 13 year old undocumented
code, and we had the lockdown skeptics.org. And they reviewed the code, and they had some interaction as well with the college to figure out that some
questions back and forth. And one of the things that came up was, it was the stochastic part was, and I really didn't have the capability to analyze
it properly. But what you and I thought was, wait a minute, if this thing is returning random results, then something's wrong with it. And we were
partially right. And I just want to read this one paragraph from producer Richard who analyze what's going on. And he says, the model, and this is
what the article says, or the paragraph, the model and elsewhere, it's a simulation. And of course, with the simulation, you do want some random
factors being thrown in. But he says this certainly looks like a poorly written one in that in addition to the intentional pseudo randomness
underlying the simulation, there are additional hardware and configuration dependencies that cause the results to differ. I would not call these
latter random or stochastic in the statistical sense, because despite its flaws, if the code would run multiple times on the same hardware in the same
configuration with fixed random number seeds, the results would be identical, at least in single thread mode. This is how stupid This is Ferguson's

192
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:33,119
attitude about is very poor. And he says, admittedly, we're partially right about the model about it, the pseudo randomness of it. So bottom line,
this model is shaky.

193
00:39:35,250 --> 00:40:07,380
John: At best, like it's, it's the you know, this is the whole thing, and I don't want to again, I'm not I'm sounding like idealogue. But this is the
same kind of thing is you have a global warming, these mediocre models and they go on and on with these models, and then they make decisions based on
their lousy output. And that's what we've have right now at this stupid thing and this month. On the Imperial College, whatever that is not Oxford.
It's not it's not Manchester. I mean, what is this place? very

194
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,700
Adam: influential they,

195
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:35,160
John: apparently Yeah, because the whole world's been shut down because of their their PR ad models. And this is what's going on with global warming
to which people will never listen to these people have never had a science. They've never taken a course in science, but they're all the big experts.
And so all the media people, none of them have ever they can barely get through a sociology class. But here they are talking about these computer
models and how the gold is going to it's melting the world's melting. It's not just unbelievable.

196
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:58,920
Adam: And it's not just the models, it's the actual data itself. We are hearing numbers of dead people, ranging from 37,000 to 72,000. We don't really
know what dead is. And the CDC has a history of exaggerating numbers of dead we go back to 2000 from the movie super from the documentary supersize me

197
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:34,680
Unknown: and at the time, there were headlines trumpeting everywhere that obesity was soon to overtake smoking as the number one cause of preventable
death in this country. The head of the CDC, Julie Gerberding went before Congress and issued big warnings. And there was a big uproar over the number
of deaths that were to occur. Basically, what they did was divide their survey samples between people who are obese and people who are not obese, and
then basically looked at rates of death. Now, if you are obese and you died from a snake bite, they would say that it was your obesity that was
causing your death, not the snake bite, and sound familiar was part of a little statistical Hanky Panky on their part.

198
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:41,340
Adam: In other news today, the Centers for Disease Control said it made a mistake about the scope of the obesity epidemic in the country. roughly

199
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:59,550
Unknown: a year later, another set of researchers from the CDC offered a much much lower set of estimates. According to their estimates, it was
roughly 25,000 people a year who are dying from weighing too much. Researchers say that mathematical errors exaggerated The death toll. Why did the
CDC inflate the numbers of deaths attributable to obesity

200
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,180
follow the

201
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:33,960
money. I think it's all about funding and bureaucratic mission. When I talked to a few CDC officials, they're constantly preoccupied about how much
money the government or Congress is going to allow for them for the next year, and they're constantly worried about getting their funding cut to
follow the money. All of this might have gone unnoticed, except for the anti tobacco people who see this as a zero sum game. So they see that if
obesity becomes a big public health issue, it's going to crowd out funding to tackle smoking as a public health issue. So they were among the first
people to point out a lot of the methodological problems in the estimates relating obesity to public health

202
00:42:33,960 --> 00:43:06,480
Adam: outcomes, until they're just a bunch of lying corrupt douchebags. And they do it all for the money for their own projects for their own grants.
There's so much money and Health and Human Services is an incredible I mean, Fauci little teeny, teeny weeny division is $11 billion. And we heard
from one of our producers john you were on the email who knows people in in the business and and they hate that what they what they call the flu
people. The flu people they get all the money it's always the flu people within a we

203
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:23,010
John: also pointed out in that note that the flu numbers are probably exaggerated because we're always talking about over 60,000 60,000 dead from the
flu, the seasonal flu is killing 30 to 60,000 people. And it debt number may be exaggerated

204
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:51,210
Adam: a lot. It seemed it appears that well. RFK Jr. is all over this. He says maybe 1000 people a year die from the flu. He says it's a lie. It's
just a lie. He says but it's a big moneymaker for the that, by the way, was the first question. Adam, tell me about yourself. You're 55 Okay. When's
the last time you had your flu shot? First question out of the gate. And I say never any went Okay, next question.

205
00:43:51,630 --> 00:44:10,980
John: Actually, that's funny, cuz I've had a question asked me. And, and as soon as you said my gonna get one. They don't even lecture you about it. I
made sure. It says no, they asked this question gratuitously. Oh, no. Because if they were serious about when they say, well, you should get one. No,

206
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:15,210
Adam: no, no, all they have to do is put the black check mark in the database.

207
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:20,639
John: Well, that's what I mean by gratuitous they're just doing it for the someone. The black check mark. So they've done their

208
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,580
Adam: job. Yes. And they're and they follow the

209
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:30,720
John: same exact same, by the way, no offense to the doctors out there. But how is that any different than would you like fries with that?

210
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:37,620
Adam: The way they ask it? Yeah. What size?

211
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:50,160
John: Because it's not as though the french fry guy at McDonald's or wherever it is. pushes it. They don't say would you like fries? Or they say no.
They say, Oh, you should they're great. No, but they're not. It's

212
00:44:50,159 --> 00:45:47,849
Adam: not entirely true because then it would be McDonald's saying Excuse me, sir. When's the last time you had fries? fries? Isn't it time for a
tasty fry, aren't you You're hungry. Alright. So clearly the CDC has had issues in the past. And there's so much confusion, we cannot trust any of
this data. So who knows? It could be 1000 people, it could be 100,000 people we don't know. We don't know there's some average. But it seems to be a
heck of a lot less than we were scared into staying home for now, did this work. And you too, and I put that chart in the in the show notes of the guy
who took the data before the lockdown after the lockdown looked at all the death rates of all 50 states and charted them. And it shows statistically,
if I understand that, and I'm not a statistician that there's pretty much no difference between in the death rate between staying home or not staying
home. You saw this graph, right?

213
00:45:47,849 --> 00:46:29,459
John: Yes, this graphs been going around, it was all over Twitter. And it indicated that based on the early numbers, and if he's projected outward,
distaste that said we're not locking down and the status is we're locking down there with the graph goes exactly as it would if they if they even
switched positions. Yeah. diblock down didn't do anything. In other words, that Meanwhile, we're still locked down and worried sick, because we have
again, a lot of democrat governors who are scared. If they lift a lockdown. Oh my god, I'm gonna be blamed for somebody's death. Yeah, they're gonna
point the finger at me. It's gonna be blood on my hands. But even crazier

214
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:47,100
Adam: is if you look at New York, and the numbers appear to show that over 60% of the people infected got infected while they were at home, locked
down. But that doesn't sit well with the media. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, that can't be true.

215
00:46:47,159 --> 00:47:23,009
Unknown: We certainly hope so. I want to put up a quote from Governor Cuomo in New York, which which sort of had some surprising information in it. He
said, 66% of the people who were in new cases, were at home, which is shocking to us. He said, this is a surprise. Overwhelmingly, the people were at
home. We thought maybe they were taking public transportation and we've taken special precautions. But actually, no, these people were literally at
home 66% of the new cases. How does that happen? Well, generally speaking patients report and this has been well established better and safer
behaviors than reality.

216
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:26,849
They may be staying at home, they're lying.

217
00:47:26,999 --> 00:47:36,719
But in fact, we know 600 people got the infection during pretty harsh sheltering conditions in the New York area. How did that happen? That means they
got the infection during the extreme measures.

218
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:45,899
Adam: Dude, this they can't even take any kind of news in any other light. Can they? These people dead liars. Oh,

219
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,130
John: we got an agenda. We're gonna

220
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:52,290
Adam: call it liars, liars, liars, liars. liars. Anyway, I promise to get you into the UK. I'm gonna play

221
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,940
Unknown: what are you gonna wear? I'm

222
00:47:53,939 --> 00:47:54,479
Adam: sorry, I

223
00:47:54,869 --> 00:47:56,189
John: got checkmark. I

224
00:47:56,189 --> 00:47:56,579
Adam: know.

225
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,380
John: He's gone off the rails.

226
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:16,829
Adam: I am off the rails. I'm just gonna pull a hard left. Katie Hopkins, on Sky. Luckily, at least they can talk about the Neil Ferguson guy and his
multiple mistakes. And only in typical British fashion. Can they rip a guy down the way Katie Hopkins does in this clip.

227
00:48:16,860 --> 00:49:50,550
Unknown: Unbelievable. So there's this bid scientist who's the typical science type. He looks like the sort of guy nobody would want to sit next to at
a wedding. He's called Neil Ferguson. And he's basically the guy that was the he was the one that made it such that the UK was locked down. He's
called Professor lock down. He was the one that came up with the modeling that persuaded Boris Johnson that we all had to be shut away and put under
house arrest in our homes. He said 500,000 people might die in the UK because of Coronavirus Now, what that he then did a once he had the rest of us
locked down. He got his mistress, his married lover, a woman funnily enough called Mrs. stats. So for a guy who does modeling and statistics she's
called back he had over and Professor pants down got his pecker out on a number of occasions to you know, help entertain Mrs stats whilst the rest of
us were locked out. So number one, massive hypocrisy as per usual. Number two. He is known for being absolutely crazy with these models like 500,000
deaths. we're nowhere near that number. He predicted 200 million would die from the bird flu I believe it ended up being 242 like his modeling is
about as accurate as my five year old standing up to take a pee. So why were listening to him at all I don't know. And now Professor pants down has
got his toddler out whilst the rest of us are in lockdown. So frankly regular Blitzer had enough.

228
00:49:50,909 --> 00:49:52,379
Whoa, you got

229
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:15,870
John: to play in that clip really because we played a Katie Hopkins clips Two shows ago, where she's bitching about the same guy but before the
mistress story, and she used the same story about her daughter little boy trying to pee standing up. Oh, I forgot about recycling some of her gag. Oh,
boo, boo hoo.

230
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:27,540
Adam: Well, we should report that to the Sky News division is fake news. It's old news is no good. We can't have that. Alright, so here Here we are in
the UK. Welcome. It's your turn.

231
00:50:28,139 --> 00:50:43,529
John: Okay, well, I don't have anything to compare to that last clip. You pre topped me. go bad. Yeah. Very fun UK restrictions garden centers, they
finally get it open. So they're gonna loosen things up by opening up the garden centers

232
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:57,750
Unknown: of any major loosening of restrictions. garden centers, though in England will be allowed to open from Wednesday. It's part of first step
measures. But with the sunlight this weekend, many people are already ignoring some of the restrictions still in place. As Rebecca Williams reports

233
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:10,380
the sun's out and you'd be forgiven for thinking lockdown is over. Despite the odd reminder, mixed messages and little information from the government
are making it feel like the country starting to move again.

234
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:16,860
Definitely needs to be lifted, roundabout now. Like a lot of the people are not really sticking to the rules anyway.

235
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:22,230
I think he should go as far as he can to reduce it. I think people have been very good so far.

236
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,050
But I think there's a tipping point. You feel

237
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:33,000
a bit weird. That gets contradictive the feeling of are we allowed to be outside now Are we allowed to do more than one exercise a day

238
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:37,800
it is gonna be easy, but it's already happening. So it would be very strange if he says the opposite.

239
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,050
It's not a holiday.

240
00:51:42,270 --> 00:52:14,220
lockdown most of stuck to the rules but the police have had to come down hard on some. In the West Midlands. This man even strapped blood into a
police officers eyes he was handcuffed, raising fears of contamination. forces across the UK have been patrolling parks and streets. But there are
concerns that this weekend can place added pressure on officers. And it's got its challenges because it's a bank holiday weekend. People people need a
boost I think and it's a great opportunity to commemorate the V Day celebrations.

241
00:52:14,459 --> 00:52:17,129
I knew it's confusing, but the rules are still the same.

242
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:34,019
As the week's Go on, it seems parts of the country are getting busier and busier. And the first four weeks of lockdown the police issued nearly 9000
fixed penalty notices to those flouting the rules for the highest number issued in London, the Thames Valley and also Lancashire

243
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:54,420
John: find areas that they're handing out tickets, yeah 100 pounds I think. And our friend in the UK, the NHS worker she says the real problem that
she's noticing is the what they call the British ism to the curtain Wranglers.

244
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:56,880
Adam: Curtain Wranglers

245
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:12,449
John: these are the old loads that are behind the curtain out their window and they're turning people in left and right narcs yeah narcs and they're
turning people in left to right the cops come over and give you a ticket if the curtain Wrangler called good turns you in and this is going on all
over

246
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:16,170
Adam: the UK. Do you know that we have a huge narc in Texas?

247
00:53:17,789 --> 00:53:19,679
John: I mean a huge dark and dark

248
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:43,379
Adam: Okay, I'm gonna tell you what happened and you're gonna guess who it is. A guy in Texas sent secret shoppers all over Dallas to restaurants who
were opening up to find out if they were complying with reopening guidelines and published today that 96% of Dallas businesses are not complying.
Google the narc?

249
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:48,450
John: Your Mayor Mark Cuban what

250
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:58,680
Adam: Yep, Mark Cuban is a narc Cuban will continue sending out secret shoppers over the coming weeks with visits to hundreds of locations planned for
the rest of the month.

251
00:54:00,659 --> 00:54:02,699
John: How is this a good idea?

252
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:21,360
Adam: Well, he has his own restaurant chains. I think he's invested in fat shack and some other pasta joint but still I mean I don't know he's just
he's someone made him Emperor and he's going around busting narking on in fact competitors

253
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:25,259
John: Wow.

254
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:45,930
Adam: Yes, yeah, I think he is quite the dick. Unless I'm missing something unless I'm missing the point behind it. You know people are struggling
man. And you know, so they're gonna cut corners, do whatever they can to get us back and you're gonna sit around narc on him. Cheese. Wow,

255
00:54:46,020 --> 00:55:05,340
John: that's really a disgusting story. Okay, we'll get back to the UK. Yeah. With curtain Wranglers. Onboard to the to the newspapers, all these
little local newspapers which UK is full of the UK really is a newspaper per country, great, great country is going to be ending pretty soon we can
play this clip,

256
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:24,839
Unknown: predicting the industry could lose over a billion pounds by the end of the year, with circulation falling by around 40%. Since lockdown
started, and ad revenue down between 50 and 80%, what do you have and it's the local papers that are really suffering we,

257
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:36,270
we all want local newspapers are really important for communities and for writing local news and giving guidance to people if they start to disappear
the some already have, I think that's a real problem.

258
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:43,350
One solution being tabled is to legislate to force the tech giants to pay for news. They've

259
00:55:43,349 --> 00:56:07,919
never really compensated news organizations properly for the value of their content shared through those services, and that's accelerated their
decline. And if we do nothing now, in a very short period of time, we're going to see more news organizations go out of business, and more people
increasingly reliant on the sorts of disinformation and low quality news that circulates like a virus through social media and digital users

260
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:14,550
continuing to rise. The physical paper could ultimately be saved by online success stories.

261
00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:27,719
Adam: Now hold on a second, hold on a second. How does this work? How come those How come those guys are all mad at Google it shouldn't Google be
giving them their journalists like they do in America.

262
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:48,989
John: We just take it out of the line that there's once the newspapers go The only thing is gonna be low quality crappy news. And then I'm thinking to
myself do you mean like the BBC and Sky News? The broadcast element completely out of the story. What was the name of their headed

263
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:55,020
Adam: Yeah, what was the name of that outfit that the Google thing where they put in hundreds of

264
00:56:56,489 --> 00:56:57,419
John: the story I

265
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,890
Adam: know I can't remember the name of the outfit I'll find it anyway this shoe This

266
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:17,609
John: is what is called this show they okay so then um, I couldn't get this story so I only have the teaser for it but I can explain the story if for
some reason I just kept I just couldn't get the story but there's the T two T's was UK heli heli payments

267
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:26,159
Unknown: coming up next year on Sky News giving away money to heal a sick economy how so called helicopter payments could be the cure for a global
slowdown.

268
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,710
Adam: Helicopter pain

269
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:43,440
John: what so this is an Ireland and so these are literally the big boy No. Yes. Drone bags of money yes.

270
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:46,319
Adam: Understand they can't just they can't just land

271
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:48,510
John: is thrown it

272
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:59,160
Adam: that I gotta hear that clip again.

273
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:08,759
Unknown: You need to get the whole story coming up next year on Sky News giving away money to heal a sick economy how so called helicopter payments
could be the cure for a global slowdown,

274
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:10,769
Adam: not just the full crap divorce.

275
00:58:10,949 --> 00:58:29,129
John: So I'm telling you, they're throwing bags of money out out of the choppers and it's almost reminds me of like some old movie where the king is
throwing pennies at the peasants and they're following him on his little boys and girls that are waifs and they're all grabbing the coins and the
money off the ground and oh let's go but they haven't

276
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,950
Adam: they haven't actually done this yet have this has not occurred. They

277
00:58:31,949 --> 00:58:37,319
John: showed a video of the chapter. throwing money but bags of money flying out the chopper. Yeah,

278
00:58:37,860 --> 00:59:03,030
Adam: it's crazy. I'm trying to find this now. I want to find some pictures of it. Okay, well, the means are there. There's helicopters with the big
piggy bank underneath me. What are you working on it? Okay, perfect. heli heli payments. Who ever heard of such a ridiculous thing? That is nuts.

279
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:14,340
John: Alright, so I do have some kind of the story which was starting to appear on Thursday. Now it's getting more traction. Is this bright?

280
00:59:14,849 --> 00:59:23,999
Adam: Yeah, this is so this is the guy who will be the whistleblower or he is the whistleblower. Yeah, let's This is good. I'm interested. I'm glad
you're

281
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:50,550
John: showing this. So here's here is the gigantic, like this is a four part or they're all short clips. But this Norah O'Donnell is going to
interview him today. Oh on 60 minutes. And but they took some clips for this Friday news show to tease us under the best clips. So this guy who's a
nude Nick, to say the least. And I don't want to defame him because of his sexual orientation.

282
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:54,419
Adam: What you shouldn't make it has nothing to do we're going to do that. Then why

283
00:59:54,420 --> 01:00:06,510
John: you bring it up. Oh, but he is such an annoying Kind of a character, that and he's over his head, okay, he's a drama queen. All right, there

284
01:00:06,509 --> 01:00:07,259
Adam: you go, that's fine.

285
01:00:07,289 --> 01:00:25,559
John: And so he comes on, as you know, and he's gonna be this is going to be the democrats new Oh, he's going to be the strong man that's going to
take down Trump. And this guy can barely keep it together talking to Nora. So let's listen to that. If you're on the hook. No, it's actually only
three. So let's go with Nora interviews. Right. This is the intro

286
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:47,669
Unknown: right recently led BARDA, that's a key agency created to defend the country. And he says he was removed from his job for putting science over
politics. And he filed a whistleblower complaint earlier this week. And today, a federal agency found reasonable grounds to believe that the
administrative administration was retaliating against bright well tonight, a preview of our wide ranging conversation

287
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:51,269
Adam: buzzin

288
01:00:51,929 --> 01:01:10,469
John: so this guy, you know, this agency No one's ever heard of is making a big fuss and then they're gonna use they're gonna go after another
impeachment with this character, but I think he's weak. Listen to him. He can't even keep it together in this 22 second clip part. Make it partners.
I'm sorry, it's 50 seconds. Part Two tonight.

289
01:01:10,499 --> 01:01:11,669
Unknown: Another No, wait,

290
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:12,720
Adam: hold on that.

291
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:14,939
John: Interview interviews right to

292
01:01:15,179 --> 01:01:25,289
Adam: okay, but we skipped over nor one. I'm sorry. At the wrong one. Okay, here we go.

293
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:28,409
Unknown: The President called you a disgruntled employee.

294
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:50,070
I am not disgruntled. I am frustrated. At a lack of leadership. I am frustrated at the lack of urgency to get a head start on developing life saving
tools. for Americans. I'm frustrated at our inability to be heard as scientist.

295
01:01:51,270 --> 01:02:05,040
Those things frustrate me. As early as January emails show he was sounding the alarm. First about the critical shortage of N 95 masks. We see too many
doctors and nurses now dying.

296
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:15,750
And I was thinking that we could have done more to get this mask and this applies to them sooner. And if we had, would they still be alive today?

297
01:02:15,809 --> 01:02:17,819
Ah, yeah, this

298
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:24,360
Adam: is it. This is this is the beauty. Well, yeah, Trump has blood on his hands.

299
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:32,009
John: He said you get the science meme. sooner. Yeah, he sounds like all the talking points at noon.

300
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:34,500
Adam: He sounds familiar. He sounds like this

301
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,740
Unknown: guy. Well, like I described earlier, there are two

302
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:48,030
fundamental classes that are just a plain fact in society. You either work for someone else, you work for yourself, and most people work for someone
else in a way that they aren't free.

303
01:02:48,809 --> 01:02:51,329
Adam: didn't sound a bit like new noodle sounds like noodle

304
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:57,420
John: boy only talks even slower. I think it was like a dumb noodle bowl. It's noodle boy 2.0.

305
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:08,880
Yeah. And he's a whiner, and he's going to going into tears while he's there. He's like, but it this is so pathetic. Anyway, this part three

306
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:16,770
Unknown: is a horrible thought to think about the time that passed when we could have done something. And we didn't

307
01:03:17,219 --> 01:03:40,619
break claims his persistent warnings caused tension with his bosses at the Department of Health and Human Services. It reached a breaking point when
he raised concerns over the administration's embrace of hydroxychloroquine what he called a drug unproven to treat COVID-19 patients, you believe you
were retaliated against? Because you raised concerns about hydroxychloroquine?

308
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:41,910
Yes,

309
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:43,500
I do.

310
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:59,490
And says he was surprised to learn he'd been reassigned to the NIH to develop diagnostic testing, you'd been sounding the alarm about the lack of
testing platforms. This sounded like an important job. That's an important initiative. Nora, I'm

311
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:25,590
the director of BARDA to take me out of our organization focused on drugs and vaccines and diagnostics, in the middle of a pandemic, the worst public
health crisis that our country is faced in a century and decapitate the bar organization to move me over to a very small, focused project of any scale
of any level importance.

312
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,550
is not responsible to that make sense?

313
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:39,930
Adam: Oh, my God, drama queen is the right question. Where's the right prescription? Oh, my goodness. So what is this bharta organization?

314
01:04:41,969 --> 01:04:45,749
John: If someone is just a subgroup runs on HHS and it's

315
01:04:46,530 --> 01:05:01,470
Adam: biomedical advanced research, biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. Oh, yeah, without those guys, we're toast. BARDA with a D.
That's what it is BARDA with a D. They got it. Yeah. rappi as website two

316
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:24,960
John: yeah this guy's this guy's gonna be their their go to guy and they're gonna do if you see him and listen to them the republicans on those
committees even though they're just going to be house you know so it's going to be led by NAD lawyer and Schiff like the republicans that are on those
committees will eat this guy alive he's gonna be a wreck

317
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:29,100
Adam: wow yeah I don't know how well he'll do

318
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:34,620
John: this interview with your without going into tears this

319
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:56,730
Adam: is this is partly died but this is part of a larger movement that the media is involved in entertainment news hollywood. I have two clips to
back it up unless you want to do more with this but about this particular topic there's blood on his hands. This shows up. This is W gmtv Chicago.

320
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:18,930
Unknown: A new study says the death toll in the US is double what it could have been if governments had responded just a few days earlier. The
earliest stay at home orders were implemented in late March orders to wear face masks began in April. Researchers with Princeton say if these orders
had come four days

321
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:32,640
earlier, the US would be seeing fewer than 1000 deaths a day instead of more than 2000 a day. They point to California which implemented stay at home
orders early and now has fewer deaths per capita than other large states.

322
01:06:32,699 --> 01:06:43,949
Adam: See how that works. That's exactly how it works out. But that hasn't taken it far enough. No for that we need to go to Hollywood. And for that
we need to check in with your girl Amy on Democracy Now.

323
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:56,550
Unknown: A 56 foot billboard called the Trump gas clock has been unveiled in Time Square here in New York, a billboard which created by the Oscar
nominated filmmaker Eugene jerky.

324
01:06:56,820 --> 01:07:00,030
So the Trump def clock is a billboard that hangs over time square.

325
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:05,790
Adam: By the way. This is the same little yo as, as this is blink.

326
01:07:06,059 --> 01:07:45,299
Unknown: And what it shows is an estimate of the number of us COVID-19 deaths that resulted from the President and his team's failed response to the
coronavirus outbreak. thanks to Dr. Fauci and leading epidemiologists, we now know that had the mitigation guidelines been put into effect just one
week earlier, on March 9, instead of March 16 60% of us COVID-19 deaths would have been prevented. That's an incredible number. And on behalf of all
those who needlessly lost their lives, to this failed leadership and a pandemic, we need a symbol, a symbol that cries out not only for
accountability, but also for more responsible and responsive stewardship going forward.

327
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:53,460
At the time of this broadcast, the Trump death clock stands at 46,485 and growing

328
01:07:54,090 --> 01:08:04,590
Adam: the arrogance of this poll right down to Amy's report and growing I am actually speechless it is

329
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:11,430
John: and of course this is the bottom of the den is like sleaze ball tactic it is and Eugene

330
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:54,180
Adam: jerky, who is a respected film directory, you know, kind of more like a Sundance kind of guy, but he has a brand new movie coming out on
Netflix, who have quite a china strategy. So maybe that has something to do with it. I don't know how you get a billboard on Time Square will I do
actually I don't know if you can even get one now if there's businesses being done, but I don't I know who owns Time Square. So this is a Chinese
thing going on with this guy. As far as I'm concerned. He's virtue signaling towards his money people and his backers and whatever else it's
sickening. And then for Amy, Dan's Yep, these pancakes.

331
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:58,680
Unknown: That death clock 46,321. and counting.

332
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,049
Adam: Lady, horrible, horrible, horrible.

333
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:09,960
John: That is the that is yes. That death clock thing is it's a humiliation to the country.

334
01:09:10,889 --> 01:09:12,449
Adam: Speaking of humiliation,

335
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:28,320
John: China, China. Oh, yeah, China's put the death clock up there because they hate Trump. They may be behind this whole thing for all we know, they
can't, nobody's been able to prove it. And now they're doing this bullcrap. Just to get Trump out. Like Joe Biden. Well, let's

336
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:36,300
Adam: have a little listen to the president from the Oval Office. I think the words matter.

337
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:40,410
Unknown: And then we went through the worst attack we've ever had on our country. This

338
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:48,450
is where the worst attack we've ever had. This is worse than Pearl Harbor. This is worse than the World Trade Center. There's never been an attack
like this.

339
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,060
should have never happened.

340
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:53,160
Could have been stopped at the source.

341
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:58,770
Adam: That seems if I were in Beijing, I'd be like, what did he What did he call it an

342
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:00,810
Unknown: attack? Attack

343
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:03,690
Adam: that's very clear language to me I

344
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:36,030
John: don't know if they're gonna keep pulling this stuff like the death clock the giant entity we will say that the Chinese are behind it that
because I think your analysis is correct they're gonna hear more of that because you know they he called the Chinese flu and all this and he backed
off almost overnight because of a phone call or whatever because he does these you know he does negotiates well he's negotiating now they went the
Chinese want to keep just keep the pressure up to get him voted out. Which is meddling by the way. Yeah, in American election,

345
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:36,690
Unknown: please.

346
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,870
John: He's gonna he's gonna desk gonna be jacked up you watch.

347
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:47,430
Adam: Well, let's continue. Let's see what China is doing. Let me see Jimmy Kimmel. What network is he on?

348
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:51,180
John: is under Chinese control Disney network?

349
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:57,420
Adam: Yes, ABC. Let's see what he had in his opening monologue. The

350
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:17,070
Unknown: other night regarding Mike Pence, Harry is with no mask on wheeling boxes of PPS into a health care center. And doing his best to lift them
what a hero, just barely in the door. And since it was going so well, and also because he didn't realize he had a mic

351
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:21,360
on Magic Mike decided to keep it going listening closely here.

352
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:35,610
Adam: You probably can't hear it. But pence literally says to me, how about these boxes? The guy says those are empty, sir. And he says, Well, why
don't we just grab what for the for the TV cameras.

353
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,310
Unknown: Mike Pence pretending to carry empty boxes and peepees into a hospital

354
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:48,690
is the perfect metaphor for who he is. And what he's doing a big box and nothing. Delivering another box and nothing.

355
01:11:49,290 --> 01:12:37,230
Adam: So when I saw the clip, I'm like, Oh my god, how can you How can you fail on that? That's so so blame. And I was looking at it on Twitter, and
I'm gonna give Twitter props. It right underneath the video, it said manipulated media, to like, Oh, that's interesting. I click on it. Then it says
according to some people, this was edited. It's not the way it happened. Well, it is the way it happened. Because there's this is on c span, I put a
link to it in the show notes. There's 20 minutes of pants literally lugging boxes, diving into the back of the van, schlepping them out not letting
other people really help him and they're heavy. He's putting them all down. At the very end. They're joking around. And the guy said now those are
empty. So come on, we'll just do it for the TV cameras after he's actually done that.

356
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:43,860
John: Yeah, well, Kim will apologize before we did. He did Oh, I

357
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:44,880
Adam: didn't know I apologize.

358
01:12:45,030 --> 01:13:12,060
John: But he apologized in an offhanded way. The apology consisted of them saying? Well, it would turn out that the boxes he was carrying were full.
They weren't empty at all. And I'm so sorry that we made this. We This was wrong. From and I hate to say that because of the board. The administrator
was lying all the time. He has to tell us what Johnny has

359
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:35,520
Adam: to because he's got the Chinese Communist Party up his little mouse but like, Hey, be careful there. But here's what's really going on Reuters,
as far as I know, is really the first one to report on it because I think it also is going to have a name pretty soon. The name would be the economic
prosperity network

360
01:13:35,550 --> 01:14:50,970
Unknown: sharpening his tone against China, President Trump said late Thursday, a trade deal between the two was now of secondary importance. The US
leader threatened Beijing with new tariffs as his administration crafted retaliatory measures over COVID-19. Trump's frustration has been growing as
10s of 1000s have died from the virus in the US. The economic contraction as a result also threatens his chances of reelection in November. Two US
officials speaking on condition of anonymity set a range of options against China. We're in the early stages of discussion. Although they added that
recommendations have not yet reached the level of Trump's top national security team or the president. One source said there's a discussion as to how
hard to hit China that could leave the US walking a tightrope in its ties with Beijing. It's currently importing crucial personal protection equipment
from China for health care workers. The multi billion dollar first phase trade deal with China was only signed in January. World stocks pulled back
further on Friday following Trump's comments. While most European markets were closed for public holiday, stocks in London slid over 2% grim data
combined with Trump's threats added to already dented sentiment.

361
01:14:51,570 --> 01:15:41,640
Adam: So this thing is real and it's quite a task force. In fact, the the information coming out is this as a whole of government effort. The very
Well known phrase, of course, but in Trump's case, it might actually happen in which free trade advocates seem to be losing their struggle with the
China hawks inside the administration. Yes, it seems like the globalists are losing out this time. And I was listening to a globalist who I happen to
like where is my globalist buddy here? This is Elon Musk, oh, Ilan. And he was on Joe Rogan. Which was interesting, I think Joe does some of his best
work with with Elon Musk, that that's a very messed up interview to listen to at times.

362
01:15:42,089 --> 01:15:47,639
John: But this was I found this one in pod. Musk seemed something was like something was wrong with him.

363
01:15:48,299 --> 01:16:11,519
Adam: Well, I think he's still trying to figure out how to pronounce his kids own name. You know, that's, that's his problem there. It's like eight x
five, sigma tau. Find by me Ilan. But here's what he was talking about when when, because he has been pretty vocal about the shutdown appears he's
against that appears he thinks it's not a good idea. And this came up in the interview.

364
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:17,220
Unknown: I mean, you look at civilization through the ages. Most of them, you know, the rose and fell. Yeah.

365
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:23,280
And I do think like the globalization that we have,

366
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:33,840
at the sort of like the the meme sphere is, there's not enough isolation between countries or regions.

367
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:37,770
Adam: It's like, if you get up if there's a mind virus,

368
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:42,690
Unknown: that that mind virus can infect too much of the world. You know, like, I

369
01:16:42,690 --> 01:16:43,320
actually

370
01:16:44,520 --> 01:17:04,020
Adam: sort of sympathize with the anti globalization people because it's like, man, we don't ever want to everywhere it will be the same for sure. And
then we we need some kind of like mind viral immunity. So that's his. He's feel some sympathy with the anti globalist people.

371
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:07,080
Unknown: Wow, Ilan.

372
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:20,400
John: That was the worst. The whole interview, he just seemed it did. It was just disconnected. Well, even listen to that clip. It's like, what was he
given? I don't know what?

373
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:43,500
Adam: Well, I think what he was trying to say is that this mind virus where everyone's like, holy crap, we're all gonna die. I mean, it's not just
like something that happened accidentally, it came from somewhere and has been enhanced, a gain of function amplified by the mainstream media. And he
says, you know, how do we how do we stop that? Well, that's basically what globalism does and what it wants.

374
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:51,390
John: But well, I agree with with your you should have been on the show not go back. I

375
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:55,770
Adam: show back on the show. Yes. I have not been invited. Now you will be.

376
01:17:56,970 --> 01:18:07,920
John: Let's go on to a couple other things going on in a couple of cases in the White House. Yes. He made it easy. Oh, it's Oh, this is trying to play
that Nora on new cases. This is a big deal.

377
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:48,809
Unknown: Tonight. Another White House staffer this time a top aide to the vice president has tested positive for Coronavirus Katie Miller, the press
secretary to Vice President Pence is now the second confirmed case tied to the West Wing after a valet who serves the President's meals tested
positive on Wednesday. Miller is married to Stephen Miller, one of the President's senior advisors, and tonight her test is raising questions about
whether the White House is doing enough to distance the president and vice president from others. For his part President Trump told reporters today
the whole concept of tests aren't great because they're his words and he said he's convinced the virus will just go away without a vaccine his own
advisors have said that's not true

378
01:18:55,980 --> 01:19:16,050
John: says it's gonna go away by itself which is seems to be the case with all these previous events you know from bird flu to swine everywhere Yeah,
yeah, I'll buy and I'm my point people say well why would it go away it's gonna come back and say what about SARS? How come that didn't come back?
Yes. SARS we never got an immunity to SARS. MERS Yeah, we never got immunity to murder and then

379
01:19:16,049 --> 01:19:18,929
Adam: you just throw in and how about peak oil? Just throw that in for no reason.

380
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:49,890
John: Really rubbish. What about Peak Oil your others so so Nora says at the end that he precedent says he's gonna be it's gonna go away. And but his
advisors say it's not how do they know? Doesn't matter? No, it's not gonna go away. What? Why does his advisors know more than he does? Because it's
it's a crapshoot. You don't know it's going to go away or it's not going to go away. There's no proof one way or the other,

381
01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:54,000
Adam: but she wants Trump to go away. So that's why she has to report

382
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:01,590
John: this Wow, you're talking now you're getting this just alright. Did this go to new cases in white has just continued to report.

383
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:18,150
Unknown: Oh, But wait, there's more news that one of the Vice President's closest aides Katie Miller tested positive for the virus delayed Mr. penzeys
scheduled trip to Iowa. Miller was not onboard Air Force two, but six staffers who had recent exposure to her had to be removed.

384
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:25,620
Katie, she tested very good for a long period of time and then all of a sudden today she tested positive.

385
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:42,270
Adam: Doesn't matter what you do with Trump, you're the top You're the best. She tested me better than anybody else for negative she was just the best
negative. I mean, when it comes to testing Katie, you couldn't have a better you could not have a better person to be tested with Katie for a long
period

386
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:50,460
Unknown: of time. And then all of a sudden today she tested positive. She hasn't come into contact with me spend some time with the vice president

387
01:20:50,490 --> 01:21:01,470
Miller is with the vice president nearly every day her husband, his senior presidential aide Stephen Miller, President Trump attended their wedding in
February held at Trump's Washington hotel,

388
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:11,610
Adam: despite the potential which by the way, is a great hotel. It's one of the best hotels it truly if you want to test if you want the number one
test, you got to do it the best hotel That's right. That's a we don't mess around

389
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,110
Unknown: Trump's Washington hotel

390
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:14,610
John: even put it in the story.

391
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,830
Adam: That's why I have to bring it up.

392
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:37,650
Unknown: Despite the potential exposure Mr. pence did not wear a mask while in Iowa. We also know that President Trump was in the same room as his
personal White House valet on Tuesday 25th the valet tested positive for Coronavirus. Today, the President still addressed a group of world war two
veterans at a V Day ceremony without wearing a mask.

393
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:43,980
The wind was blowing so hard in such a direction that if if the plague ever reached them, I'd be very surprised

394
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:51,510
that the president says he's now being tested every day and so far is negative. But doctors say that maybe a full sense of security,

395
01:21:51,540 --> 01:22:05,100
somebody could become infected be incubating the virus and test negative every day, including yesterday, then this morning, become infectious, still
feel fine and spread it to other people before the next test shows that they are in fact infected.

396
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:07,170
John: That bastard,

397
01:22:07,200 --> 01:23:25,770
Adam: I'm good. I'm glad that that report at least contained a little bit of V day, which was completely ignored by the American media. I believe you
pointed that out in the newsletter as they did, but it was also very odd to see you know, in the in the Netherlands, which was liberated on on May 5,
but on May 4, they have at eight o'clock this is actually very unique to the Netherlands 8pm. On May 4, all traffic stops. Everyone is quiet. And they
told the bell with a moment of silence two minutes, two minutes and everyone is completely silent. And and I've been in the Netherlands where it was
eight o'clock and on the highway people stopped, just stopped on the highway and then waited, some got out. And then everyone waited for two minutes
of silence and they got in there drove off. So this ceremony has been going on since the end of World War Two. And having the the troops the Yanks and
the Brits, you know coming through in their jeeps it was you know the flags. It was such a joyous occasion. None of it all just quiet. No one on the
street. There no, no parties. I mean, this is this passed by. I think it's a shame how quietly that passed by because of all this.

398
01:23:26,370 --> 01:24:45,690
John: I don't think it's because of all this I think it was in spite of all this. They could have done anything. They could have made a little
presentation on the news or anything instead of all this just nonsense of doing about how Miller was married at the Trump hotel. There was very little
mention of it. By I mean Trump did this little ceremony but the media just dropped the data and want to talk anything about anything that's patriotic.
Well, no, I don't want to do it. I'd rather to me rather brag about the big science talking about how many dead are from Trump. The other thing is,
again, a Chinese influence Chinese do not want the Americans the Chinese by the web and watching CG TV, whatever it is the Chinese outlet constantly,
and their data, most of the globalists are actually coming out of China nowadays because the Chinese actually think they have the opportunity to not
only be for a globalist world, but for them to run the thing. And so a nationalist event like v day which is a nationalist event, because we beat
Hitler of all people and the nationalist event is really frowned upon. And immediate just paid Okay, we'll we will play it up. We won't even mention
it. I don't think half the people even knew it went by.

399
01:24:47,040 --> 01:25:09,600
Adam: You're so right though, and I think we can't hammer it enough when we should probably reiterate, its CCP, the Chinese Communist Party. I don't
know many Chinese people I'm sure they're just like us. I'm sure that they're they're in deeper crap than we are with these a holes. Wanting to show
there's a cool video from some Chinese guy, Chinese American guy that I put in the show notes. And it's the history of China, actually, it's

400
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,010
John: called the I saw that it's very

401
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:35,070
Adam: great. It's called the story of how China ruined everything. And it's 30 minutes. And it's, it's pretty good. I mean, there. It's not complete.
And it's easy to skip over 5000 years here or there. But I was very impressed with that. And you'll learn something from it, it's worth is worth
watching. pompeyo is also out on the road, also, speaking out against China.

402
01:25:36,690 --> 01:25:46,980
John: Like you just before I want to just mention one thing, because these clips about the infections in the White House press is giddy over this
because they're hoping to hope and Trump

403
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:48,600
Adam: gets it. Yeah, they want it. But you know,

404
01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:52,650
John: we can't we can't we can't forget this one element

405
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:55,620
Adam: that we must remember this one element.

406
01:25:56,070 --> 01:26:11,910
John: Trump is a germaphobe. Yeah. And he is delightfully hood of getting it based on some of the earlier reports that we've had on how you do get it.
Trump's never gonna get it unless he kisses somebody with it. Which is always possible.

407
01:26:15,390 --> 01:27:40,890
Adam: Right, the pump pump out, we know for sure that this is actually context, CNBC, the financial news channel, we know for sure that this virus
originated in Wuhan, China and that the disease emanated around the world, the Chinese Communist Party covered this up, we have been working
diligently and are working diligently today to get the Chinese Communist Party to help us identify patient zero where this began, how this came to be.
And this isn't about politics. This isn't about partisanship. This is about protecting Americans tomorrow. This is an ongoing crisis are the world's
epidemiologists still don't know, the origins of this virus. The reason that we continue to ask for transparency and for a reliable partner in China
is because it matters going forward. So not only do we have this current pandemic that's taking place, but we still have to figure out how to get
therapeutics and get vaccines to market all the things that we need this information that only the Chinese Communist Party has in its possession. And
they're the only ones that can help the world resolve this today and for our American Security. But we got to make sure this doesn't happen again. So
I think this is very interesting, if true. He's saying that we can't even make the vaccine without pertinent key information that China is not handing
over. I don't know if it's true, but he's saying it and there should be questions about it. Hey, Fauci, or Hey, Bill, Dr. Bill. Doctor, Professor

408
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:41,340
bill.

409
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:46,230
John: Yeah, that's Yeah, maybe.

410
01:27:46,410 --> 01:27:47,010
Adam: But But

411
01:27:47,039 --> 01:28:02,939
John: well, here's the here's the attack they're not using yet. Which I think could be used. And I think it I think pompeyo could do it well, and it
would be used as leverage to Chinese cases of Corona have dropped to nothing. What do they know that we don't know? That's a

412
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:59,970
Adam: very good way. No, they just say no, Trump, Xi jingping. There's your problem that that's what would come back. Just briefly on therapeutics and
vaccines. On the therapeutic side, I have a beautiful breakdown. From our official no agenda pharmacist. Many people have noticed that New England
Journal of Medicine medicine has published a new observational study regarding hydroxychloroquine. And of course, it turns out to be completely
useless. Why would you even consider using it? But it's interesting because as our official no agenda pharmacist says, below are my favorite parts
which highlight the implicit bias. And the main bias is the patients they took out besides the fact that they had no you know, what do you call it?

413
01:29:00,570 --> 01:29:01,860
Unknown: Double, double bind, no

414
01:29:01,860 --> 01:30:48,690
Adam: placebo, etc. They only took and there was no treatment with zinc. Here it is. The AZT through Meissen suggestion was removed on April 12. The
hydroxychloroquine suggestion was removed April 29. The decision to prescribe either either or both medications was left to discretion of treating
team for each invalid patient. He says our pharmacist says here's the implicit bias, as the only people included in the study were those people who
needed to have moderate or severe disease treated. So they were already in the ventilator stage, which is actually as we know from other doctors who
have successfully used hydroxychloroquine is really too late. You want to use it much, much earlier, almost like Tamiflu. So it's very similar to the
VA study, no placebo One one particular group of people with a certain type of level of illness. I mean, the whole thing is, is broken down in the
show notes. It's under therapeutics, well worth a read. But a lot of people did send in that as well as a lot of people who have sent a very, it's
kind of the same letter or email. It's the debunking of the plan. demick documentary This is the one with Dr. Judy Mike ovitz who has been around for
years and is saying that Dr. Fauci should go to jail for being a criminal. And what's interesting is they all are kind of the same, these responses or
the debunking things, and it attacks her really more for business political reasons how she handled herself with publishing of studies or not really

415
01:30:48,690 --> 01:31:37,590
doesn't address any of the any of the main issues. But the thing that always comes up, which I think is the mistake in this, it seems like it might be
it might be some form of coordinated response. This is literally one of those Hey, Adam, a friend of mine, has a couple of nurse friends or doctor
friends. And here's what they have to say. And then you get a foreword of the email. But it always says in there that Dr. Mike ovitz claims there's
never been an RN, a vaccine. And in every single one of these debunking responses, it's Oh, yeah. Are you kidding me? There's tons of them. There's
vaccines for all kinds of RNA viruses. Yeah, but that's the difference. There's vaccines for RNA viruses. The RNA vaccine that is being discussed,
it's

416
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:40,170
John: actually called m RNA mRNA. Hasn't?

417
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:43,650
Adam: Well, you looked into it right, that you had a thing for me to put in the shownotes.

418
01:31:43,920 --> 01:32:17,460
John: Yeah, that dead paper which discusses the mRNA vaccine wishes, which is a an experimental idea. It's not Do you all the RNA vaccines are based
on the old fashioned way of you, you cultivate the the, the disease, and then you use attenuated versions are killing you grow it and then kill it,
and you do all these different things to make a vaccine just a normal way of making a vaccine. This this mRNA vaccine is a totally different animal.
It's never been proven to work. And so

419
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:18,420
Adam: yeah, so

420
01:32:18,510 --> 01:32:31,950
John: the fact that this show notes, it was a good paper on it, and that's what I when somebody sent me that same exact thing. You got some put some
stooge. And I sent him a link to this to this to this paper, and I said, you read this.

421
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:53,550
Adam: The thing that I like the most is that they said, That's never That's a lie. They've been tons of RNA vaccines like, Okay, this has got to be
someone who doesn't know what they're talking about. So the debunkers are being debunked, but there's about three of them in the show notes under
debunked, you can look it up there any more clips to do in this Rona segment?

422
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:56,130
John: As we're talking about 5g debunking.

423
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:05,100
Let's listen to the talking cat. Yeah,

424
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:07,590
Adam: been waiting for almost an hour and a half.

425
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:16,770
John: Period. She talks here she talks about Fauci and, and it is just a dance I found Fauci reds very well structured.

426
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:23,610
Unknown: The scientific evidence is what needs to drive us and we appreciate the fears of the American people. But we don't want to have policy

427
01:33:23,730 --> 01:33:25,080
that would have negative,

428
01:33:25,110 --> 01:34:10,950
unintended consequences. That's actually fairly reasonable. But that's a quote from 2014 when he was talking about whether or not we should quarantine
for Ebola. Another interesting quote of Anthony as Fauci, MD, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases that the CIA
forgot to scrub from history is when he said that there is no doubt that Donald J Trump President of the United States will be confronted with a
surprise infectious disease outbreak during his presidency. He likely said well, rubbing his hands together and then cackling to the sky for several
minutes. When questioned about concerns for the future, Trump administration, Fauci reportedly said that there was the potential for a new influenza
pandemic and outbreaks of diseases that are not yet on anyone's radar,

429
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:40,620
John: the issue of pandemic preparedness and if there's one message that I want to leave with you today, based on my experience, and you'll see that
in a moment, is that there is no question that there will be a challenge the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases, both chronic
infectious diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease, and we have certainly a large burden of that, but also there will be a surprise outbreak.

430
01:34:41,310 --> 01:34:45,870
Unknown: He has the same Dr. Fauci who according to this Wikileaks email loves Hillary Clinton.

431
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:59,340
Adam: I was a verbatim reading of something but the caps okay the cat cannot just talk the cat can read it's quite astounding. Love the cat and the
cats pretty good.

432
01:35:01,650 --> 01:35:03,240
John: So that's what I have. I have oh

433
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:05,910
Adam: that's that's what you have. You would anyway and

434
01:35:07,890 --> 01:35:09,960
John: I think it might be a good time when you got to

435
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:15,510
Adam: COVID Italy COVID South Korea needed break you want to do anything about South Korea or Russia get

436
01:35:15,630 --> 01:35:16,200
John: cut off?

437
01:35:16,230 --> 01:35:22,890
Adam: Yeah I don't know you're just talking talking at me not listening he's not not obeying me. What do you hear me?

438
01:35:23,610 --> 01:35:25,830
John: Yeah, apparently hit the mute button.

439
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:33,780
Adam: I was asking is Do you not want to do the COVID Italy or Russia? I'm interested in these Oh, that

440
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:38,130
John: was the fault though. Those are the countries run does that we do that the end of the show. Okay. Well,

441
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:46,920
Adam: with that then I'd like to thank you for your courage and say in the morning to you the man who put the seat in curtain Wranglers, john shade.

442
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:56,160
John: What no morning to you. And in the morning the ships at sea and that boots on the ground, the feet in the air and the subs in the water and the
dames and knights out there.

443
01:35:56,190 --> 01:36:19,530
Adam: Yes. And in the morning to our trolls. Let's do a troll count here. Well, 1820 hate trolls hanging in there. Not bad for Sunday. The troll room.
I did a little check in this morning. But the pre show after Darren Oh. And I said How y'all doing? It's mixed. It's not everyone's feeling great.
They're there. People are angry. They're tired. They're sick of it. So I'm we're feeling good.

444
01:36:19,770 --> 01:36:21,420
John: Yeah, there's only so much we can do.

445
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:23,430
Adam: Well, yeah, I know. But he

446
01:36:23,430 --> 01:36:24,990
John: brought the cat on and nobody has.

447
01:36:26,460 --> 01:37:44,070
Adam: If you want to commiserate with your fellow trolls head over to their bridge, you can find that at no agenda. stream.com. We've got a chat there
as well. IRC chat, you can do access on the web. And of course you can listen to anything that's happening live at that moment. A lot of the shows are
live. We're also broadcast live, I believe now on 1430 5am. In Cronin in the northern part of the Netherlands. Oh, nice. Yeah, I love that. I love
just that we're on some random am frequency somewhere in the north of Holland somewhere as great and the more of that the better. If you got a little
transmitter set up, let us know is fantastic. No agenda stream.com and thanks, trolls Good to have you here helping as always, then, in the morning to
the artist for episode number 1240. The title of that was meat must flow and boy does it. And there was controversy from this over this image from
Trent drac who brought us a just a great piece COVID safe no agenda, this crazy ass look and mass, the fonts. Everything was great. And within seconds
of posting the show. The narcissists were out. That's artists who narc I'm looking at you comic strip blogger.

448
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:46,920
John: Oh, he's the he's number one narc. This

449
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:49,860
Adam: is stolen art. You must take showdown now.

450
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:53,610
John: You must change out you will get sued the stolen

451
01:37:53,610 --> 01:38:12,570
Adam: art. So I'm like, oh man, did we get hoodwinked? Because we did an image search we looked for this swing. We found similar stuff. But not
exactly that. And lo and behold, there it is. On some image you follow any of this john Did you follow this going down? I

452
01:38:12,570 --> 01:38:20,520
John: call it the final leg of it. Which is this is a piece of licensed art. The guy has a license. whatever he wants. I love

453
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:30,030
Adam: that he has a license. That's what that is. Now that's a no agenda producer for you right there. I'm not gonna compromise my boys. I'm not
putting the tribe in any dangerous

454
01:38:30,030 --> 01:38:54,150
John: art that you could find it maybe if you searched around now with the no agenda, no stuff on it. And it's been altered like you do with licensed
start but he license a license a lot. Okay, first bring up a couple of There you go. That apparently comic strip bloggers unfamiliar with including
the piece of art that he actually did still some time ago little Santa Claus thing which could have been licensed in but he didn't license now

455
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:54,960
Adam: don't take off.

456
01:38:57,240 --> 01:40:13,560
John: for commercial artists. They license certain kinds of clipart and different kinds of very specialized looking to test to be stylized. And they
will like they will take out licenses from these different places and one or two of them and then don't use this stuff judiciously as projects come
and go. And as part of the deal at this is done with video more even so even more so than it is with art. There's a number of services out there.
There's a couple of MIT Media guys. Meebo itself didn't use them but the guys had licenses and if you watch almost any of the I every time I used to
watch anybody's presentation see the spinning logo come in and flame the big ball booksplosion of flame does all these things come from one particular
site whose name I do always forget I always have to get asked Nick re about it wasn't a minute site again, but is one site just like it costs like $1
to license some of the most spectacular videos that you've ever seen? Yeah. And everybody subscribes to these services. And so we have a couple of
artists, I'm sure more than one. Most of them can listen to the show and do live art on this fly. But we do. This is an example of a licensed Pro.

457
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:15,420
Adam: Well done peaceful. I

458
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:20,160
John: hope I explained that. Yeah, absolutely. Anyway,

459
01:40:20,370 --> 01:41:18,030
Adam: I just thought it was funny. The narcissists were out. That was just funny. They're so competitive. It's so competitive. It's competitive.
Should be Yeah. Well, thank you, Trent. Trent drac, for the artwork for Episode 1240. This is great, because we're one of the only podcasts if not the
only podcast that every single show we release as new album art, it shows up in your podcast players, most of them will show it. And it's exciting
when you see it in an overview and it's this is something about the show, and it's a part of what what, you know what? The package matters, packaging
matters. We learned that from Steve Jobs. We are the iPhone of podcasts, actually. You think about it. A little white box. Yes, that's so no agenda
art. generator.com is where the artists compete. But it's a fun, friendly competition. Everybody has a good time. And we laugh about it. And we love
comic strip blogger. We're just messing with him because he's a blogger. Yeah, he

460
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:18,630
John: deserves it.

461
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:30,450
Adam: You blocked him everywhere. I have to deal with the fallout when you say these things. So stop it. Just stop. No agenda Art generator.com then

462
01:41:30,450 --> 01:41:35,730
John: we have our back is art I used as I probably use more comic strip blogger stuff for the newsletter I know

463
01:41:35,730 --> 01:41:37,800
Adam: and you don't even follow Him, you're a heathen.

464
01:41:42,210 --> 01:41:44,760
John: He's too much of a back channel or from that's certainly

465
01:41:45,180 --> 01:42:15,180
Adam: part of our part of our value for value network here at the no agenda media tribe is the way the system works. Everything you've heard up up to
date, we can give you the the narrative, at least the one we hear we believe or what we're finding out from actual sources, because we're not run by
pharmaceutical companies or by China more by anybody else. For that reason. It's you, the producers. And we love to thank our executive and associate
executive producers as soon as we have quite a few.

466
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:26,850
John: So maybe we should get to it. All right, bingo boom, way more than normal. And I want to thank each and every one of them. And I don't think
it's because of Mother's Day, and maybe because you triggered some thoughts with the V day mentioned. But

467
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:30,900
Adam: I think we should say Happy Mother's Day. And we

468
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:32,100
John: will say Happy Mother's Day

469
01:42:32,370 --> 01:42:34,050
Adam: to all the moms out there. And

470
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:38,940
John: yes, it was surprising because while we're at it, here's what we're really a hallmark holiday by the way

471
01:42:38,970 --> 01:42:56,070
Adam: nobody hears what was surprising is typically we do a Mother's Day promotion. And the joke is that we get five people and said no agenda
producers hate their moms. And so this year, we did nothing like it's Mother's Day. And everyone's like beautiful notes to mom

472
01:42:57,660 --> 01:44:27,720
John: starting with Truman with Kate who gave us $1,000 in $2.42 41 cents on top of that, Utah wait you see an instant it says last week observing all
this to stand here. X's glass shields, polka dots mass oh I see on in marketing t shirts. I thought I have done a hell of a job gratifying this
gamifying this so that's a bonus COVID is the death of truth. No agenda is the opposite of whatever that is one of the very few places where truth
exists. fucka duck thank you for this was done by a randomizer I don't know you for this podcast to YouTube, ying and yang it and it just works. It's
actually Yin. It's not Yang it's Yin. Plus a little help from us third legs that's also zoology. So ology I realized that all these is back to mac and
cheese long for long for simpler days. were no agenda was wins awards with recipes, oatmeal and console wine reviews. I'm doing my donation to a
friend who was angered by Article links being emailed about the COVID hubbub in late March so I sent the no agenda show to her her anger dissipated
and out of the blue she inquired. I think my amygdala is shrinking. Thank you for smacking Chrissy in the mouth. Dame Chrissy will enjoy being
knighted and all the accounting adornment search room and when she shut up slave it's true.

473
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:30,960
Adam: Wait, man, so this is like an instant instant naming naming

474
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:33,270
John: is a woman he hit in a mouse.

475
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:41,820
Adam: It's an instant game. Right. Do you hear me there? Did you hit the mute again? I bet you did.

476
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:42,810
John: I did

477
01:44:42,930 --> 01:44:44,040
Adam: it. Stop doing that.

478
01:44:44,430 --> 01:44:46,200
John: I don't even know how I did it.

suffered a loss recently when may MeV MeV. Kennedy drowned while kayaking. MeV As you may know, was the public health official, a co working for the
US DS Global AIDS program? What about coincidence as one would think? And another note here in the Eurozone, the erosion continues now with the red
judges have Carl soul laying an ID for the ECB stimulus program and the European Court almost instantly replying that the German Constitutional Court
lacks the legal power to judge on the European institutions role, completely ignoring the German Federal Constitution that specifically defines the
role of the Constitution visa v international treaties. They really don't give a crap. One thing is certain The longer the role of crisis lingers, the
better the odds are for EU implosion. Yeah. In the meantime, I'm now wearing a hipster ponytail, as hairdressers just feel shut and I already need to

episode sanks sense. As a staunch libertarian emphasis on the small L. I was overjoyed to find your podcast using the value for value system while I
had donated previously This is my first associate executive producer ship. The show is most certainly the best podcast in the universe. I was further
encouraged by Elon Musk's remark on Rogen about Corona, as he echoed much of what you two have been deconstructing in the past two months. Thanks for
the show notes. They certainly help with grad school. I bet they do. A big Mother's Day shout out to my mama Kim in South Jersey. I love you mom. She
listens regularly. And hopefully this proves that no agenda producers love their mom's dollars that this was for her Dame hood and two cents for the
penny jar.

02:16:33,960 --> 02:17:01,110
John: So that so I got this clip was for the last show, and I just wanted to play it because it's just kind of standalone. And so and I want somebody
in Australia to tell me who this woman is. So she's like a Katie Hopkins of Australia. And so she kind of rails I this is only 31 seconds of something
or went for a couple of minutes because she just kept kept laying into Joe Biden. And she's in Australia, which is I find amusing, but this place is
good. The clip is called fee make.

645
02:17:01,649 --> 02:17:36,539
Unknown: Isn't it just perfect that the party of diversity has gotten rid of every woman and person of color, including the fake Native American
Elizabeth Pocahontas, Warren, and the fake Mexican Beto O'Rourke to end up with two old white millionaire men, one a socialist who had a heart attack
just five months ago. And one is so confused that he has trouble remembering where he is. And why is that Joe Biden is now the front runner to be the
Democratic presidential candidate. Yeah,

646

671
02:19:30,389 --> 02:19:36,659
John: This start with I have the Italy Russia. But I have let's do USA COVID update this about the reopenings.

672
02:19:36,690 --> 02:20:02,520
Unknown: state by state the country is beginning to face the reality of a slow recovery ahead from the covid 19 pandemic. Companies are considering
ways to bring workers back but the unemployment rate is staggering. Whether you are here in New York where there is still a strict lockdown order or
in an area reopening. This is a challenging time. Let's get started with today's top news. Cases of COVID Continue to slow in most of the country.

673
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:03,810
Do you have good after

674
02:20:04,800 --> 02:20:28,380
two months there were more reopenings of barbershops, salons restaurants and public spaces but the rules differ state by state in New York where a
lockdown remains for much of the state Governor Andrew Cuomo said hospitalizations new cases and deaths from the virus dropped again today. But Cuomo
said three children have died from the new syndrome associated with COVID-19. And there are 73 reported cases

675
02:20:28,649 --> 02:20:36,929
it's more inflammation, inflammation of the blood vessels, which can then cause problems with their heart.

676
02:20:37,110 --> 02:21:09,390
Cuomo said parents need to be vigilant while New York health officials work with the CDC to investigate this new syndrome. Nationwide, there have now
been more than 77,000 deaths from COVID-19 and more than 1.2 million confirmed cases. Also today after reports at the Trump administration shelved
guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how to reopen the country. The White House issued a statement from the director of the
CDC Robert Redfield that said the plan quote was in draft form and had not been vetted. Seriously, I'd

677
02:21:09,389 --> 02:21:12,959
Adam: rather have COVID-19 than listen to that report again.

678
02:21:14,399 --> 02:21:16,649
John: That was that was hate hate

679
02:21:16,649 --> 02:21:19,979
Adam: that was bad. That was uninspiring

680
02:21:19,979 --> 02:21:22,439
John: was not as bad as his lighting.

681
02:21:24,180 --> 02:21:25,110
Adam: Was he at home?

682
02:21:25,620 --> 02:21:36,960
John: Yeah, yeah. And he was not only at home but they light him somebody doesn't like him you know, cuz the lighting guys are the guys that can make
it look good or make it look horrible. He looks like Boris Karloff playing Frankenstein.

683
02:21:37,260 --> 02:21:38,190
Adam: Wow. Okay.

684
02:21:38,729 --> 02:21:48,479
John: Harsh. is very harsh, harsh. Okay, let's go to Italy and see what's going on just Italy or COVID Italy and it's also South Korea.

685
02:21:49,229 --> 02:22:13,499
Unknown: In Italy wants to center of the global pandemic the lockdown is starting to ease. Many bars in Rome were open today for takeaway drinks, but
officials warn that social distancing must be maintained to prevent a resurgence and Coronavirus cases. In South Korea. The mayor of Seoul closed more
than 2000 nightclubs just one week after they weren't reopened. Dozens of new Coronavirus cases were connected to people who attended clubs last week.

686
02:22:14,550 --> 02:22:15,060
Hmm.

687
02:22:16,110 --> 02:22:24,630
John: Not much going on there. So that was pretty dull. You're right. Yeah. So let's go and take a look at de-douche is the COVID Russia and comparing
Russia to Bella rousse.

688
02:22:24,840 --> 02:22:45,270
Unknown: Let's look at what's happening internationally. Russia, like most countries has scaled back its celebrations to mark the end of the second
world war in Europe because of the virus pandemic but in neighboring Belarus, one of the only countries yet to impose any social distancing measures
1000s have gathered to mark the 75th anniversary from Moscow skies data magnate has this report.

689
02:22:48,870 --> 02:23:22,890
Even Russia has postponed this year's Victory Day Parade, but it's smaller neighbor to the west Belarus has not despite more than 20,000 COVID cases.
The veterans were encouraged not to come others incentivized to fill seats. good grades promise to students for example, at a time when many in
Belarus don't trust their president on this pandemic. Last summer one of the official counters have 116 deaths. The freshly dug graves at this
cemetery in the small city of stilts we suggest it's far more

690
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:24,210
Adam: miniskirt I believe.

691
02:23:25,200 --> 02:24:00,000
Unknown: This reporter for Russia's channel one was expelled from Belarus and his team stripped of their accreditation after this report, which
suggested that even locals don't believe the numbers. Well, this woman telling him her mother had had COVID but that the official cause of death was
heart failure. The picture inside hospitals even in the Capitol is grim. Every piece of space is used up here. And there's that ubiquitous COVID cough
where the state is failing volunteers are stepping in

692
02:24:00,870 --> 02:24:06,390
Adam: the ubiquitous COVID cough has that been identified as a specific type of cough?

693
02:24:06,630 --> 02:24:14,490
John: Yeah, well that's what JC when he had he had COVID and he survived it easy enough. But he ended up with a COVID

694
02:24:14,490 --> 02:24:16,410
Adam: called the cotton that lasts a while.

695
02:24:17,460 --> 02:24:42,090
John: It didn't last as long you know how you get sometimes you get too cold or somebody gets into this just coughed it never goes away. And last and
last and last. You know people had I think Horowitz had it for like three four shows. I like a month he had this cough just terrible cough. The COVID
cough which is really horrible to hear it. It's like it's horrible to hear it. I mean, it's just a cringe. It didn't last long at all. Which is good.

696
02:24:43,469 --> 02:24:49,079
Adam: No, that is good. That is good. Let me see if we can find it. An example of this COVID car

697
02:24:49,110 --> 02:24:53,820
John: It sounds like it sounds like somebody's coffee and then you hear a goose honking

698
02:24:54,510 --> 02:25:15,540
Adam: let's see like a do so here we here we have a couple of examples. The This is Does this sound like you on YouTube? That may be exactly what
we're looking for? Let's see. Why don't I hear anything? That it? No, no, no, that's you're failing

699
02:25:15,809 --> 02:25:22,199
John: into a higher gear. There's a very specific thing it does. It is like really frightening to hear it. The COVID Golf.

700
02:25:22,440 --> 02:26:39,840
Adam: Yes. I got an email which may fit into a good topic for us today. And I and I want to reiterate that this show john, I come to each show, we
don't talk to each other in between shows rarely, maybe an email or something. Typically Johnson me some chick on YouTube. Hey, guys, whatever. That's
usually what I get from john. So we show up and I have my stuff. He has his stuff, and I received an email that I wanted to respond to, I thought that
it would be appropriate, I see that you've got some clips to talk about it. This is from Roland. He's from Germany, German producer. In the morning,
gents, I'm not sure how voting works. But in Germany, it's like this, you get a postcard with your name on it. The city knows where you live is you
have to register when you move to it tells you when and where you can go and vote. Historically, it's been on Sundays between eight and 6pm 8am 6pm.
If you're out of town, you can't make it to the voting place. Usually a school or kindergarten in your neighborhood can send you the postcard back at
no charge. And you can ask for vote by mail papers, which you then get and send back in time done. Well, now this apparently isn't much of a thing in
the US. What is wrong? What is the problem? Why you also jacked up about it? Some analysis would be helpful, especially to the international
listeners. I think that's an appropriate question, Roland.

701
02:26:40,770 --> 02:27:02,100
John: Well, I have two clips on this bingo boom. First of all, you can vote by mail and some some states. In fact, that's all you do. You don't even
there's not even this processor, you're talking about Washington State, for example, is a 100% vote by mail. There's a lot of people that believe that
it invites fraud. And allow

702
02:27:02,100 --> 02:28:04,590
Adam: me to explain that as I understand the fraud part of it in the United States, and this is why it's an issue. We I I hate to say it but our
voting public is pretty dumb. So when someone knocks on your door and says, Hey, did you get your mailing voting Bally's? I don't know, man, it's
running or somewhere? Well, listen, why don't you just, you know, just, I'll take care of it. I'll hand it in just what do you want to be democrat?
Right? Okay, we'll just write this down. And I'll mail it for you don't have to worry about it. It's called harvesting. And sometimes we'll get
ballots that are just empty in the affiliate in for them. It's, it is and this is, I think it was Orange County or Calabasas somewhere in in
California where they they followed these people and showed how they do it. And this is not just the US but it but this is harvesting is a real issue.
And also, I think it's just a lame as a citizen, you go into the booth and you kick the lever. And you go there you stand in line with everybody
grousing about it. It's part

703
02:28:04,590 --> 02:28:07,140
John: of the ID by the way. Well,

704
02:28:07,140 --> 02:28:11,940
Adam: no, no, that's a different Well, in Texas, heaven forbid, yeah, Texas, you have to show your ID.

705
02:28:13,469 --> 02:28:59,879
John: Well, here's a question. Here's an example of this is what you have to deal with. This is on PBS again. And they're having this this problem in
Connecticut because Connecticut, you can do an absentee ballot, but it's a very complicated process. And the problem with Connecticut is what the
story is about mostly is that they the Connecticut constitution says you have to show up. Yes. So it's not like Washington State is like is designing
the systems designed for vote vote by mail. And by the way, it's funny how the harvesters do such a good job. They tend to get a state loaded with
Democrats and I can just accuse the democrats but when you hear reports like this, here's the vote by mail fraud question that was asked on the PBS.
Among some people that are discussing how to do this in Connecticut.

706
02:28:59,910 --> 02:29:37,350
Unknown: We just six months until November's presidential election states across the country are trying to determine how they will safely collect and
count ballots during a national health emergency. For many states, that means reevaluating in person versus absentee voting. Just yesterday,
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that the entire state would be asked to vote by mail and the November election. But for states like
Connecticut with a long history of in person voting, the push to vote by mail remains a complicated task. NewsHour weekend's Christopher Booker has
more. The scenes for Wisconsin's recent election did not sit well with Connecticut Secretary of State Denise Merrill.

707
02:29:37,410 --> 02:29:49,200
That was a turning point in my discussions with both the legislative leadership and the governor. Nobody wants to look like Milwaukee, frankly, and
that that can happen pretty easily

708
02:29:49,260 --> 02:30:09,780
after democratic governor Tony Evers executive order that delayed the state's election by two months was overturned by the Supreme Court. Wisconsin
voters had to go to polling places if they wanted to cast a ballot. 52 people who worked the polls, or voted on April 7 have tested positive for
COVID-19. A situation Meryl does not want to duplicate in her state.

709
02:30:09,990 --> 02:30:28,290
You know, people are just waking up to the fact that they may be asked to go either in a primary or particularly in the general election is their
concern and jeopardize their health. And I think the Milwaukee situation really galvanized people because it was all over television. And people were
home watching it,

710
02:30:28,350 --> 02:30:42,930
but hoping to minimize in person voting in Connecticut will not be an easy task with voting laws dating back to the state's 1818 constitution. The
rules to vote absentee or by mail in the state, nicknamed the constitution state are restrictive.

711
02:30:44,219 --> 02:30:46,109
Adam: Yeah, that's a that's a decent overview.

712
02:30:46,770 --> 02:30:55,830
John: Well, that's a decent already. That was the wrong clip. But when you told me to play, vote by mail fraud question. Oh,

713
02:30:55,830 --> 02:30:56,730
Adam: it was the wrong clip.

714
02:30:57,569 --> 02:31:04,349
John: But that's a better clip for the intro to this clip I wouldn't have I should have actually played that clip first. So you accidentally did the
right thing.

715
02:31:04,559 --> 02:31:25,619
Unknown: voter fraud is a major talking point for those against expanding vote by mail. On April 8, President Trump tweeted that Republicans should
fight very hard when it comes to statewide mail and voting. Democrats are clamoring for it tremendous potential for voter fraud. And for whatever
reason, doesn't work out well, for Republicans. voter fraud comes up quite often. Have you seen rampant voter

716
02:31:25,620 --> 02:31:26,730
fraud in Connecticut?

717
02:31:27,870 --> 02:31:29,130
John: Oh, absolutely not.

718
02:31:29,129 --> 02:32:03,389
Unknown: I mean, for people to complain about absentee ballot fraud in Connecticut is really kind of ridiculous. Because we have so many processes in
place. First, you have to mail the application to people, they have to fill it out, mail it back to the clerk, the clerk then mails the ballot to the
person which is in a double envelope, you have to put it in an inside envelope and then in an outside envelope to protect their anonymity. And then
you mail it back to the clerk. And during all this process. The clerk has to note every step of the way. In our electronic voter registry. Secretary

719
02:32:03,390 --> 02:32:11,670
Merrill says there's little evidence that there is widespread voter fraud in Connecticut, can you point to specific instances of voter fraud in
Connecticut?

720
02:32:12,330 --> 02:32:23,790
I don't have them on me. But we deal with these every year, we end up having a lot of kind of quirky election issues that I don't particularly find
coincidental, but it's something we need to address.

721
02:32:23,820 --> 02:32:24,690
The critics have

722
02:32:24,720 --> 02:32:33,210
expanded vote by mail often cite voter fraud. Is there evidence that when you increase the access to vote by mail,

723
02:32:33,420 --> 02:32:34,800
fraud increases?

724
02:32:35,069 --> 02:32:35,429
No.

725
02:32:35,610 --> 02:32:35,940
None.

726
02:32:35,970 --> 02:32:36,780
There's no evidence

727
02:32:38,130 --> 02:32:41,280
whatsoever. Nowhere it does not exist. Oh,

728
02:32:41,580 --> 02:32:43,080
Adam: I'm poorly informed then.

729
02:32:43,980 --> 02:32:45,720
John: Yeah, you're you don't know what you're talking about.

730
02:32:45,720 --> 02:32:46,590
Adam: You need to shut up.

731
02:32:46,980 --> 02:33:41,250
John: Because she said right there, that democrat woman. But she said no, no, never happened. never happens. It never happens. I know what you're
talking about. Just because you go you walk into the good like, for example, here at the house. I walk into a mailman and there's there's two or three
ballots sitting there. I could pick any with any one of them up, type a bunch of stuff. I put stuff on there, sign somebody's phony name, send it in.
I could do that anyone could do it. Oh, somebody they lose some mail. somebody steals it from a post office box. I mean, that's just minor. But the
harvest thing which you pointed out, which has always been the the big threat. And the joke of it is the democrats always hated much of this because
it would be? Well, I mean, the republicans used to hate this for the reasons that the democrats used to like it, which is in the deep south back in
the 50s. And 60s, they would just democrats would steal all the black votes just rouse

732
02:33:41,250 --> 02:33:42,150
Adam: the black vote.

733
02:33:42,960 --> 02:33:52,800
John: They just steal them they steal the black vote, or they buy a vote. They say you there's another way of doing it. We're harvesting you go up to
everybody you go door to door. So I'll give you five bucks for your ballot.

734
02:33:52,800 --> 02:33:54,810
Adam: Is that illegal? I think it's fine.

735
02:33:54,990 --> 02:33:55,830
John: It's illegal,

736
02:33:55,860 --> 02:33:56,460
Adam: is it?

737
02:33:57,270 --> 02:34:01,560
John: Yeah. It's illegal. It's illegal.

738
02:34:01,620 --> 02:34:05,850
Adam: Is it illegal to say to someone here's five bucks write down your vote right now?

739
02:34:07,110 --> 02:34:09,420
John: That's not illegal. Well, probably not.

740
02:34:09,450 --> 02:34:13,380
Adam: Isn't that exactly what politics is? I'm going to give you this for your vote. Isn't that?

741
02:34:14,100 --> 02:34:18,210
John: Maybe we should it's, it's, it's asking for trouble. Go. Well,

742
02:34:18,539 --> 02:34:19,229
Adam: there's that.

743
02:34:20,850 --> 02:34:25,410
John: But this woman when I heard that clip, were at the very end of that clip. She goes, Oh,

744
02:34:25,530 --> 02:34:27,000
Unknown: no.

745
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:30,450
John: Then I know something's up.

746
02:34:32,790 --> 02:34:39,150
Adam: How do we usually put that somewhere? We had a thing about that. We could see Oh, yeah. That's not it. Where is it?

747
02:34:40,290 --> 02:34:41,160
John: Ah,

748
02:34:42,510 --> 02:34:52,890
Adam: we had nothing to see here. I've lost so many jobs. I'm losing my touch. You are the eyeball. Nothing. It's not completely healed. I'll give you
that. But it's not that bad.

749
02:34:52,889 --> 02:34:55,439
Unknown: Don't look over here. Nothing to see.

750
02:34:56,700 --> 02:35:03,180
Adam: There we go. But for a long time. I couldn't find it. It's been replaced by

751
02:35:05,100 --> 02:35:05,700
Unknown: what happens

752
02:35:06,719 --> 02:35:07,349
John: orange.

753
02:35:08,010 --> 02:35:31,320
Adam: So what is taking place now is we have this political fight, which Trump is CIA's tweeting about a lot so I guess he's worried is this you know,
the house is looking to make legislation is that I guess you can do it by state even to vote by mail, because oh Coronavirus be too dangerous for
people to show up and vote.

754
02:35:31,559 --> 02:35:41,999
John: And it's lame. Is it too dangerous for them to show up at the grocery store and stand in line? Is it too dangerous to go to the hair cutter? I
mean, why is this more dangerous than these other things that people do constantly?

755
02:35:42,210 --> 02:36:11,190
Adam: If there's a shop that says hair cutter, I'm not going that's a dangerous shop. It says coughs that's a different story. So there is a lot going
on in the political In fact, pretty much all of it is now political. And I have been enjoying these transcripts from the Is it the House Intelligence
Oversight Committee, these 5053 transcripts that have been released?

756
02:36:12,180 --> 02:36:19,350
John: I have a clip. Can I just tell you which one our friend Kaylee? Yeah. slamming him Yummy.

757
02:36:21,300 --> 02:36:24,570
Adam: Yummy, yummy. Oh, no,

758
02:36:24,569 --> 02:36:28,979
John: I reading from these transcripts and saying, Well, how grainy was that they were released.

759
02:36:29,010 --> 02:36:47,640
Adam: Now let's just go over this. Before we play. Before we say calian you meesh now has Flynn been exonerated? Or is that just Barr saying it has to
happen the judge hasn't done it yet. He's he actually forced exonerated exonerate dropped all charges.

760
02:36:47,790 --> 02:37:00,150
John: Well, that case it's not No, no, I take it back. You gotta use this right? Because you'll get jumped on by all of these guys that are going to
write your note. It's not exoneration when the case is dropped? Was it cases dismissed, rights dismissed.

761
02:37:00,569 --> 02:37:13,109
Adam: And what is interesting about the dismissal is that it comes from now overwhelming evidence from the FBI is on files that they were railroading,
Flynn.

762
02:37:13,740 --> 02:37:14,400
John: Yeah, it was

763
02:37:14,399 --> 02:37:20,639
Adam: really railroading him like like, like massholes like real thugs. Really not okay stuff.

764
02:37:20,819 --> 02:37:35,459
John: But then he did a fat it's one of these old Russian things like Barry I used to do you know, he said, Show me a man, I'll find you a crime,
right? In addition to the burial Stalinist stick ideas, a way to do it. And that's what they were doing. And it was, but Obama was behind it. Well,

765
02:37:35,460 --> 02:39:15,840
Adam: this is what's interesting. So now we have in, in this case, all of a sudden, we have 53, transcripts, declassified of all of these players, and
this is the hours and hours and hours of testimony. It's very interesting to read. I was interested in Brad parscale, the guy who's, who is now the
campaign manager, for 2020. The guy was just a web dude in Texas, in San Antonio, who did you know, like the wineries did a one pager website for
Yvonne cuz thing, whatever. And you just and they said, well, we're gonna explain 2015 exploratory throw up a page for candidate Trump, see how it
looks. And it just grew from there. And the guy just turned out to be really smart. He's never done any political campaigns, anything like that. And
he just used cars. In fact, he did everything that the political consultants in Washington DC that they advise, he did the opposite. He did all kinds
of different innovative things. And it's really interesting to read his story. Now, there's not much in the way I mean, every five or so, while you
were selecting vendors for the website, did any of them possibly have ties to Russia? I'm not kidding. Every question is like that. So did they did
they speak with an accent? I mean, this is the kind of stuff that was going on. And this has worried a lot of people. And the main, here's what's
interesting, if Flynn The case is dropped, and his his, you know, what he was accused of was lying to the FBI. And now it turns out, he was lying to

766
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:55,950
the FBI because the FBI said you better lie, or we're gonna lock your kid up. And the lie was a very minute detail of a phone conversation he had had
with the Russian ambassador Kislyak and the feds and when they were interviewing, which I believe include Peter struck, they had already heard the
call, they knew the answers to the questions they were asking. And of course, he answered something wrong or did I don't remember that or I didn't
have this time. And then they said, well, you're gonna have to plead guilty here. Otherwise, we're going to get your kid and he has a kid on the way
and it was it's really ugly. Really. It's like J. Edgar, Edgar Hoover, typestyle ugly and

767
02:39:57,660 --> 02:39:58,500
Unknown: the

768
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:23,250
Adam: President Obama, all of a sudden has some coincidentally leaked audio that comes out. In fact, I have a little news report about it. Because I
think what's happening, I believe, Obama, as you pointed out, Obama is implicated in this thing. It goes all the way up to him. And he's striking back
but interesting while he's doing it.

769
02:40:24,149 --> 02:40:50,309
Unknown: Former President Obama discussed the Michael Flynn case during a phone call with some former Obama administration officials. And then
portions of the audio of that call were leaked to Yahoo News. Flynn, you may remember pled guilty to lying to the FBI about his communications with
the Russian ambassador. The Justice Department announced Thursday it plans to drop the case against the former national security adviser. Obama says
he was shocked by the move. That's the kind of stuff

770
02:40:51,059 --> 02:40:52,679
where you you begin to

771
02:40:54,660 --> 02:40:55,290
get worried.

772
02:40:56,130 --> 02:40:59,160
Basic, not just institutional norms, but

773
02:41:00,450 --> 02:41:03,300
our basic understanding of rule of law.

774
02:41:05,160 --> 02:41:05,850
is is

775
02:41:07,649 --> 02:41:09,749
is is a risk.

776
02:41:09,990 --> 02:41:25,080
President Trump praised the Justice Department's decision. He also praised Flynn calling him an innocent man. The White House says it believes the FBI
was trying to target and trap Flynn over his comments. Not surprisingly, reaction up on Capitol Hill has been split how

777
02:41:25,380 --> 02:41:38,010
Adam: I don't like this report. I think it's full of crap. They also left stuff out. Here's the actual leaked call. And there's something that Obama
said here, which is factually incorrect. And I'm waiting for the news media to let us know about that.

778
02:41:38,490 --> 02:41:53,910
Unknown: The news over the last 24 hours, I think has been somewhat downplayed about the Justice Department dropping charges against Michael Flynn.
And the fact that there is

779
02:41:53,910 --> 02:41:57,360
no precedent that anybody can find for

780
02:41:58,889 --> 02:42:00,659
someone who's been charged with perjury.

781
02:42:02,430 --> 02:42:04,140
Just getting off

782
02:42:04,139 --> 02:42:06,749
John: scot free. Interestingly,

783
02:42:07,320 --> 02:42:12,510
Adam: he wasn't charged with perjury. That's just not true.

784
02:42:12,990 --> 02:42:16,200
John: No, he didn't take an oath. perjury is very specific.

785
02:42:16,319 --> 02:42:31,139
Adam: So why did Obama say that? Why is he making a big deal out of well, this has never happened before a guy perjured himself and he was like, No, I
think Obama's a little a little were a little frayed skin a little hot under the feets.

786
02:42:32,250 --> 02:42:44,490
John: Yeah, did sound Do you think maybe Obama knew this was being recorded? Absolutely. And it was it was another piece of disinformation get thrown
to the pot is perjury. Nonsense. Totally. Anyway, picks it up

787
02:42:44,490 --> 02:42:52,590
Adam: and see if it's even flies. Yeah. Interesting. Well, that shows he's very when Obama has to step in and do this kind of crap. He's worried.

788
02:42:55,649 --> 02:43:37,469
John: Yeah, or something. That's very strange. Well, I do have the super clips. Well, what this was, this is about Flynn. And this is a bunch of clips
that came right after Flynn was first arrested, indicted, whatever they want to call it, the advertising. And all the media was banned. And and Trump
knew this was the setup. He bitched about he's a flinch and have been arrested. He's a great patriot, and on and on, and the White House and and the,
the right, the conservatives all knew something was fishy about this whole thing. And meanwhile, MSNBC and CNN and all the rest of the news media,
they had their thoughts about it, and they were mocking everybody.

789
02:43:37,500 --> 02:43:45,930
Unknown: President Trump and his top aides have been routinely ignoring the truth and pushing phony conspiracy theories.

790
02:43:45,960 --> 02:43:55,440
The President, it seems to be saying that this was a case of entrapment that Michael Flynn was essentially pressured into line. What is your response?
I

791
02:43:55,440 --> 02:43:56,670
think that's hogwash.

792
02:43:56,700 --> 02:44:00,990
You know, there are all kinds of conspiracy theories about how he was entrapped.

793
02:44:01,020 --> 02:44:07,680
The FBI agents didn't do anything wrong here. So I think that's important because there are a lot of sort of conspiracy theories. They

794
02:44:07,680 --> 02:44:13,320
Adam: all work together and you know, the fox news, people in the White House fuel these sorts of rumors, do they

795
02:44:13,319 --> 02:44:34,049
Unknown: send these around with fax machines? They come up with these conspiracy theories and they send around fax machines, they should just knock it
off and realize that they're ridiculous conspiracy theories are going to be knocked down, stop stop with the conspiracy theories. So I think that loud
sound you heard it about 1230. Eastern was the sound of 10,000 conspiracy theories by the Trump defenders exploding

796
02:44:34,080 --> 02:44:38,070
the sound you hear is a million conspiracy theories exploding.

797
02:44:38,700 --> 02:44:41,400
The trumpets all over the country. Their heads were blown up.

798
02:44:41,460 --> 02:44:42,090
Oh,

799
02:44:42,120 --> 02:44:52,050
here's another conspiracy theory that has been blown to bits Trump talking points and right wing media conspiracies demolished for Michael Flynn. He
was

800
02:44:52,050 --> 02:44:54,660
duped. It's so embarrassing to

801
02:44:55,229 --> 02:44:56,249
watch all your chips

802
02:44:56,250 --> 02:44:58,890
in the middle of the table. Better be damn sure you got a good hand.

803
02:44:58,950 --> 02:45:04,680
The FBI broke standard protocol in the way that they came in and ambush Gen flan.

804
02:45:05,550 --> 02:45:06,420

much ground the mainstream. Just people don't care. That's why people are out and about. They're not listening to your fear anymore. They're done with
you.

807
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:31,620
John: There's a lot of people that are shitting in there.

808
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:35,850

Adam: Right and then of course no agenda meetup calm will start moving again. I did want to mention Sir scatman of Norristown, Pennsylvania has put

03:12:44,040 --> 03:12:52,260
John: So I have two things gone while What? I have two things left. Okay. I have the Kaylee slamming him each.

914
03:12:52,290 --> 03:12:54,990
Adam: Oh, yes. Yeah, I was kind of excited about that. Yeah, we should

915
03:12:54,990 --> 03:13:12,240
John: we do that now. And then last but not least to that last. It's not as good as your other slams in the past, but it's just a similar style. And
I'm liking the way she's doing these things. A lot of people like her. Then I got the debate and came out it looks like it came out of the basement.

916
03:13:12,389 --> 03:13:14,549
Adam: Oh, okay. This is good news.

917
03:13:14,549 --> 03:13:19,079
John: He did they did a special special. I don't know what a meetup personal Wait, was

918
03:13:19,080 --> 03:13:22,920
Adam: this? Was this yet another technological abortion?

919
03:13:23,549 --> 03:13:24,899
John: No, it was actually pretty good.

920
03:13:24,959 --> 03:13:26,879
Adam: I heard that he had a really bad one

921
03:13:26,910 --> 03:13:32,370
John: didn't do it. Well, and it was like Joe Biden live and he liked to live was like in quotes. It was like, you know,

922
03:13:33,330 --> 03:13:34,320
Unknown: he's like

923
03:13:35,430 --> 03:14:07,020
John: so so he's in the he comes out with the with a stupid mass gun looks like an idiot. And I think he's in his back in his in his basement with a
gun. I don't think he's does a bookshelf she i think is a green screen. I think they just changed the set. You have him standing. That's what I think.
I don't think he was because I don't know that he's got this background. And then if you listen carefully, I'm going to play two clips. This is the
first one is a bit of Biden. You play that? Has so here. Oops. Being here is pacing. Oh, here we go.

924
03:14:07,590 --> 03:14:24,360
Unknown: It has so far cost 10s of 1000s of Americans life and millions of jobs. And make no mistake. It doesn't matter how much the market rebounds.
As long as there are millions of unemployed struggling people to get by. We won't be anywhere near bouncing back.

925
03:14:30,209 --> 03:14:32,939
Adam: That sounds really dumb. We Yeah.

926
03:14:33,299 --> 03:14:35,939
John: As long as millions of people struggling to get by.

927
03:14:35,969 --> 03:14:37,679
Adam: It's great. That's basically what he's saying.

928
03:14:37,830 --> 03:14:45,060
Unknown: As long as there are millions of unemployed struggling people to get by. We won't be anywhere near bouncing back. Yeah.

929
03:14:47,100 --> 03:14:49,980
Adam: What he meant was people struggling to get by but okay.

930
03:14:50,520 --> 03:15:22,890
Unknown: Second, his entire economic strategy is focused on helping the wealthy and big corporations. Just imagine, just imagine what we could be
doing now. With the $2 trillion in tax cuts, Trump delivered to his rich friends as his first priority. Imagine how much better position we be in
right now. If instead of Donald Trump cheering corporations on, they spent hundreds of billions of dollars buying back their own stock, cheese
corporations have been using that money to keep workers on their payroll. Okay.

931
03:15:22,920 --> 03:15:34,260
Adam: All right. This is this is insulting to my intelligence. The Democrat Party, who were the republicans voted unanimously for this bill for the
cares Act,

932
03:15:34,559 --> 03:15:36,389
John: which is not about the cares act.

933
03:15:36,420 --> 03:15:37,560
Adam: What are you talking about? Then?

934
03:15:37,590 --> 03:15:41,280
John: He's talking about that tax cut that went into play in 2017.

935
03:15:41,940 --> 03:15:42,810
Adam: The $2 trillion.

936
03:15:43,799 --> 03:15:46,349
John: Well, he's got his numbers a little mixed up.

937
03:15:47,370 --> 03:15:50,610
Adam: Because that's not what it was. He does have his numbers a little mixed up.

938
03:15:50,700 --> 03:16:01,740
John: Well, anyway, he goes on this next part of it, but they did produce us a little bit because they have and I noticed this in the first clip, too,
but notice it more. I heard birds in the

939
03:16:01,740 --> 03:16:02,250
Adam: background.

940
03:16:02,280 --> 03:16:06,990
John: That's what I'm saying. They got phony birds chirping in the background.

941
03:16:07,020 --> 03:16:09,090
Adam: This is on the brown the green is no

942
03:16:09,090 --> 03:16:12,300
John: way you'd have to make the birds Come on.

943
03:16:13,440 --> 03:16:22,170
Adam: Hey, wait a minute. You should that Windows not open. It could be real birds. Joe Biden can't even record Joe Biden property, let alone some
birds in the background. But

944
03:16:22,170 --> 03:16:29,730
John: it could be. Yeah, sure. Okay, play now. He really goes after Trump. Everything's Trump's fault. Of course,

945
03:16:29,729 --> 03:16:31,349
Adam: it is. While he has blood on his hands.

946
03:16:31,379 --> 03:18:03,149
Unknown: No. COVID-19 caused massive economic challenges. But this crisis hit harder and will last longer because Donald Trump spent the last three
years undermining the core pillars of our economic strength. Many small businesses closed, because stay at home or because of stay at home orders. But
a lot of them won't open again, because they don't have a cushion. Two to three years of Trump's policies that rewarded the biggest companies. Yes,
many have lost their jobs because of the crisis. Or we're seeing many proud families forced to endure epic lines for food boxes in football stadium
parking lots, because Donald Trump has spent three years tilting the playing field toward the wealthy and not the middle class. No, Trump loves to
crow about the great economy he built when the crisis hit became clear who the economy had built was built to serve not workers, not the middle class,
not families. Trump's economic agenda has three unmistakable failings, failings that have been present since day one, but are coming into sharp relief
in the current crisis. First, Donald Trump's main measure, his main measure of economic progress is the state of the stock market. It's the only
metric he values and it's the only lens through which he sees our economy. For the past three years, even as Americans have had to work harder than
ever to pay their bills. He said the economy was great, because the stock market was up. Dead. This

947
03:18:03,149 --> 03:18:27,779
Adam: is pretty insulting. It really is. Yeah, I do. But I heard a different bird when I listened to Joe Biden. This is the bird I hear it it's Gosh,
man, instead of saying, here's what I'm going to do. No, this is all he's got. So the he has nothing.

948
03:18:28,590 --> 03:18:54,450
John: He's got nothing. You can't just you already seen this before. You can't just run on I hate Trump know that hit? That's probably why Hillary
lost. Exactly. Above all other things. I mean, she could have won easily but just kaanchi had no no plans. It was just oh, this guy sucks. Yeah, this
guy sucks. Vote for me. What do you guys What are you offering? I don't care because this guy sucks till you vote for me and then we'll get rid of
him. Exactly.

949
03:18:54,509 --> 03:18:57,119
Adam: That's exactly right. It's exactly what's happening here.

950
03:18:57,180 --> 03:19:09,240
John: nothing going on. And then last on my list of clips. I do have Kaylee and she's going back and forth. As you meet she brings in some of these
quotes that were from the release papers and she was thinking is great. I'm sure she's gonna have more now.

951
03:19:09,750 --> 03:19:24,600
Adam: This is Kaylee McInerney, who is the new girl on the block. She is putting up quite a fight against against the Washington press corps. I am
surprised I thought she wouldn't last a week but she's there and she's hanging in.

952
03:19:24,629 --> 03:19:27,869
John: She's a tough book made up cookie. It's impressive.

953
03:19:30,090 --> 03:19:31,800
Unknown: In 2015, shortly after

954
03:19:31,799 --> 03:19:35,219
John: the president said at some Mexican immigrants were rapists and criminals. You

955
03:19:35,220 --> 03:19:40,830
Unknown: said that that language was racist and hateful? Do you still believe that? Well, I'm

956
03:19:40,829 --> 03:19:44,099
actually glad you asked that because for about the first

957
03:19:44,100 --> 03:19:52,830
four weeks of the election, I was watching CNN and I was naively believing some of the headlines that I saw. And

958
03:19:56,280 --> 03:19:57,000
I'm actually not

959
03:19:57,000 --> 03:21:11,520
going to read the headlines. So I very quickly came around supported the president of vaccine and hired me, I was a many eight on one panels where I
proudly supported this president who I believe is one of the best presidents if not the best president this country will ever have. But I would
encourage the individual who did that analysis of my past, rather than focusing on me, he really should be focused on some of the very guests cnn
shows tab on their network he should be focused on. I mean, my over here, Jim's Jim Clapper, who said, you know, 10 days before he privately told
investigators there is no evidence of collusion, that Watergate pales in comparison to the Russia probe, I'd encourage them to look at Samantha
powers, who is privately saying I'm not in possession of any evidence of collusion, Ambassador Rice, I don't recall, intelligence or evidence of any
collusion, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, I do not recall that being briefed to me. And for three years, two years, probably more than that.
CNN ran with the collusion narrative. And if the American people are watching right now, they're probably very confused as to some of the quotes I
read, because those individuals were saying much different things publicly than they were saying privately. And I'm very grateful that those
transcripts were released yesterday, and perhaps the K file should do an analysis of that.

960
03:21:12,479 --> 03:21:14,249
Are you walking back those comments today?

961
03:21:16,709 --> 03:21:22,049
This president there is no questioning that so honored to work for him and evany Next question,

962
03:21:22,049 --> 03:21:22,559
thank you.

963
03:21:25,020 --> 03:21:36,090
Adam: Ooh, shocking. I tell you well, you me she's got to start doing some damn error reporting. Is she only interested in making Kaley look stupid?
Is that what they're doing? What a waste of time?

964
03:21:36,389 --> 03:22:04,859
John: They're not getting very far. It's like a half times Mart mean girl does that wouldn't touch her. She's probably not to be shocked. Probably one
of those women. You just don't do that too. And I want to mention she did get a little zinger in there. Which was what she said. I was hired by CNN.
On Windows. Yes. eight to one panels. Which means there's eight people eight Democrats. It's

965
03:22:04,860 --> 03:22:07,230
Adam: a one rip Right. Exactly. Exactly.

966
03:22:08,670 --> 03:22:09,690
John: All right, everybody.

Brexit was Brexit.

981

The UK is set to formally leave the European Union. The government will now focus on the next phase of negotiations getting a trade deal and forging a
new partnership with the remaining 27 countries.

982
03:25:52,350 --> 03:25:53,850
There are three cases

983
03:25:53,850 --> 03:26:07,740
of patients with Coronavirus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has now been discharged from hospital as he continues his recovery from COVID-19.

984
03:26:09,750 --> 03:26:12,450
Increasingly, families are going public with what

A deadly and contagious virus from China has made its way into the US.

992
03:26:38,639 --> 03:26:42,209
But specifically the trans community who may have been on schedule for

994
03:26:42,750 --> 03:26:45,930
John: some of them may be affected directly by COVID-19.

995
03:26:46,920 --> 03:26:54,690
Unknown: That's all folks. I didn't

996
03:26:56,160 --> 03:26:56,850
I didn't.

997
03:26:58,380 --> 03:27:00,570
I didn't. Here we go. We go. We

998
03:27:01,979 --> 03:27:02,729
sit down.

999
03:27:02,819 --> 03:27:03,389
We go.

1000
03:27:03,419 --> 03:27:06,299
Thank you, Mr. President. That's enough. Here we go. Thank you,

1001
03:27:06,299 --> 03:27:07,139
Mr. President.

1002
03:27:07,860 --> 03:27:13,470
That's enough. We stopped him cold. There we go. I'm not gonna say anything.

1003
03:27:14,069 --> 03:27:15,659
Hillary Clinton is a bigot.

1004
03:27:17,129 --> 03:27:26,549
We shouldn't treat people that way. very weak on crime. That's one of the things I think about, hey, look, this is gonna have a huge impact on China.
So what's that

1005
03:27:26,549 --> 03:27:27,149
all about?

1006
03:27:27,539 --> 03:27:28,289
But here's the thing.

1007
03:27:28,709 --> 03:27:33,209
John: I didn't call you. I didn't call you. I didn't call me directly and I'll call

1008
03:27:33,209 --> 03:27:34,379
Unknown: somebody and give them hell.

1009
03:27:34,950 --> 03:27:38,550
Let's do it the way you want. Let's do it the way you want.

1010
03:27:41,010 --> 03:27:58,230
And we're doing well. And now we're doing better. Nobody has to tell me to do it. I've been talking about that for years. I never told you about
spaceforce Well, it's an incredible thing. It's really like trying to put out a fire. You know, long it took me to make that decision. There's no
collusion. There was no

1011
03:27:58,229 --> 03:27:59,009
collusion.

1012
03:27:59,430 --> 03:28:03,030
I want security Peter. There we go. It's a

1013
03:28:03,360 --> 03:28:04,170
John: disaster.

1014
03:28:04,290 --> 03:28:12,840
Unknown: They don't know what the hell they're doing. Here we go. angry people. It should. I've done a lot. I don't want to do it in China.

1015
03:28:20,670 --> 03:28:24,870

1016
03:28:26,340 --> 03:28:27,030
John: Wrong
