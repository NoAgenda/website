a"},{"timestamp":2446,"text":"whistleblower but then we were told you"},{"timestamp":2448,"text":"were not representing"},{"timestamp":2449,"text":"the government but yourself the hearing"},{"timestamp":2452,"text":"title suggests the hearings about"},{"timestamp":2453,"text":"protecting scientific integrity"},{"timestamp":2455,"text":"yet the chair invited a witness who will"},{"timestamp":2457,"text":"not be speaking to that issue"},{"timestamp":2459,"text":"so it's all pretty confusing and unusual"},{"timestamp":2461,"text":"to say the least"},{"timestamp":2463,"text":"here we are in the middle of a pandemic"},{"timestamp":2465,"text":"and we aren't given time to secure our"},{"timestamp":2467,"text":"witnesses conduct appropriate

the joke is he"},{"timestamp":2491,"text":"didn't do a very good job of any of it"},{"timestamp":2493,"text":"except that one clear one you played"},{"timestamp":2494,"text":"which is pretty much what everyone"},{"timestamp":2496,"text":"played "},{"timestamp":2498,"text":"so that was a i consider the whole thing"},{"timestamp":2500,"text":"an epic fail"},{"timestamp":2501,"text":"well i was being honest about it yeah"},{"timestamp":2503,"text":"but going back like"},{"timestamp":2505,"text":"the push now and that's really wanting"},{"timestamp":2506,"text":"to want to prove with that clip"},{"timestamp":2508,"text":"the push is for uh"},{"timestamp":2512,"text":"truth science is truth that's the push"},{"timestamp":2515,"text":"and that's"},{"timestamp":2516,"text":"and let the scientists leave we kind of"},{"timestamp":2517,"text":"heard that but now he's"},{"timestamp":2519,"text":"this this guy he's the pied piper and"},{"timestamp":2521,"text":"he's supposed to say the things"},{"timestamp":2523,"text":"everyone's going to repeat and you'll"},{"timestamp":2524,"text":"hear "},{"timestamp":2524,"text":"well as dr bright said you know you're"},{"timestamp":2526,"text":"going to hear that i don't think so"},{"timestamp":2529,"text":"so we had the big uh rhona special on"},{"timestamp":2532,"text":"cnn with anderson pooper"},{"timestamp":2534,"text":"and sanjay gupta and there she is the"},{"timestamp":2537,"text":"expert when it comes to science all"},{"timestamp":2539,"text":"things science the"},{"timestamp":2541,"text":"uh ever so idealistic gratitude"},{"timestamp":2544,"text":"i've seen you talk about online too is"},{"timestamp":2546,"text":"just how important it is to"},{"timestamp":2548,"text":"listen to experts and listen to science"},{"timestamp":2551,"text":"and this is a time"},{"timestamp":2552,"text":"when you know i was not a very good"},{"timestamp":2553,"text":"science student um"},{"timestamp":2555,"text":"when i was in school but this is a time"},{"timestamp":2558,"text":"it seems"},{"timestamp":2559,"text":"that you know the global scientific"},{"timestamp":2561,"text":"community "},{"timestamp":2562,"text":"is so critically important and we're"},{"timestamp":2564,"text":"really seeing just how important it is"},{"timestamp":2566,"text":"to to follow science yes yes exactly and"},{"timestamp":2571,"text":"and i hope that is she a phd"},{"timestamp":2574,"text":"oh oh yes listen to her message she'll"},{"timestamp":2577,"text":"do 50 seconds of the same thing"},{"timestamp":2579,"text":"we can see now that the scientific"},{"timestamp":2582,"text":"community are stepping up"},{"timestamp":2583,"text":"and they are they are speaking out more"},{"timestamp":2586,"text":"than they have"},{"timestamp":2586,"text":"they're done before you know i gotta"},{"timestamp":2588,"text":"tell you for a 16 year old swedish girl"},{"timestamp":2591,"text":"the term"},{"timestamp":2592,"text":"stepping up like the scientists are"},{"timestamp":2594,"text":"stepping up is an"},{"timestamp":2595,"text":"odd thing for her to be using just in my"},{"timestamp":2597,"text":"opinion you know you"},{"timestamp":2598,"text":"i don't know is that how kids talk about"},{"timestamp":2601,"text":"that "},{"timestamp":2602,"text":"oh the swedes that's all they talk about"},{"timestamp":2604,"text":"stepping up"},{"timestamp":2606,"text":"yes yes exactly and and i hope that"},{"timestamp":2610,"text":"we can see now the the scientific"},{"timestamp":2612,"text":"community are stepping up"},{"timestamp":2614,"text":"and they are they are speaking out more"},{"timestamp":2616,"text":"than they have"},{"timestamp":2617,"text":"they're done before because obviously"},{"timestamp":2620,"text":"this is a crisis that would require the"},{"timestamp":2622,"text":"scientific community to speak up"},{"timestamp":2624,"text":"and um and i hope that people really"},{"timestamp":2628,"text":"it feels like uh science is getting"},{"timestamp":2632,"text":"the role of science is is changing now"},{"timestamp":2635,"text":"it's becoming more"},{"timestamp":2637,"text":"people are starting to realize that we"},{"timestamp":2638,"text":"are actually depending on science and"},{"timestamp":2640,"text":"that we need to listen to scientists"},{"timestamp":2642,"text":"and experts and i i really hope that we"},{"timestamp":2646,"text":"that that stays and that's that also"},{"timestamp":2650,"text":"um is is for for other crises such as"},{"timestamp":2654,"text":"the climate crisis and the environmental"},{"timestamp":2656,"text":"crisis "},{"timestamp":2657,"text":"that we actually understand that we have"},{"timestamp":2660,"text":"to listen to to"},{"timestamp":2662,"text":"the scientists"},{"timestamp":2666,"text":"don't you think that the climate folk"},{"timestamp":2669,"text":"uh are freaked out about this whole"},{"timestamp":2672,"text":"situation because they've been"},{"timestamp":2674,"text":"talking about being put on the back"},{"timestamp":2675,"text":"burner they've been taken
